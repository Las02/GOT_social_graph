0,WAYMAR ROYCE,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene," What d’you expect? They’re savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they’re ripping each other to pieces."
1,WILL,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene," I’ve never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I’ve never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life."
2,WAYMAR ROYCE,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene, How close did you get?
3,WILL,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene, Close as any man would.
4,GARED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene, We should head back to the wall.
5,ROYCE,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene, Do the dead frighten you?
6,GARED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene, Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won’t trouble us no more.
7,ROYCE,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene, You don’t think he’ll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
8,WILL,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene, Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.
9,ROYCE,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene," It’s a good thing we’re not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter … If I don’t catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won’t say it again."
10,ROYCE,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene, Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
11,WILL,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene, They were here.
12,GARED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene, See where they went.
13,ROYCE,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene, What is it?
14,GARED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene, It’s …
15,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2, Go on. Father’s watching.
16,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2, And your mother.
17,SEPTA MORDANE,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3," Fine work, as always. Well done."
18,SANSA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3, Thank you.
19,SEPTA MORDANE,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3, I love the detail that you’ve managed to get in this corners. … Quite beautiful … the stitching …
20,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3," And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on."
21,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3," Don’t think too much, Bran."
22,ROBB,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3, Relax your bow arm.
23,JON/ROBB,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3," Quick, Bran, faster!"
24,CASSEL,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3, Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They’ve captured a deserter from the Night’s Watch.
25,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3, Get the lads to saddle their horses.
26,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3, Do you have to?
27,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3," He swore an oath, Cat."
28,CASSEL,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3," The law is law, my lady."
29,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3," Tell Bran he’s coming, too."
30,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3, Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.
31,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3, He won’t be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
32,ROBB,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3," Lad, go run back and get the rest."
33,WILL,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4," White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them."
34,WILL,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4," I know I broke my oath. And I know I’m a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I’m no coward. Tell them I’m sorry."
35,WILL,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4," Forgive me, lord."
36,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4," In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name …"
37,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4, Don’t look away.
38,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4, King of the Andals and the First Men …
39,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4, Father will know if you do.
40,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4," Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die."
41,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4, You did well.
42,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4, You understand why I did it?
43,BRAN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4, Jon said he was a deserter.
44,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4, But do you understand why I had to kill him?
45,BRAN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4, Our way is the old way?
46,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4, The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
47,BRAN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4, Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
48,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4, The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
49,BRAN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4, So he was lying?
50,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4, A madman sees what he sees.
51,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, What is it?
52,THEON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, Mountain lion?
53,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, There are no mountain lions in these woods.
54,THEON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, It’s a freak.
55,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, It’s a direwolf.
56,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, Tough old beast.
57,ROBB,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
58,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, Now there are five.
59,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, You want to hold it?
60,BRAN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, Where will they go? Their mother’s dead.
61,CASSEL,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, They don’t belong down here.
62,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, Better a quick death. They won’t last without their mother.
63,THEON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, Right. Give it here.
64,BRAN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, NO!
65,ROBB,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, Put away your blade.
66,THEON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5," I take orders from your father, not you."
67,BRAN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5," Please, father!"
68,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5," I’m sorry, Bran."
69,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
70,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5," You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves."
71,BRAN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, What about you?
72,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, I’m not a Stark. Get on.
73,ROBB,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5, What is it?
74,THEON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5," The runt of the litter. That one’s yours, Snow."
75,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_6," As your brother, I feel it’s my duty to warn you"
76,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_6," And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid."
77,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_6," There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We’re Lannisters. Lannisters don’t act like fools."
78,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_6, What if Jon Arryn told someone?
79,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_6, But who would he tell?
80,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_6, My husband.
81,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_6," If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on."
82,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_6, You should be the Hand of the king.
83,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_6," That’s an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short."
84,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_7, All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
85,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_7, You have five northern children. You’re not an outsider.
86,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_7, I wonder if the old gods agree.
87,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_7, It’s your gods with all the rules.
88,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_7," I am so sorry, my love."
89,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_7, Tell me.
90,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_7, There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
91,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_7, Your sister. The boy …
92,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_7, They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
93,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_7," He’s coming this far North, there’s only one thing he’s after."
94,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_7," You can always say no, Ned."
95,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_8, We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion’s chamber. I’m told he reads all night.
96,MAESTER LUWIN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_8, I’m told he drinks all night.
97,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_8, How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.
98,LUWIN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_8, We’ve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we’ll find out.
99,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_8," In any case, candles."
100,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_9, Why’s your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
101,THEON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_9," It’s for the queen, I bet. I hear she’s [sleek as a mink?]"
102,ROBB,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_9, I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
103,THEON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_9, Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
104,ROBB,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_9," Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair."
105,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_10," Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!"
106,BRAN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_10, I saw the king! He’s got hundreds of people!
107,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_10, How many times have I told you
108,BRAN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_10, But he’s coming right now! Down our road!
109,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_10, I want you to promise me
110,BRAN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_10, I promise.
111,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_10, D’you know what?
112,BRAN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_10, What?
113,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_10, You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
114,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11," Where’s Arya? Sansa, where’s your sister?"
115,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11," Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA’s helm]"
116,ARYA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, Move!
117,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, Your Grace.
118,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, You’ve got fat.
119,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, Cat!
120,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, Your Grace.
121,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, Nine years. Why haven’t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
122,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11," Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours."
123,ARYA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, Where’s the Imp?
124,SANSA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, Will you shut up?
125,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11," Who have we here? You must be Robb. (To Sansa) My, you’re a pretty one. (To Arya) Your name is?"
126,ARYA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, Arya.
127,ARYA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, That’s Jaime Lannister. The queen’s twin brother.
128,SANSA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, Would you please shut up.
129,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, My queen.
130,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, My queen.
131,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
132,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11," We’ve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait."
133,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, Ned.
134,ARYA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, Where’s the Imp?
135,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_11, Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
136,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_12, Tell me about Jon Arryn.
137,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_12," One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man."
138,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_12, We both did.
139,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_12," He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what."
140,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_12, Aye.
141,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_12," Don’t look at me like that. Not his fault I didn’t listen. (They laugh. ROBERT sighs.) I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you’re no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king."
142,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_12, I’m not worthy of the honor.
143,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_12," I’m not trying to honor you. I’m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it’s not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We’ll join our Houses."
144,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
145,ROS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, Did you hear the king’s in Winterfell?
146,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, I did hear something about that.
147,ROS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
148,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, And the other brother?
149,ROS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, The queen has two brothers?
150,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, There’s the pretty one. And there’s the clever one.
151,ROS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, I hear they call him the Imp.
152,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, I hear he hates that nickname.
153,ROS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, Oh? I hear he’s more than earned it. I hear he’s a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
154,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, Clever girl.
155,ROS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13," We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion."
156,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, Have you?
157,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, The gods gave me one blessing.
158,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, Don’t get up.
159,ROS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, M’lord.
160,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13," Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
161,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13," You’ve much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention."
162,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13," She has odd cravings, our sister."
163,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13," A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don’t leave me alone with these people."
164,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13," I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses."
165,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13," I thought you might say that. But since we’re short on time, (he opens the door; a bevy of whores enter and descend on TYRION) Come on, girls. See you at sundown."
166,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_13, Close the door!
167,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_14, Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
168,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_14, She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
169,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_14, She belonged with me.
170,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_14," In my dreams, I kill him every night."
171,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_14," It’s done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone."
172,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_14, Not all of them.
173,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_15, Daenerys!
174,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_15, Daenerys! There’s our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn’t he a gracious host?
175,DAENERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_15, We’ve been his guests for over a year and he’s never asked us for anything.
176,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_15," Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. (He pulls off her gown.) You have a woman’s body now. (She endures it as he strokes her breast.) I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?"
177,DAENERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_15, No.
178,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_15," When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today."
179,MAID,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_15," It’s too hot, my lady."
180,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_16, Where is he?
181,ILLYRIO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_16, The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
182,ILLYRIO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_16," (Greets them in Dothraki.) May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen."
183,ILLYRIO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_16," Come forward, my dear."
184,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_16, Where’s he going?
185,ILLYRIO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_16, The ceremony is over.
186,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_16, But he didn’t say anything. Did he like her?
187,ILLYRIO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_16," Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn’t like her, we’d know."
188,ILLYRIO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_17, It won’t be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father’s throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
189,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_17, When will they be married?
190,ILLYRIO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_17, Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
191,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_17, Is it true they lie with their horses?
192,ILLYRIO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_17, I wouldn’t ask Khal Drogo.
193,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_17, Do you take me for a fool?
194,ILLYRIO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_17, I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I’ve given offense.
195,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_17, I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
196,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_17," So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?"
197,DAENERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_17, I don’t know.
198,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_17," We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo’s army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that’s what it took."
199,SANSA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_18, Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I’m ugly?
200,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_18, Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
201,SANSA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_18, He’s so handsome.
202,SANSA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_18, When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
203,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_18, Hush now. Your father hasn’t even said yes.
204,SANSA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_18, Why would he say no? He’d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
205,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_18, He’d have to leave home. He’d have to leave me. And so would you.
206,SANSA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_18, You left your home to come here. And I’d be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
207,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_18, Sansa…
208,SANSA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_18," Please, please. It’s the only thing I ever wanted."
209,BENJEN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, Is he dead yet?
210,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, Uncle Benjen!
211,BENJEN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn’t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren’t you at the feast?
212,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
213,BENJEN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19," Well, you’re always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there."
214,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, So take me with you when you go back.
215,BENJEN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, Jon…
216,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19," Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will."
217,BENJEN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, The Wall isn’t going anywhere.
218,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, I’m ready to swear your oath.
219,BENJEN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, You don’t understand what you’d be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
220,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, I don’t care about that.
221,BENJEN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19," You might, if you knew what it meant. … I’d better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We’ll talk later."
222,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch.
223,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, What’re you doing back there?
224,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, Preparing for a night with your family. I’ve always wanted to see the Wall.
225,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, You’re Tyrion Lannister. The queen’s brother?
226,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19," My greatest accomplishment. You – you’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?"
227,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19," Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though."
228,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
229,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19," And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you."
230,JON,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
231,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_19, All dwarves are bastards in their fathers’ eyes.
232,BENJEN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, You at a feast -- It’s like a bear in a trap.
233,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
234,BENJEN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20," Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger."
235,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
236,BENJEN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, The two he was with are still missing.
237,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, A wildling ambush.
238,BENJEN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
239,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, Winter is coming.
240,ROBB,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, Uncle Benjen.
241,BENJEN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, Robb boy. How are ye?
242,ROBB,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, I’m good.
243,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, Yes. Lovely country.
244,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20," I’m sure it’s very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time."
245,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20," Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?"
246,SANSA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20," Thirteen, Your Grace."
247,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, You’re tall. Still growing?
248,SANSA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20," I think so, Your Grace."
249,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, And have you bled yet?
250,SANSA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20," No, Your Grace."
251,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, And your dress. Did you make it?
252,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, Such talent. You must make something for me.
253,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
254,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, I hear the same.
255,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever.
256,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, Your pardon.
257,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it’s true.
258,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20," Yes, the king has honored me with his offer."
259,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20," I’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale."
260,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, I don’t fight in tournaments.
261,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, No? Getting a little old for it?
262,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20," I don’t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don’t want him to know what I can do."
263,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, Well said.
264,SANSA,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, Arya!
265,ROBB,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_20, Time for bed.
266,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21," I’m a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat’s nest they call a capital."
267,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21, I won’t let him take you.
268,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21, The king takes what he wants. That’s why he’s king.
269,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21," I’ll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.’"
270,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21, How did he get so fat?
271,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21, He only stops eating when it’s time for a drink.
272,A VOICE,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21," It’s Maester Luwin, my lord."
273,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21, Send him in.
274,LUWIN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21," Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister."
275,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21, Stay.
276,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21, This was sent from the Eyrie. What’s she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn’t been back there since her wedding.
277,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21, What news?
278,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21, She’s fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
279,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21," She’s fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn’t know what she’s saying."
280,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21," Lysa’s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son’s life, if she wasn’t certain her husband was murdered?"
281,LUWIN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21," If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?"
282,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21, They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
283,LUWIN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21," The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark’s help. He’s the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord."
284,CATELYN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21, He spent half his life fighting Robert’s wars. He owes him nothing. (To NED) Your father and brother rode south once on a king’s demand.
285,LUWIN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_21, A different time. Different king.
286,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_22, When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
287,ILLYRIO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_22," If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it."
288,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_22, When?
289,ILLYRIO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_22, When their omens favor war.
290,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_22, I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
291,ILLYRIO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_22, A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
292,JORAH,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_22, A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
293,DAENERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_22," Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?"
294,JORAH,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_22," Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king."
295,ILLYRIO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_22," Dragons’ eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful."
296,DAENERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_22," Thank you, Magister."
297,DAENERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_22," She’s beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don’t know how to say ‘thank you’ in Dothraki."
298,JORAH,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_22, There is no word for ‘thank you’ in Dothraki.
299,VISERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_22, Make him happy.
300,KHAL DROGO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_23, No.
301,DAENERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_23, Do you know the Common Tongue?
302,KHAL DROGO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_23, No.
303,DAENERYS,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_23, Is ‘no’ the only word that you know?
304,KHAL DROGO,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_23, No.
305,THE HOUND,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24," Rough night, Imp?"
306,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24," If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle."
307,THE HOUND,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24, I didn’t pick you for a hunter.
308,TYRION,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24, The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
309,THE HOUND,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24, It’s not hunting if you pay for it.
310,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24, Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
311,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24," No, but I’m still better than you."
312,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24, I know what I’m putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You’re a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I’ve got.
313,NED,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24, I hope I’ll serve you well.
314,ROBERT,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24," You will. And I’ll make sure you don’t look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let’s go kill some boar!"
315,BRAN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24," Come on, you."
316,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24, Stop. STOP.
317,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24, Are you completely mad?
318,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24, He saw us.
319,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24, It’s all right. It’s all right.
320,CERSEI,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24, He saw us!
321,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24," I heard you the first time. (To BRAN) Quite the little climber, aren’t you? How old are you, boy?"
322,BRAN,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24, Ten
323,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24, Ten.
324,JAIME,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_24, The things I do for love.
325,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Isn't there anything else?
326,JORAH MORMONT,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, The Dothraki have two things in abundance
327,DOREAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Khaleesi!
328,IRRI,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Your hands.
329,JORAH MORMONT,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there."
330,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
331,JORAH MORMONT,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," As you wish, your Grace."
332,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?"
333,JORAH MORMONT,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
334,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that."
335,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today."
336,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies."
337,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, What good will my sympathies do them?
338,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
339,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
340,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, One word and I'll hit you again.
341,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I'm telling mother!
342,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?"
343,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, You can't...
344,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Do you understand?
345,SANDOR CLEGANE,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," The Prince will remember that, little lord."
346,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast..."
347,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black."
348,JAIME LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Little brother.
349,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Beloved siblings.
350,MYRCELLA BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Is Bran going to die?
351,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Apparently not.
352,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, What do you mean?
353,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, The Maester says the boy may live.
354,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
355,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
356,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
357,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers."
358,JAIME LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
359,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
360,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
361,JAIME LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day."
362,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say."
363,JAIME LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on."
364,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family."
365,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Please.
366,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  I would have dressed, your Grace."
367,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now."
368,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I never knew.
369,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."
370,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I am grateful..
371,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Perhaps this time she'll listen.
372,JAIME LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, A sword for the wall?
373,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I already have one.
374,JAIME LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Good man. Have you swung it yet?
375,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Of course I have.
376,JAIME LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."
377,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
378,JAIME LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Is it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?"
379,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Soon enough.
380,JAIME LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life."
381,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway."
382,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, It's good you've got help.
383,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Watch. Nymeria, gloves."
384,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Impressive.
385,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!"
386,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
387,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  A present?
388,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
389,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  It's so skinny.
390,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."
391,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I can be quick.
392,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
393,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I think so.
394,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, First lesson
395,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I know which end to use.
396,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know."
397,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
398,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I came to say goodbye to Bran.
399,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  You've said it.
400,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."
401,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I want you to leave.
402,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
403,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I have no choice.
404,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't."
405,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  You can. You must.
406,ROBB STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
407,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  You Starks are hard to kill.
408,ROBB STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, My mother?
409,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  She was very kind.
410,ROBB STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."
411,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  It was always my color.
412,ROBB STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Farewell, Snow."
413,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  And you, Stark."
414,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood."
415,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?"
416,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise."
417,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going."
418,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I've half a mind to go with you.
419,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight."
420,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, You should have asked me 20 years ago.
421,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young."
422,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I recall a few chances.
423,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in."
424,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Bessie. She was one of yours.
425,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastard's mother?
426,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Wylla.
427,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
428,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Nor will I.
429,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already."
430,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
431,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night."
432,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
433,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
434,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, She's little more than a child.
435,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
436,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Tell me we're not speaking of this.
437,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on."
438,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?"
439,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."
440,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert."
441,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him."
442,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea."
443,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming."
444,BENJEN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
445,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
446,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Why do you read so much?
447,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Look at me and tell me what you see.
448,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Is this a trick?
449,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."
450,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Until your brother killed that King.
451,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"
452,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
453,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms."
454,JON SNOW,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
455,TYRION LANNISTER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly."
456,MAESTER LUWIN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us."
457,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Talk to Poole about it.
458,MAESTER LUWIN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention..."
459,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I don't care about appointments!
460,ROBB STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
461,MAESTER LUWIN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Very good, my Lord. My Lady."
462,ROBB STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  When was the last time you left this room?
463,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I have to take care of him.
464,ROBB STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed."
465,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
466,ROBB STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying..."
467,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop! (Wolf’s howling repeatedly)
468,ROBB STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
469,ASSASSIN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
470,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  No!
471,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Have you ever seen a dragon?
472,IRRI,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Dragon gone, Khaleesi."
473,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Everywhere? Even in the east?
474,IRRI,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
475,JHIQUI,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, It is known.
476,DOREAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
477,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, The moon?
478,DOREAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire."
479,IRRI,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
480,JHIQUI,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, It is known.
481,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
482,DOREAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy."
483,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, How old were you?
484,DOREAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
485,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Nine?!
486,DOREAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn."
487,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
488,DOREAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Yes.
489,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Will it take three years?
490,DOREAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, No.
491,BENJEN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Welcome.
492,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
493,MAESTER LUWIN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, The boy was always sure-footed before.
494,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
495,THEON GREYJOY,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Saw what, my lady?"
496,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
497,RODRICK CASSEL,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him."
498,ROBB STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
499,THEON GREYJOY,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
500,MAESTER LUWIN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this."
501,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
502,ROBB STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I'll ride to King's Landing.
503,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
504,ROBB STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  Mother, you can't."
505,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I must.
506,RODRICK CASSEL,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
507,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
508,RODRICK CASSEL,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
509,ROBB STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  What about Bran?
510,CATELYN STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
511,DOREAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes."
512,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Finish a man?
513,DOREAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
514,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top."
515,DOREAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you."
516,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
517,DOREAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?"
518,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
519,SANSA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  Pardon me, Ser."
520,SANDOR CLEGANE,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face."
521,SANSA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?"
522,SANDOR CLEGANE,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
523,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me."
524,SANSA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts."
525,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
526,MYCAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I'll get you!
527,SANSA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Arya!
528,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, What are you doing here? Go away.
529,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  Your sister? And who are you, boy?"
530,MYCAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Mycah, my Lord."
531,SANSA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, He the butcher's boy.
532,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, He's my friend.
533,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are."
534,MYCAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to."
535,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword."
536,MYCAH,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick."
537,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?"
538,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Stop it!
539,SANSA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  Arya, stay out of this."
540,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
541,SANSA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!"
542,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  I'll gut you, you little cunt!"
543,SANSA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Arya!
544,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Nymeria!
545,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Please don't.
546,SANSA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,"  Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help."
547,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Then go! Don't touch me.
548,SOLDIER 1,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
549,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
550,SOLDIER 2,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, It's a direwolf.
551,SOLDIER 1,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I'll check down here.
552,SOLDIER 2,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I think I heard a noise.
553,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Go!
554,JORY CASSEL,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
555,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Where is she?
556,JORY CASSEL,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, She's been taken directly before the King.
557,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Who took her?
558,JORY CASSEL,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, The Lannisters found her.
559,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Right, get back."
560,JORY CASSEL,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
561,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Back! Back to the inn. All back!
562,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  I'm sorry.
563,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Are you hurt?
564,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, No.
565,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
566,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
567,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly."
568,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
569,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
570,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
571,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  That's not what happened!
572,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
573,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Liar!
574,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Shut up!
575,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?"
576,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, In bed asleep.
577,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," She's not. Sansa, come here, darling."
578,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King."
579,SANSA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
580,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Liar! Liar liar liar!
581,SANSA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Arya!
582,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Stop it! That's enough of that.
583,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Liar liar liar!
584,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Stop! Arya!
585,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
586,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over."
587,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
588,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
589,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Gladly, your Grace."
590,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
591,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, I'd forgot the damned wolf.
592,SOLDIER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace."
593,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, So be it.
594,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, We have another wolf.
595,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  As you will.
596,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, You can't mean it.
597,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
598,SANSA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!"
599,ARYA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
600,SANSA STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
601,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, s this your command... your Grace?
602,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  Where is the beast?
603,SOLDIER,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Chained up outside, your Grace."
604,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," Ser Ilyn, do me the honor."
605,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26," No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself."
606,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, Is this some trick?
607,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26,  The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
608,EDDARD STARK,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
609,SANDOR CLEGANE,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_26, He ran... Not very fast.
610,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them."
611,JORY CASSEL,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Yes, my Lord."
612,KING’S LANDING GUARD,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, If you'd like to change into something more appropriate…
613,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership."
614,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
615,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes."
616,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
617,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss."
618,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
619,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."
620,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  But you just stood there and watched.
621,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."
622,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
623,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"
624,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  You served him well, when serving was safe."
625,VARYS,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Lord Stark.
626,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Lord Varys.
627,VARYS,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
628,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
629,RENLY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but..."
630,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."
631,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well."
632,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
633,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
634,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
635,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."
636,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Grand Maester.
637,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, How many years has it been? You were a young man.
638,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, And you served another King.
639,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?"
640,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Without the King?
641,RENLY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."
642,VARYS,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
643,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  We are the lords of small matters here.
644,RENLY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
645,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Mmm, how much?"
646,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer."
647,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Can the treasury bear such expense?
648,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
649,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
650,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
651,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  How could you let this happen?
652,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
653,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
654,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen."
655,RENLY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," ""Counting coppers,"" he calls it."
656,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
657,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
658,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride."
659,VARYS,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."
660,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Please, it's nearly healed."
661,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  It's ugly.
662,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."
663,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."
664,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
665,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Do I have to marry her?
666,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
667,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I don't want to.
668,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
669,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
670,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, How would you handle them?
671,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."
672,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  A royal army?
673,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives."
674,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, And if the northerners rebel?
675,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe."
676,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
677,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  For me. I'm their King.
678,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
679,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I'm not asking.
680,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."
681,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
682,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
683,SEPTA MORDANE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food."
684,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I'm practicing.
685,SANSA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Practicing for what?
686,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, The Prince.
687,SEPTA MORDANE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Arya, stop!"
688,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
689,SANSA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, The Hound killed your friend.
690,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
691,SANSA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, You're an idiot.
692,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive."
693,SEPTA MORDANE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Enough!
694,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  What's happening here?
695,SEPTA MORDANE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
696,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…"
697,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
698,SANSA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
699,SEPTA MORDANE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, You've barely eaten a thing.
700,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  It's all right. Go on.
701,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, War was easier than daughters.
702,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Go away!
703,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?"
704,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Mine.
705,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
706,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
707,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Come here. Now what do you want with this?
708,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  It's called Needle.
709,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
710,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Stick 'em with the pointy end.
711,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, [laughs] That's the essence of it.
712,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
713,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy."
714,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa."
715,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
716,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, So was I! He is a liar.
717,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong."
718,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, But how you can let her marry someone like that?
719,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
720,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Winter is coming.
721,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister."
722,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I don't hate her. Not really.
723,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours."
724,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I can keep it?
725,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."
726,OLD NAN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
727,BRAN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I hate your stories.
728,OLD NAN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
729,BRAN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
730,OLD NAN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…"
731,ROBB STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  What are you telling him now?
732,OLD NAN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
733,ROBB STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
734,BRAN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Maybe we do.
735,ROBB STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall."
736,BRAN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead."
737,ROBB STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Don't ever say that.
738,BRAN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I'd rather be dead.
739,RODRICK CASSEL,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many."
740,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
741,RODRICK CASSEL,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, My Lady.
742,GUARD,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?"
743,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I would. We've done nothing wrong.
744,GUARD,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
745,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."
746,GUARD,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Follow me, Lady Stark."
747,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Cat! Go on. Go upstairs. (to his whores)
748,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
749,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
750,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
751,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
752,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
753,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, A dear friend told me.
754,VARYS,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Lady Stark.
755,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Lord Varys.
756,VARYS,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
757,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, How did you know I was coming?
758,VARYS,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
759,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Do you know whose dagger this is?
760,VARYS,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I must admit I do not.
761,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."
762,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Yours?
763,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
764,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, To whom?
765,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
766,ALLISER THORNE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?"
767,ALLISER THORNE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Next!
768,ALLISER THORNE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Next!
769,ALLISER THORNE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day."
770,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, A charming man.
771,JEOR MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
772,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
773,JEOR MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
774,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Good news or bad?
775,JEOR MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Both.
776,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
777,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
778,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  My wife is in Winterfell.
779,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Is she?
780,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
781,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, You're a funny man. A very funny man.
782,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Ned! [poking her head out of a window]
783,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds."
784,GRENN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," You broke my nose, bastard!"
785,JON SNOW,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  It's an improvement.
786,GRENN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit."
787,PYP,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
788,GRENN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," What're you looking at, halfman?"
789,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
790,RAST,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, What do you care about our faces?
791,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
792,GRENN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," We'll talk later, Lord Snow."
793,JON SNOW,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
794,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice
795,JON SNOW,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, They hate me because I'm better than they are.
796,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
797,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
798,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, We have proof. We have the blade.
799,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."
800,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
801,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."
802,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
803,PETYR BAELISH,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
804,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, How could you be so stupid?
805,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Calm down.
806,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
807,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
808,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
809,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Then what are you raving about?
810,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
811,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
812,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, And my husband?
813,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us 
814,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Let me go.
815,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Never.
816,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Let me go.
817,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
818,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I wish I could see the girls.
819,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  It's too dangerous.
820,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Just for a moment.
821,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Until we know who our enemies are...
822,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."
823,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
824,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, And if you find the proof?
825,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."
826,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
827,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, He still loves you.
828,CATELYN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Does he?
829,EDDARD STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Off with you.
830,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
831,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Of course, your Grace."
832,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Who was it?
833,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
834,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, How'd you do it?
835,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Lance through the heart.
836,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?"
837,LANCEL LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," It's empty, your Grace."
838,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, What do you mean it's empty?
839,LANCEL LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, There's no more wine.
840,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
841,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
842,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old."
843,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
844,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."
845,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Your outlaw... Any last words?
846,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," I cut his head off, so no."
847,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
848,JAIME LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace..."
849,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, 
850,JORAH MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
851,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, From whom?
852,JORAH MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices "
853,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Tell them all to stop.
854,JORAH MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
855,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Until I command them otherwise.
856,JORAH MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  You're learning to talk like a Queen.
857,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
858,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
859,IRRI,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
860,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  No!
861,IRRI,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."
862,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed."
863,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
864,JORAH MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?"
865,RAKHARO,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, You walk. [to Viserys]
866,BENJEN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
867,JON SNOW,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, You're leaving?
868,BENJEN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
869,JON SNOW,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  What kind of reports?
870,BENJEN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  The kind I don't want to believe.
871,JON SNOW,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, 'm ready. I won't let you down.
872,BENJEN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon."
873,JON SNOW,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, But I'm better than every...
874,BENJEN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return."
875,YOREN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, A bear's balls.
876,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, You're joking?
877,YOREN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
878,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, And how do a bear's balls taste?
879,YOREN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"
880,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
881,YOREN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
882,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
883,BENJEN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"
884,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
885,BENJEN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."
886,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
887,BENJEN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Call me what you like.
888,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
889,BENJEN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."
890,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
891,BENJEN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."
892,YOREN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm."
893,BENJEN STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Enjoy the capital, brother."
894,YOREN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I always do.
895,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
896,YOREN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
897,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
898,YOREN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
899,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
900,YOREN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord."
901,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
902,IRRI,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Yes, Khaleesi."
903,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  What are you doing?
904,IRRI,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion."
905,JORAH MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."
906,RAKHARO,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses.
907,JORAH MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Armor.
908,RAKHARO,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
909,JORAH MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Slow.
910,RAKHARO,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Slow.
911,JORAH MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," It's true, but it also keeps a man alive."
912,RAKHARO,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
913,JORAH MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior.
914,RAKHARO,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?"
915,JORAH MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
916,IRRI,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
917,RAKHARO,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, There are no rabbits.
918,IRRI,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Find some ducks, she likes ducks."
919,RAKHARO,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?"
920,IRRI,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
921,JORAH MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I don't think she wants to eat dog.
922,IRRI,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
923,RAKHARO,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, A blessing from the Great Stallion.
924,IRRI,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, She does not want to eat horse.
925,JORAH MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
926,RHAKARO,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
927,JORAH MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
928,JON SNOW,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
929,MAESTER AEMON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"
930,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Eight... no, nine."
931,MAESTER AEMON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, All of them brief?
932,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
933,MAESTER AEMON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually 
934,JEOR MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers."
935,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
936,JEOR MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
937,MAESTER AEMON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
938,JEOR MORMONT,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
939,MAESTER AEMON,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready."
940,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  It’s a boy.
941,KHAL DROGO,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, How do you know?
942,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I know.
943,JON SNOW,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
944,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
945,JON SNOW,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
946,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
947,JON SNOW,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
948,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, Of course.
949,JON SNOW,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, He'll never walk again.
950,TYRION LANNISTER,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."
951,JON SNOW,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Farewell, My Lord."
952,SYRIO FOREL,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday."
953,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  Who are you?
954,SYRIO FOREL,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Your dancing master, Syrio Forel."
955,SYRIO FOREL,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it."
956,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  It's too heavy.
957,SYRIO FOREL,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
958,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, What if I drop it?
959,SYRIO FOREL,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."
960,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28, I'm a girl.
961,SYRIO FOREL,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,"  Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding..."
962,ARYA STARK,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28,  A needle.
963,SYRIO FOREL,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me."
964,SYRIO FOREL,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_28," Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster.4Embed"
965,THEON GREYJOY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, We have visitors.
966,BRAN STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I don't want to see anyone.
967,THEON GREYJOY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting."
968,BRAN STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I don't want to go.
969,THEON GREYJOY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! (Hodor enters, hoisting up Bran and carrying him away) Help Bran down the hall."
970,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
971,ROBB STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
972,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
973,ROBB STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away."
974,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
975,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
976,MAESTER LUWIN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, He has no memory of that day.
977,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Curious.
978,ROBB STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Why are you here?
979,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
980,BRAN STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Kneel, Hodor."
981,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Do you like to ride, Bran?"
982,BRAN STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Yes. Well, I mean I did like to."
983,MAESTER LUWIN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, The boy has lost the use of his legs.
984,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
985,BRAN STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I'm not a cripple.
986,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
987,BRAN STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Will I really be able to ride?
988,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
989,ROBB STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
990,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
991,ROBB STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
992,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier."
993,THEON GREYJOY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros."
994,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters."
995,THEON GREYJOY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, He's not my master.
996,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?"
997,THEON GREYJOY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, She wasn't feeling well.
998,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?"
999,THEON GREYJOY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, My lady's whereabouts...
1000,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?"
1001,THEON GREYJOY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Must have been a pretty sight.
1002,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."
1003,THEON GREYJOY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, We were outnumbered 10 to one.
1004,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire."
1005,THEON GREYJOY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Careful, Imp."
1006,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out."
1007,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it."
1008,GRENN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, What in seven hells is that?
1009,PYP,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
1010,ALLISER THORNE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Tell them your name.
1011,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black."
1012,RAST,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Come to take the black pudding.
1013,ALLISER THORNE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do."
1014,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I yield. Please, no more."
1015,ALLISER THORNE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder."
1016,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Enough! He yielded.
1017,ALLISER THORNE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Looks like the bastard's in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard."
1018,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Are you sure you want to do this?
1019,GRENN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, No. Yield yield yield! I yield.
1020,ALLISER THORNE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.
1021,PYP,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Well fought!
1022,GRENN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Piss off.
1023,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Did he hurt you?
1024,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  I've had worse.
1025,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.
1026,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself."
1027,GRENN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Why didn't you get up and fight?
1028,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I wanted to. I just couldn't.
1029,GRENN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Why not?
1030,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I'm a coward. My father always says so.
1031,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  The Wall's no place for cowards.
1032,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.
1033,GRENN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.
1034,PYP,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You're too stupid to be a coward.
1035,GRENN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You're too stupid to be a...
1036,PYP,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Quick now, before summer's over."
1037,GRENN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Come on here!
1038,JORAH MORMONT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.
1039,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.
1040,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.
1041,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army."
1042,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?"
1043,JORAH MORMONT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
1044,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, But if they did?
1045,JORAH MORMONT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different."
1046,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, And you know these men?
1047,JORAH MORMONT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land."
1048,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You sold slaves.
1049,JORAH MORMONT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Aye.
1050,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Why?
1051,JORAH MORMONT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I had no money and an expensive wife.
1052,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, And where is she now?
1053,JORAH MORMONT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," In another place, with another man."
1054,DOREAH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Your Grace?
1055,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Yes, my dear?"
1056,DOREAH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, They call you the last dragon...
1057,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, They do.
1058,DOREAH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You have dragon's blood in your veins?
1059,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, It's entirely possible.
1060,DOREAH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
1061,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles."
1062,DOREAH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
1063,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,Really? Why dragons?
1064,DOREAH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy."
1065,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy."
1066,DOREAH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I was not locked in. I have seen things.
1067,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, What have you seen?
1068,DOREAH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
1069,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, A pirate ship?
1070,DOREAH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, A dragon.
1071,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen "
1072,DOREAH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, What happened to the skulls?
1073,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind."
1074,DOREAH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, That's very sad.
1075,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?"
1076,DOREAH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," No, your Grace. To teach your sister."
1077,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.
1078,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince..."
1079,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, What if I have a girl?
1080,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them."
1081,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, What if I only have girls?
1082,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I wouldn't worry about that.
1083,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls."
1084,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Yes, but it's highly unlikely."
1085,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, But what if?
1086,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother."
1087,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, And everyone would hate me.
1088,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Nobody could ever hate you.
1089,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Joffrey does.
1090,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...
1091,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Please shut up about it.
1092,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?
1093,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Aegon the Conqueror.
1094,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, And who built the Red Keep?
1095,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Maegor the Cruel.
1096,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, And how many years did it take to build...
1097,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?"
1098,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes."
1099,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, The Mad King.
1100,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Commonly known as the Mad King.
1101,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Why were they killed?
1102,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You should speak to your father about these matters.
1103,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I don't want to speak to my father, ever."
1104,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
1105,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," No, I won't."
1106,JANOS SLYNT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," It's the Hand's tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords."
1107,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.
1108,JANOS SLYNT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters."
1109,VARYS,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Dreadful.
1110,RENLY BARATHEON,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can."
1111,JANOS SLYNT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I need more men.
1112,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
1113,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I will?
1114,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"  You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left."
1115,JANOS SLYNT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use."
1116,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," The sooner this is over, the better."
1117,VARYS,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes."
1118,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
1119,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?"
1120,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," This heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord."
1121,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.
1122,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel."
1123,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Why?
1124,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
1125,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  What did Jon want the night before he died?
1126,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, He came inquiring after a book.
1127,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  A book? What book?
1128,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome."
1129,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I'd like to read it.
1130,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," ""The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children."""
1131,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"  ""Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained"
1132,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read."
1133,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
1134,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask."
1135,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Jon's death...
1136,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Such a tragedy.
1137,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
1138,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating"
1139,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"  ""The seed is strong""? What does that mean?"
1140,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words."
1141,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
1142,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, What else could it be?
1143,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Poison.
1144,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
1145,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
1146,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?"
1147,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Everybody knows that.
1148,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know."
1149,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I've taken enough of your time.
1150,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor..."
1151,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Thank you. I'll find my own way out.
1152,ARYA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
1153,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  It's a hard fall down these steps.
1154,ARYA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
1155,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Cats? Syrio says…
1156,ARYA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
1157,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  He's right about that.
1158,ARYA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?
1159,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, He needs to get his strength back first.
1160,ARYA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"He wants to be a knight of the King’s Guard. He can't be one now, can he?"
1161,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
1162,ARYA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
1163,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
1164,ARYA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, No. That's not me.
1165,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well."
1166,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.
1167,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," No, that's all right. I'm fine."
1168,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You're not. You're freezing.
1169,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I don't like high places.
1170,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"  You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?"
1171,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. ""You're almost a man now,"" he said, ""but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,"" he said, ""then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more."" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?"
1172,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"  Yes, he is."
1173,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I'm not going to get any better, you know?"
1174,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Well… You can't get any worse.
1175,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I hear you're reading a boring book.
1176,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Pycelle talks too much.
1177,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death."
1178,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
1179,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I promised Cat that I'd help you.
1180,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.
1181,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
1182,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Varys or the Queen?
1183,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
1184,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Yes.
1185,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel."
1186,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Why?
1187,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death."
1188,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you."
1189,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
1190,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!
1191,HUGH OF THE VALE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," As you can see, I'm busy."
1192,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard."
1193,HUGH OF THE VALE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser..."
1194,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," No ""ser."" I'm not a knight."
1195,HUGH OF THE VALE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I see. Well, it just so happens that I am."
1196,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see."
1197,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
1198,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where."
1199,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Let them look.
1200,TOBHO MOTT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage."
1201,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  What did Lord Arryn want?
1202,TOBHO MOTT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, He always came to see the boy.
1203,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  I'd like to see him as well.
1204,TOBHO MOTT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad."
1205,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, This is fine work.
1206,GENDRY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, It's not for sale.
1207,TOBHO MOTT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet..."
1208,GENDRY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I made it for me.
1209,TOBHO MOTT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Forgive him, my Lord."
1210,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?"
1211,GENDRY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," He just asked me questions is all, my Lord."
1212,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, What kind of questions?
1213,GENDRY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother."
1214,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Your mother?
1215,GENDRY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Who she was, what she looked like."
1216,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, What did you tell him?
1217,GENDRY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.
1218,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me."
1219,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Find anything?
1220,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, King Robert's bastard son.
1221,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, This is for the King from Lord Stark.
1222,JAIME LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.
1223,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Three? Four?
1224,JAIME LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
1225,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Forgive me, my Lord..."
1226,JAIME LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
1227,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," We've met before, you know."
1228,JAIME LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"  Have we? Strange, I've forgotten."
1229,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
1230,JAIME LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, That's where you got your scar?
1231,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
1232,JAIME LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Vicious sons of whores.
1233,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, They like their bloodshed.
1234,JAIME LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
1235,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
1236,JAIME LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
1237,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Theon? He's a good lad.
1238,JAIME LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  I doubt it.
1239,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.
1240,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
1241,JAIME LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I don't serve Lord Stark.
1242,GRENN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Where have you been?
1243,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Watch duty. With Sam.
1244,PYP,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Prince Porkchop. Where is he?
1245,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, He wasn't hungry.
1246,PYP,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Impossible!
1247,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him."
1248,RAST,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon."
1249,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  No one touches Sam.
1250,ALLISER THORNE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there."
1251,GRENN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield."
1252,ALLISER THORNE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?"
1253,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!
1254,DOREAH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked."
1255,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us."
1256,IRRI,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Yes, Khaleesi."
1257,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Why did you hit her?!
1258,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.
1259,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
1260,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, What's this?
1261,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, It's a gift. I had it made for you.
1262,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
1263,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Please.
1264,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, This stinks of manure. All of it.
1265,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Stop - stop it.
1266,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair."
1267,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
1268,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You do not talk back to me!
1269,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
1270,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
1271,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
1272,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I wouldn't doubt it.
1273,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
1274,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Sally on the side?
1275,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd."
1276,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
1277,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
1278,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"  As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."
1279,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I find that hard to believe.
1280,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"  I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
1281,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,You didn't know where to put it?
1282,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  I know where to put it.
1283,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,Was she... Old and ugly?
1284,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
1285,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, What color hair?
1286,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Red.
1287,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I like red hair. And her... Her...
1288,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  You don't want to know.
1289,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, That good?
1290,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Better.
1291,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
1292,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  What's my name?
1293,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Jon Snow?
1294,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  And why is my surname Snow?
1295,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Because... You're a bastard from the north.
1296,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
1297,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, So... You didn't know where to put it?
1298,ALLISER THORNE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys."
1299,SAMWELL TARLY,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, It is a bit nippy.
1300,ALLISER THORNE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?"
1301,JON SNOW,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I build my own fires.
1302,ALLISER THORNE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies."
1303,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I hit him. I hit the dragon.
1304,JORAH MORMONT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
1305,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, He is still the true King.
1306,JORAH MORMONT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, The truth now
1307,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
1308,JORAH MORMONT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play."
1309,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?"
1310,JORAH MORMONT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Home.
1311,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.
1312,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Lover's quarrel?
1313,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I'm sorry. Do I...?
1314,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known..."
1315,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
1316,ARYA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Why do they call you Littlefinger?
1317,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Arya!
1318,SEPTA MORDANE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Don't be rude!
1319,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname."
1320,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
1321,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Gods, who is that?"
1322,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Hound's older brother.
1323,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, And his opponent?
1324,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
1325,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!"
1326,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story."
1327,SANSA STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I won't tell anyone. I promise.
1328,PETYR BAELISH,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you."
1329,JORY CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," My Lord, Her Grace the Queen."
1330,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Your Grace.
1331,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You're missing your tournament.
1332,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
1333,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
1334,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  She likes it here.
1335,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her."
1336,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, What are you doing here?
1337,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,  I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
1338,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"  The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise."
1339,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces."
1340,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"  If that's my job, then so be it."
1341,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow."
1342,EDDARD STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,"  I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace."
1343,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, As was I.
1344,MARILLION,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!"
1345,CATELYN STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, And to you.
1346,RODRICK CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly."
1347,MARILLION,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?"
1348,RODRICK CASSEL,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, I'd rather throw myself down a well.
1349,MARILLION,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!"
1350,MASHA HEDDLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room."
1351,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room."
1352,MASHA HEDDLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Truly, my lord, we have nothing."
1353,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
1354,BRONN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, You can have my room.
1355,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me."
1356,YOREN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," Aye, my Lord."
1357,MARILLION,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!
1358,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
1359,MASHA HEDDLE,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Lady Stark.
1360,CATELYN STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?"
1361,KNIGHT OF HOUSE WHENT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," It is, my Lady."
1362,CATELYN STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
1363,KNIGHT OF HOUSE WHENT,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, She is.
1364,CATELYN STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
1365,KNIGHT OF HOUSE BRACKEN,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30, Our lord is honored by his trust.
1366,TYRION LANNISTER,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this."
1367,CATELYN STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30,Knight of House Frey
1368,CATELYN STARK,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_30," This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice."
1369,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
1370,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, He'd never worn this armor before.
1371,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
1372,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Who determines the draw?
1373,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark."
1374,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters."
1375,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
1376,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her."
1377,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
1378,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
1379,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime."
1380,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
1381,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
1382,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Yes. That will never happen.
1383,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Robert tends to do what he wants.
1384,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion."
1385,LANCEL LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go."
1386,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
1387,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You're too fat for your armor.
1388,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?"
1389,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Oh, it’s funny, is it?"
1390,LANCEL LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," No, Your Grace."
1391,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, No? You don't like the Hand's joke?
1392,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You're torturing the poor boy.
1393,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!"
1394,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, The breastplate stretcher?
1395,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, How long before he figures it out?
1396,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Maybe you should have one invented.
1397,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance."
1398,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
1399,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
1400,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, And who's going to hit you back?
1401,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
1402,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32,There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
1403,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
1404,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Aye.
1405,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, … Drink.
1406,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I'm not thirsty.
1407,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
1408,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Your squire... A Lannister boy?
1409,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. ""Cersei Lannister will make a good match"", he told me. ""You'll need her father on your side."" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood."
1410,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Robert?
1411,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!"
1412,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Where's Arya
1413,SANSA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.
1414,SANSA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Thank you, Ser Loras."
1415,SANSA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
1416,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Hey.
1417,SANSA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I can't watch.
1418,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, 100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
1419,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I'll take that bet.
1420,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
1421,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Or you could even buy a friend.
1422,SANSA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, He's going to die.
1423,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Ser Loras rides well.
1424,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend."
1425,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?"
1426,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really."
1427,SANSA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
1428,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, No honor but quite a bit of gold.
1429,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Stop this madness in the name of your King!
1430,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I owe you my life, Ser."
1431,SANDOR CLEGANE,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I'm no Ser.
1432,CATELYN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Remove his hood.
1433,MARILLION,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold. (singing)"
1434,TYRION LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
1435,CATELYN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I did... often and loudly.
1436,TYRION LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?"
1437,CATELYN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, And why would I do that?
1438,TYRION LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
1439,CATELYN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
1440,TYRION LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?"
1441,CATELYN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Five years ago.
1442,TYRION LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here."
1443,CATELYN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I am not a murderer, Lannister."
1444,TYRION LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
1445,CATELYN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, The dagger found
1446,TYRION LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
1447,RODRIK CASSEL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Should I gag him?
1448,TYRION LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Why? Am I starting to make sense?
1449,RODRIK CASSEL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," My Lady, this way."
1450,TYRION LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Untie me. If I die, what's the point?"
1451,CATELYN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Rodrik?
1452,RODRIK CASSEL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself."
1453,BRONN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32,  Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
1454,TYRION LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Well, I'm willing if she is."
1455,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Bran...
1456,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," The Iron Islands. Sigil - a Kraken. Words - ""We do not sow""."
1457,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Lords?
1458,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, The Greyjoys.
1459,THEON GREYJOY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking."
1460,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, And failed rebellions.
1461,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Sigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King.
1462,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Good.
1463,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Words - ""Ours is the fury"". Lords - the Baratheons."
1464,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32,
1465,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, The Westerlands - sigil - a lion.
1466,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Hmm...
1467,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Words - ""A Lannister always pays his debts."""
1468,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," No. A common saying, but not their official motto."
1469,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Lords - the Lannisters.
1470,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, We're still on their words.
1471,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I don't know them.
1472,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You do know them. Think.
1473,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," ""Unbowed, unbent, unbroken""."
1474,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32,That's House Martell.
1475,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," ""Righteous in wrath""."
1476,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, House Hornwood.
1477,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," ""Family, duty, honor""."
1478,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32,Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?
1479,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," ""Family, duty, honor""... Is that the right order?"
1480,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32,You know it is.
1481,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Family comes first?
1482,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
1483,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?"
1484,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
1485,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, And then she left!
1486,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely."
1487,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Why did she leave?
1488,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon."
1489,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Do you know where she is now? Today?
1490,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32,"No, I don't."
1491,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?
1492,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
1493,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I'll never shoot another arrow.
1494,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, And where is that written?
1495,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You need legs to work a bow.
1496,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback."
1497,BRAN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Really?
1498,MAESTER LUWIN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?
1499,THEON GREYJOY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
1500,ROS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
1501,THEON GREYJOY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Important enough for the likes of you.
1502,ROS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know."
1503,THEON GREYJOY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
1504,ROS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Jealous?
1505,THEON GREYJOY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Why should I be jealous?
1506,THEON GREYJOY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
1507,ROS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Might surprise you.
1508,THEON GREYJOY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Hmm?
1509,ROS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
1510,THEON GREYJOY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
1511,ROS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You are jealous.
1512,THEON GREYJOY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."
1513,ROS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, And what about the Starks?
1514,THEON GREYJOY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I’ve been Lord Stark’s ward since I was eight years old.
1515,ROS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," A “ward”, that’s a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…"
1516,THEON GREYJOY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
1517,ROS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You’re a very serious boy.
1518,THEON GREYJOY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I’m not a boy.
1519,ROS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock."
1520,THEON GREYJOY,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I don’t want to pay for it.
1521,ROS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Then get yourself a wife.
1522,ARYA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
1523,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," How is your son, my Lord?"
1524,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, He'll never walk again.
1525,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, But his mind is sound?
1526,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, So they say.
1527,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32,A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
1528,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
1529,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
1530,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I didn't trust you.
1531,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, So why do you trust me now?
1532,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
1533,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, What sort of doom does the King face?
1534,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
1535,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Who gave it to him?
1536,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
1537,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," The squire, Ser Hugh?"
1538,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
1539,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?"
1540,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Someone who could afford it.
1541,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
1542,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, He started asking questions.
1543,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
1544,ILLYRIO MOPATIS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
1545,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
1546,ILLYRIO MOPATIS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
1547,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, This Hand is not the other.
1548,ILLYRIO MOPATIS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
1549,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," ""Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."
1550,ILLYRIO MOPATIS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, It never was.
1551,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
1552,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You do move quietly.
1553,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, We all have our qualities.
1554,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
1555,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
1556,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
1557,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
1558,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."
1559,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
1560,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
1561,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
1562,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."
1563,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Strictly speaking.
1564,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."
1565,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
1566,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
1567,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
1568,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Saw me with your own eyes?
1569,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Eyes I own.
1570,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
1571,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
1572,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, One shudders at the thought.
1573,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Oh.
1574,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
1575,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Have you?
1576,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
1577,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Was that you under the bed?
1578,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
1579,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Oh, please."
1580,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
1581,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming."
1582,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, To a small council meeting?
1583,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
1584,GUARD 1,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Off with you. No begging.
1585,ARYA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I'm not a beggar. I live here.
1586,GUARD 1,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
1587,ARYA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I want to see my father.
1588,GUARD 2,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me."
1589,GUARD 1,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends."
1590,ARYA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
1591,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
1592,ARYA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, They said they were going to kill you.
1593,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Who did?
1594,ARYA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I didn't see them, but I think one was fat."
1595,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Oh, Arya."
1596,ARYA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
1597,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Where did you hear this?
1598,ARYA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
1599,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, What were you doing in the dungeons?
1600,ARYA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Chasing a cat.
1601,JORY CASSEL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent."
1602,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Your name, friend?"
1603,YOREN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look."
1604,ARYA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I'm a girl!
1605,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Did Benjen send you?
1606,YOREN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."
1607,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Ah, we'll find recruits for you."
1608,YOREN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow."
1609,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Know what?
1610,YOREN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Best said in private, my Lord."
1611,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Go on. We'll talk more later.
1612,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Jory, take her safely to her room."
1613,JORY CASSEL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Come along, my Lady. You heard your father."
1614,ARYA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, How many guards does my father have?
1615,JORY CASSEL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
1616,ARYA STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
1617,JORY CASSEL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," No fear on that count, little Lady."
1618,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Well?
1619,YOREN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp."
1620,VARDIS EGEN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," You're far from home, Lady Stark."
1621,CATELYN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, To whom do I speak?
1622,VARDIS EGEN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"
1623,CATELYN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, There was no time to send word.
1624,VARDIS EGEN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?"
1625,CATELYN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
1626,VARDIS EGEN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, He doesn't look like a prisoner.
1627,CATELYN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, My sister will decide what he looks like.
1628,VARDIS EGEN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Yes, my Lady. She will at that."
1629,TYRION LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
1630,BRONN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
1631,TYRION LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I like you.
1632,STEWARD,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called."
1633,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I need to see the King first -- alone.
1634,STEWARD,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you."
1635,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Is it about my wife?
1636,STEWARD,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."
1637,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, The whore is pregnant.
1638,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You're speaking of murdering a child.
1639,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead."
1640,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
1641,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!"
1642,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Then we're no better than the Mad King.
1643,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Careful, Ned. Careful now."
1644,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
1645,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child."
1646,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Based on whose information?
1647,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
1648,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
1649,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."
1650,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?"
1651,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?
1652,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
1653,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
1654,VARYS,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
1655,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?"
1656,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, We should have had them both killed years ago.
1657,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it."
1658,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I followed you into war -  twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child."
1659,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, She dies.
1660,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I will have no part in it.
1661,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will."
1662,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
1663,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!"
1664,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
1665,JORY CASSEL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you."
1666,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned."
1667,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, What can I do for you?
1668,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, When do you return to Winterfell?
1669,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Why? What do you care?
1670,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you."
1671,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I don't have the time.
1672,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
1673,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
1674,JORY CASSEL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Heward and Wyl.
1675,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Find them and meet me at the stables.
1676,LYSA ARRYN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, ""the seed is strong."" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale."
1677,CATELYN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-"
1678,LYSA ARRYN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
1679,ROBIN ARRYN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Mommy? Is that the bad man?
1680,LYSA ARRYN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, It is.
1681,ROBIN ARRYN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, He's little.
1682,LYSA ARRYN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
1683,TYRION LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
1684,LYSA ARRYN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
1685,TYRION LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do."
1686,ROBIN ARRYN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!"
1687,LYSA ARRYN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby."
1688,ROBIN ARRYN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
1689,LYSA ARRYN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Perhaps you will, my little love."
1690,CATELYN STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
1691,LYSA ARRYN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord."
1692,MORD,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!"
1693,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
1694,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man."
1695,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You're jealous.
1696,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Are you sure this won't hurt?
1697,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Only if I slip.
1698,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, And you prefer me like this?
1699,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Mhmm.
1700,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy."
1701,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I want you.
1702,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?"
1703,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Hold still.
1704,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood."
1705,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.
1706,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32,His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
1707,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.
1708,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
1709,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
1710,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you."
1711,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Yes well, I guess we'll never know."
1712,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Everywhere?
1713,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
1714,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
1715,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
1716,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money."
1717,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I have an outrageous amount of money.
1718,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Not as much as the Lannisters.
1719,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, But a lot more than you.
1720,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King."
1721,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Hmm... How did that ever happen?
1722,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
1723,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Do you know who should be King?
1724,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Be serious.
1725,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you."
1726,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I'm fourth in line.
1727,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
1728,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Stannis?
1729,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
1730,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, He's still my older brother.
1731,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, What are you doing?!
1732,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Look at it.
1733,RENLY BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You cut me!
1734,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you."
1735,LORAS TYRELL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King."
1736,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
1737,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
1738,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
1739,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
1740,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
1741,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."
1742,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
1743,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out."
1744,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Is my father wrong?
1745,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."
1746,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, We still outnumber them.
1747,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
1748,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Five.
1749,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."
1750,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, What do you want?
1751,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together."
1752,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Our marriage.
1753,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?"
1754,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Every day.
1755,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, How long can hate hold a thing together?
1756,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Well, seventeen years is quite a long time."
1757,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Yes, it is."
1758,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Yes, it tis. What was she like?"
1759,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?"
1760,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
1761,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, So why now?
1762,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
1763,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind."
1764,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," I felt something for you once, you know?"
1765,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I know.
1766,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?"
1767,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
1768,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, It doesn't make me feel anything.
1769,MHAEGEN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair."
1770,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Aye.
1771,MHAEGEN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is."
1772,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I will.
1773,MHAEGEN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me."
1774,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?"
1775,MHAEGEN,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy."
1776,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
1777,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink."
1778,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
1779,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Well, he has more than you, for a start."
1780,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, How many?
1781,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
1782,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
1783,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
1784,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Come.
1785,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Jory!
1786,JORY CASSEL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, My Lord.
1787,JAIME LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Such a small pack of wolves.
1788,JORY CASSEL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!"
1789,JAIME LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
1790,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," What's the meaning of this, Lannister?"
1791,JAIME LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."
1792,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, I remember him well.
1793,JAIME LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?"
1794,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32,He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
1795,PETYR BAELISH,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
1796,JAIME LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand."
1797,JORY CASSEL,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, If you threaten my Lord again...
1798,JAIME LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?"
1799,EDDARD STARK,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," You kill me, your brother's a dead man."
1800,JAIME LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32, You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
1801,JAIME LANNISTER,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_32," My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back."
1802,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Do you know what your wife has done?
1803,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  She did nothing I did not command.
1804,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Who’d have thought she had it in her?
1805,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
1806,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  I am the King’s Hand -
1807,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You were the King’s Hand!
1808,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  - trying to keep the peace -
1809,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You shall now be held accountable.
1810,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you’ll make your peace with Jaime."
1811,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, He butchered my men.
1812,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
1813,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Quiet, woman."
1814,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
1815,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I took you for a king.
1816,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Hold your tongue.
1817,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, He’s attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.
1818,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
1819,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Wear it in silence or I’ll honor you again.
1820,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not… That was not kingly.
1821,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  If we don’t act… there will be a war.
1822,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King’s Landing. She’s had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it."
1823,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
1824,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," I’m half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don’t know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don’t want to know. This is what matters - I can’t rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other’s throats, so enough!"
1825,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,"  As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight."
1826,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I’m the king, I get what I want… I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it’s true. You were the brother I chose. We’ll talk when I return from the hunt."
1827,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, The hunt?
1828,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Killing things clears my head. You’ll have to sit on the throne while I’m away. You’ll hate it more than I do.
1829,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, The Targaryen girl -
1830,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Seven hells! Don’t start with her again! The girl will die and I’ll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I’ll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister."
1831,IRRI,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Khaleesi?
1832,IRRI,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Oh, Khaleesi!"
1833,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You’re hurt.
1834,ROBB STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Not too fast.
1835,BRAN STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Come on, Dancer. (to his horse)"
1836,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, When are you gonna tell him?
1837,ROBB STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Not now.
1838,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.
1839,ROBB STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You’re talking about war.
1840,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I’m talking about justice.
1841,ROBB STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
1842,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, A Lannister put his spear through your father’s leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -
1843,ROBB STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!
1844,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You’re not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They’ve already started the war. It’s your duty to represent your House when your father can’t.
1845,ROBB STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," And it’s not your duty, because it’s not your House."
1846,ROBB STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Where’s Bran?
1847,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I don’t know. It’s not my House.
1848,BRAN STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Robb?
1849,OSHA,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, All alone in the deep dark woods.
1850,BRAN STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," I’m not alone, my brother is with me."
1851,WILDLING,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I don’t see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?
1852,OSHA,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Oh, that’s a pretty pin. Silver."
1853,WILDLING,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, We’ll take the pin. And the horse. Get down… Be quick about it.
1854,BRAN STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," I can’t. The saddle, the straps."
1855,WILDLING,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, What’s wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?
1856,BRAN STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," I’m Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don’t let me be, I’ll have you all killed!"
1857,WILDLING 2,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
1858,OSHA,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, the boy’s worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark’s own blood. Think what Mance would give us.
1859,WILDLING,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. We’re going as far south as south goes. There ain’t no white walkers down in Dorne.
1860,ROBB STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Drop the knife. Let him go and I’ll let you live.
1861,BRAN STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Robb!
1862,WILDLING,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Shut up! Drop the blade!
1863,BRAN STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," No, don’t."
1864,WILDLING,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Do it.
1865,ROBB STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Are you all right?
1866,BRAN STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Yes, it doesn’t hurt."
1867,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you’re not a man until you’ve killed your first enemy. Well done."
1868,ROBB STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Have you lost your mind? What if you’d missed?
1869,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, He would have killed you and cut Bran’s throat.
1870,ROBB STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You don’t have the right -
1871,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," To what, to save your brother’s life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it."
1872,ROBB STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, What about her?
1873,OSHA,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Give me my life, my lord, and I’m yours."
1874,ROBB STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, We’ll keep her alive.
1875,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!
1876,MORD,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Dwarf man making noise!
1877,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, How would you like to be rich?
1878,MORD,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Dwarf man still making noise.
1879,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I’m prepared to give you lots of gold."
1880,MORD,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, No gold!
1881,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Well, I don’t have it here."
1882,MORD,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, No gold! Fuck off.
1883,ARYA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  I don’t want to practice today.
1884,SYRIO FOREL,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, No?
1885,ARYA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don’t care about stupid wooden swords.
1886,SYRIO FOREL,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You are troubled.
1887,ARYA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  Yes -
1888,SYRIO FOREL,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens."
1889,ARYA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I don’t like dolls and k -
1890,SYRIO FOREL,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You’re not here. You’re with your trouble. If you’re with your trouble when fighting happens…
1891,SYRIO FOREL,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," … More trouble for you. Just so… How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?"
1892,SYRIO FOREL,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, The old and the new.
1893,SYRIO FOREL,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, There is only one god. And his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death - “Not today.”
1894,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn’t my horse.
1895,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, She’s doing well.
1896,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, She’ll never keep it down.
1897,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Tell me what she is saying.
1898,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, “The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him… and their wives will weep tears of blood.”
1899,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, She’s going to have a boy.
1900,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, He won’t be a real Targaryen. He won’t be a true dragon.
1901,JORA,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," “The stallion who mounts the world.” The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd."
1902,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!
1903,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, They love her.
1904,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, She truly is a queen today.
1905,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Don’t let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.
1906,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, It’s not my law.
1907,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, They don’t belong to you.
1908,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Whatever is hers is also mine.
1909,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Once, perhaps."
1910,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," If I sell one egg, I’ll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs - a ship and an army."
1911,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, And you have all three.
1912,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," I need a large army… I’m the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it… How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don’t think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don’t think I know what you want? I don’t care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go."
1913,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," You can go, but you can’t have the eggs."
1914,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
1915,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, It means everything to me.
1916,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, And yet here you stand?
1917,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, And here I stand.
1918,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
1919,MORD,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Noise again!
1920,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, About the gold -
1921,MORD,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, No gold!
1922,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine."
1923,MORD,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Where?
1924,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Where? I don’t know where, but when they free me -"
1925,MORD,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You want free? Go be free. (points out of the skycell)
1926,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You’re a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do."
1927,MORD,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, What message?
1928,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
1929,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You wish to confess your crimes?
1930,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Yes, my lady. I do, my lady."
1931,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man."
1932,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I’m a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I’m not particularly good at violence, but I’m good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle’s boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"
1933,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Silence!
1934,ROBIN ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,What happened next?!
1935,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, What do you think you’re doing?
1936,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Confessing my crimes.
1937,CATELYN STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister’s husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King."
1938,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Oh, I’m very sorry. I don’t know anything about all that."
1939,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," You’ve had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor."
1940,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King’s Justice? I’m accused and demand a trial."
1941,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," If you’re tried and found guilty, then by the king’s own laws you will pay with your life."
1942,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I understand the law.
1943,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.
1944,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other."
1945,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
1946,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You have that right.
1947,KNIGHT 1,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion."
1948,KNIGHT 2,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.
1949,KNIGHT 3,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," I’ll fight for you, my Lady."
1950,KNIGHT 4,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, It’ll be my honor.
1951,KNIGHT 5,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, The honor should be mine.
1952,ROBIN ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Make the bad man fly!
1953,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Ser Vardis… You’re quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?
1954,SER VARDIS,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice."
1955,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Agreed.
1956,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You demanded a trial by combat.
1957,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you."
1958,SER VARDIS,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp’s champion for you."
1959,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," I wouldn’t be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister."
1960,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
1961,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Send a raven for him, I’m happy to wait."
1962,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, The trial will be today.
1963,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Do I have a volunteer?
1964,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Anyone?... Anyone?
1965,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I think that we can assume that no one is willing -
1966,BRONN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I’ll stand for the dwarf.
1967,LANCEL LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," More wine, your Grace?"
1968,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Oh, what was I saying?"
1969,RENLY BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, A simpler time.
1970,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," It was! It was. You’re too young to remember. Wasn’t it, Selmy?"
1971,BARRISTON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," It was, your Grace."
1972,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today."
1973,RENLY BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Sounds exhilarating.
1974,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. (laughs) You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?"
1975,RENLY BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Once, I think."
1976,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," You think? I think you’d remember. Back in our day, you weren’t a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”"
1977,RENLY BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Those were some lucky girls.
1978,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," You ever make the eight, Barristan?"
1979,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," I don’t believe so, your Grace."
1980,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, (laughs) Those were the days!
1981,RENLY BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?"
1982,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you’re speaking to the King."
1983,RENLY BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”
1984,LANCEL LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," More wine, your Grace?"
1985,MAN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took ‘em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire."
1986,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Brigands, most likely."
1987,MAN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," They weren’t thieves, they didn’t steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace."
1988,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," It’s the King’s Hand you’re addressing, not the king. The king is hunting."
1989,PETYR BAELISH,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Fish. The sigil of House Tully. (whispers to Ned) Isn’t that your wife’s House - Tully - my Lord Hand?
1990,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,"  These men, were they flying a sigil? … A banner."
1991,MAN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," None, your… Hand. The one who was leading them… Taller by a foot than any man I’ve ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword."
1992,PETYR BAELISH,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, (whisper) That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
1993,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  You’re describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
1994,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
1995,PETYR BAELISH,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I’ve heard him called “Tywin Lannister’s mad dog.” I’m sure you have as well. (whispering to Ned) Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
1996,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king’s protection, it would be -"
1997,PETYR BAELISH,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
1998,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Wel…
1999,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,"  I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion."
2000,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor’s keep.
2001,BERIC DONDARRION,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, As you command.
2002,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,"  In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king’s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death."
2003,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, My lord… This… This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert’s return.
2004,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  Grand Maester Pycelle.
2005,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, My Lord.
2006,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,"  Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm."
2007,PETYR BAELISH,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion’s tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers."
2008,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
2009,ROBIN ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Is it over?
2010,LYSA ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You don’t fight with honor!
2011,BRONN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, No. He did.
2012,ROBIN ARRYN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Can I make the little man fly now?
2013,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.
2014,TYRION LANNISTER,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, A Lannister always pays his debts.
2015,MORDANE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
2016,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Well, why shouldn’t I? We’re in the south."
2017,MORDANE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, It’s important to remember where you come from. I’m not sure your mother would like these new styles.
2018,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, My mother isn’t from the North.
2019,MORDANE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I’m aware of that.
2020,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
2021,MORDANE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Yes. I have hair.
2022,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I’ve never seen it.
2023,MORDANE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Would you like to?
2024,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?"
2025,MORDANE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I come from a very small village in -
2026,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Oh, wait. I just realized… I don’t care."
2027,MORDANE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Sansa -
2028,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Septa.
2029,MORDANE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Now you are being rude.
2030,MORDANE,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, My prince.
2031,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, My prince.
2032,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?
2033,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, It’s beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.
2034,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,"  You’ll be queen one day, it’s only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?"
2035,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, There’s nothing to forgive.
2036,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," You’re my lady. One day we’ll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south. And you will be queen over all of them.  I’ll never disrespect you again. I’ll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You’re my lady now, from this day, until my last day."
2037,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!
2038,ROS,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Going to King’s Landing.
2039,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, In a turnip cart?
2040,ROS,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I’ll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
2041,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, And you can afford that?
2042,ROS,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Some of my friends are more generous than others.
2043,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, There’s a thousand girls like you in King’s Landing.
2044,ROS,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I’ll have lots of company…
2045,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Yes, you’ll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can’t get it up so he knocks all your teeth out."
2046,ROS,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," (laughs) And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?"
2047,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Don’t be a fool.
2048,ROS,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King’s Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back, there’s nothing more for me here. Let’s go, Steffon."
2049,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Let me see it one more time?
2050,ROS,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, See what?
2051,THEON GREYJOY,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I’m going to miss you!
2052,ROS,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, I know.
2053,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  I’m sending you both back to Winterfell.
2054,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, What?!
2055,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  Listen -
2056,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, What about Joffrey?
2057,ARYA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you’re sending us home?
2058,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  What? No.
2059,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Please, Father. Please don’t."
2060,ARYA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  You can’t. I’ve got my lessons with Syrio. I’m finally getting good.
2061,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  This isn’t a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
2062,ARYA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  Can’t we take Syrio back with us?
2063,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can’t go. I’m supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I’m meant to be his queen and have his babies.
2064,ARYA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Seven hells.
2065,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,"  When you’re old enough, I’ll make you a match with someone who’s worthy of you, someone who’s brave and gentle and strong -"
2066,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," I don’t want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! He’ll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I’ll give him sons with beautiful blond hair."
2067,ARYA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," The lion’s not his sigil, idiot. He’s a stag, like his father."
2068,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, He is not. He’s nothing like that old drunk king.
2069,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,"  Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things."
2070,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Wait!
2071,ARYA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  Come on! (dragging Sansa)
2072,SANSA STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, It’s not fair!
2073,EDDARD STARK,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,"  “Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.” “Axel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Steffon Baratheon, black of hair.” “Robert Baratheon, black of hair.” “Joffrey Baratheon… golden-haired.”"
2074,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Daenerys! Where’s my sister?
2075,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Stop him.
2076,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Where is she? I’m here for the feast. The whore’s feast.
2077,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Come.
2078,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Get your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!
2079,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Khal Drogo! I’m here for the feast.
2080,KHAL DROGO,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," (speaks Dothraki, motions to the other side of the hut)"
2081,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.
2082,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, That is no place for a king.
2083,KHAL DROGO,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  You are no king.
2084,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Keep away from me!
2085,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," Viserys, please."
2086,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, There she is.
2087,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Put the sword down. They’ll kill us all.
2088,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," They can’t kill us. They can’t shed blood in their sacred city. (moving his sword over everyone in the room, stopping on Daenerys’ stomach) But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you."
2089,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Tell him I want what was bargained for or I’m taking you back. He can keep the baby. I’ll cut it out and leave it for him.
2090,KHAL DROGO,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34,  (speaks Dothraki)
2091,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, What’s he saying?
2092,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold."
2093,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, That was all I wanted. W-what was promised.
2094,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh!
2095,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Look away Khaleesi.
2096,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, No.
2097,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34," No. Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can’t!"
2098,VISERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Dany please!
2099,KHAL DROGO,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, A crown for a king.
2100,JORAH MORMONT,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, Khaleesi…
2101,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_34, He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.
2102,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Attacking him was stupid.
2103,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Lannisters don't act like fools.
2104,JAIME LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Catelyn Stark took my brother.
2105,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Why is he still alive?
2106,JAIME LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Tyrion?
2107,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Ned Stark.
2108,JAIME LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him."
2109,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Why is he still alive?
2110,JAIME LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  It wouldn't have been clean.
2111,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Clean...
2112,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
2113,JAIME LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
2114,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Now that's what you want people to think of you.
2115,JAIME LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  It's the truth.
2116,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36," When you hear them whispering ""Kingslayer"" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?"
2117,JAIME LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Of course it bothers me.
2118,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
2119,JAIME LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
2120,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us."
2121,JAIME LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..
2122,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!"
2123,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Hmm.
2124,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You're in pain.
2125,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  I've had worse, my lady."
2126,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Perhaps it's time to go home.
2127,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  The South doesn't seem to agree with you.
2128,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.
2129,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?"
2130,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Has he done this before?
2131,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Jaime would have killed him.
2132,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
2133,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Your brother Or your lover?
2134,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.
2135,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.  We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.
2136,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  My son saw you with him.
2137,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Do you love your children?
2138,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  With all my heart.
2139,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  No more than I love mine.
2140,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  And they are all Jaime's.
2141,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Thank the Gods.
2142,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You've always hated him.
2143,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Hated him? I worshiped him.
2144,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth."
2145,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself."
2146,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them."
2147,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Oh, but it was."
2148,ROS,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Come here.
2149,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you-- wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?"
2150,ROS,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Yes, My Lord."
2151,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman."
2152,ROS,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Why don't you join us, My Lord?"
2153,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I'm saving myself for another.
2154,ROS,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  What she doesn't know won't hurt her.
2155,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  A stupid saying.
2156,ROS,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  She must be very beautiful.
2157,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though."
2158,ROS,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I do believe my lord's in love.
2159,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  For many years. Most of my life really.
2160,ROS,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Is she still married to him?
2161,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding.
2162,ROS,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  And what do you want?
2163,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is."
2164,THEON GREYJOY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?
2165,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Where is it you come from?
2166,THEON GREYJOY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  The Iron Islands.
2167,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  They far away?
2168,THEON GREYJOY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You've never heard of the Iron Islands?
2169,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither."
2170,THEON GREYJOY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Trust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore."
2171,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  And what's that?
2172,THEON GREYJOY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Lord.
2173,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Why?
2174,THEON GREYJOY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands."
2175,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?"
2176,THEON GREYJOY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I will be lord after my father.
2177,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  So you're not lord now?
2178,THEON GREYJOY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  No, you...You having a go at me? Is that it?"
2179,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.
2180,THEON GREYJOY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I'm not a Southerner.
2181,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.
2182,THEON GREYJOY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?"
2183,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Couldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what ""impunent"" means."
2184,THEON GREYJOY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.
2185,MAESTER LUWIN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.
2186,THEON GREYJOY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I thought she was our prisoner.
2187,MAESTER LUWIN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
2188,MAESTER LUWIN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
2189,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I'm used to worse than him.
2190,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
2191,MAESTER LUWIN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Why did you come here?
2192,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this.
2193,MAESTER LUWIN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,   Why? What are you afraid of?
2194,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
2195,MAESTER LUWIN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,   Owls and Shadowcats and...
2196,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.
2197,MAESTER LUWIN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"   The ""things"" you speak of-- they've been gone for thousands of years."
2198,OSHA,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  They wasn't gone, old man. They was sleeping."
2199,SAMWELL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I miss girls.
2200,JON SNOW,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Why is he alone?
2201,SAMWELL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three for..."
2202,JON SNOW,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  There's no rider.
2203,NIGHT WATCH STABLE BOY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Whoa, boy, whoa."
2204,JON SNOW,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.
2205,RENLY BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Ned! It's Robert.
2206,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man."
2207,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust."
2208,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Robert, my sweet..."
2209,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Out, all of you!"
2210,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You damned fool.
2211,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say."
2212,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Give it to the council after I'm dead.
2213,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I will.
2214,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  And my son Help him, Ned. Make him better than me."
2215,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  I'll, I'll do everything I can to honor your memory."
2216,ROBERT BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  My memory.
2217,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Give him milk of the poppy.
2218,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  He was reeling from the wine.
2219,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  No man could have protected him from himself.
2220,LORD VARYS,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?"
2221,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  His squire, from the king's own skin."
2222,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  His squire? The Lannister boy?
2223,LORD VARYS,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.
2224,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.
2225,LORD VARYS,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I'm afraid those birds have flown.
2226,KHAL DROGO,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  The stallion who mounts the world, has no need for iron chairs."
2227,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world."
2228,KHAL DROGO,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  The earth ends at the black salt sea. No horse can cross the poison water.
2229,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea."
2230,KHAL DROGO,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Not dirt. Lands.
2231,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Lands, yes..."
2232,KHAL DROGO,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
2233,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  It's not a chair. It's a... Throne
2234,KHAL DROGO,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Throne?
2235,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen."
2236,KHAL DROGO,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  A King does not need a chair to sit upon. He only needs a horse.
2237,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Can't you help me make him understand?
2238,JORAH MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons."
2239,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms."
2240,JORAH MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right."
2241,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  And because he had dragons.
2242,JORAH MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier."
2243,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You don't believe it.
2244,JORAH MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report."
2245,DEANERYS TARGARIAN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36," Well, I'll come with you."
2246,JORAH MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  No no, don't trouble yourself. Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough."
2247,LITTLE BIRD,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Psst, Jorah the Andal."
2248,WINE MERCHANT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Virzetha gizikhven! Mra qora! Mra qora!
2249,WINE MERCHANT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  A taste for the Khaleesi? I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady."
2250,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine."
2251,WINE MERCHANT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  My Lady, you are from Westeros."
2252,DOREAH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen.
2253,WINE MERCHANT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Princess.
2254,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.
2255,WINE MERCHANT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  That? Dornish swill.
2256,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  You honor me, Ser."
2257,WINE MERCHANT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  The honor...the honor is all mine.
2258,RAKHARO,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Huh-uh, huh-uh."
2259,WINE MERCHANT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess."
2260,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I hope to repay your kindness someday.
2261,JORAH MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Rakharo.
2262,RAKHARO,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Huh.
2263,JORAH MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Put down that cask.
2264,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Is something wrong?
2265,JORAH MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I have a thirst. Open it.
2266,WINE MERCHANT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.
2267,JORAH MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Open it.
2268,JORAH MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Pour.
2269,WINE MERCHANT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.
2270,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Do as he says.
2271,WINE MERCHANT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  As the princess commands.
2272,WINE MERCHANT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord."
2273,JORAH MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You first.
2274,WINE MERCHANT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
2275,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You will drink.
2276,DOREAH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Khaleesi! Stop him!
2277,JORAH MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Come.
2278,JEOR MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  You came to us as outlaws, poachers, rapers, killers, thieves."
2279,SAMWEL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You're allowed to look happy.
2280,JON SNOW,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I want to find my Uncle.
2281,SAMWELL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  I wish I could help you, but I'm no Ranger."
2282,SAMWELL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  There's honor in being a steward.
2283,JEOR MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Here you begin anew.
2284,JON SNOW,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  I do, my lord."
2285,JEOR MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.
2286,JON SNOW,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Yes, my lord."
2287,JEOR MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall. And your old Gods too, maybe."
2288,SAMWELL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  my lord, might I go as well?"
2289,JEOR MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?
2290,SAMWELL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  No, my lord."
2291,SAMWELL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  The Night's Watch is my house now.
2292,JEOR MORMONT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  As you wish, lad."
2293,JAREMY RYKKER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Rangers with me.
2294,OTHELL YARWYCK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Builders!
2295,MAESTER AEMON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library."
2296,JON SNOW,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.
2297,MAESTER AEMON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers.
2298,JON SNOW,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Do you take me for a servant?
2299,MAESTER AEMON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.
2300,JON SNOW,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  May I go?
2301,MAESTER AEMON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  As you wish.
2302,SAMWELL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?"
2303,JON SNOW,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all."
2304,PYPAR,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.
2305,SAMWELL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
2306,PYPAR,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
2307,SAMWELL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song."
2308,SAMWELL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.
2309,JON SNOW,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger."
2310,SAMWELL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I always wanted to be a Wizard.
2311,RENLY BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Lord Stark, a moment."
2312,RENLY BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  He named you Protector of the Realm.He did.
2313,RENLY BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  She won't care.
2314,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  And what should I do with a hundred swords?
2315,RENLY BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.
2316,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  What about Stannis?
2317,RENLY BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?
2318,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Stannis is your older brother.
2319,RENLY BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  This isn't about the bloody line of succession.
2320,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice.
2321,RENLY BARATHEON,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert."
2322,TELL ME SOMETHING,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36, Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
2323,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
2324,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You will sail to dragonstone tonight.
2325,TOMARD,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Yes, My Lord."
2326,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Now leave us.
2327,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  My Lord protector.
2328,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  The King has no true born sons.
2329,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  So when the King dies...
2330,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.
2331,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  So it would seem. Unless...
2332,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  There is no ""unless""."
2333,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  And he cannot take the throne without your help.
2334,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Do you have a shred of honor?
2335,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
2336,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  We?
2337,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest."
2338,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  What you suggest is treason.
2339,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Only if we lose.
2340,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy."
2341,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  We only make peace with our enemies, my Lord."
2342,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  No. I won't do it.
2343,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  So it will be Stannis and war?
2344,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  There is no other choice. He is the heir.
2345,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly."
2346,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You promised Catelyn you would help me.
2347,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Look at you. You know what you want me to do.
2348,BOTH JON AND SAM,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Hear my words and bear witness to my vow.
2349,OTHELL YARWYCK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You knelt as boys.
2350,FELLOW NIGHT'S WATCH BROTHERS,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Well done. Well done.
2351,SAMWELL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  What's he got there?
2352,SAMWELL TARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Gods be good!
2353,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  What will they do to him?
2354,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  And when he falls?
2355,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  King Robert still wants me dead.This poisoner was the first. He won't be the last.
2356,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone."
2357,DAENERYS STORMBORN,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  He will not have my son.
2358,KHAL DROGO,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Moon of my life. Are you hurt?
2359,KHAL DROGO,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did."
2360,MESSENGER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Lord Stark!
2361,VARLY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Stop!
2362,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  No, all right."
2363,MESSENGER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the Throne Room."
2364,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  King Joffrey?
2365,MESSENGER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  King Robert is gone.
2366,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  All is accomplished. The City Watch is yours.
2367,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Good. Is Lord Renly joining us?
2368,LORD VARYS,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I fear Lord Renly has left the city.
2369,JANOS SLYNT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  We stand behind you, Lord Stark."
2370,MESSENGER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  All hail his Grace, Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the first of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
2371,KING JOFFREY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation.
2372,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Ser Barristan, I believe no man here could ever question your honor."
2373,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  King Robert's seal. Unbroken.
2374,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?"
2375,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Those were the King's words.
2376,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  We have a new King now.
2377,KING JOFFREY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Liar!
2378,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark."
2379,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm."
2380,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  You think he stands alone?
2381,KING JOFFREY,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,"  Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!"
2382,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody.
2383,JANOS SLYNT,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Men of the Watch!
2384,NED STARK,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I want no bloodshed.
2385,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  Now!
2386,PETYR BAELISH,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_36,  I did warn you not to trust me.1Embed
2387,SYRIO FOREL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Right low, lunge right."
2388,STEWARD OF HOUSE STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  If you break anything, the Septa will have my head. What is..."
2389,SEPTA MORDANE,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
2390,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.
2391,SEPTA MORDANE,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Hush! Go back to your room.
2392,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  What is it? What's happening?
2393,SEPTA MORDANE,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Do as I told you. Run!
2394,SYRIO FOREL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  This way! Left, right."
2395,ARYA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  You said right, but you went left."
2396,SYRIO FOREL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  And now you are a dead girl.
2397,ARYA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Only 'cause you lied.
2398,SYRIO FOREL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  My tongue lied.
2399,ARYA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  I was so. I watched, but you..."
2400,SYRIO FOREL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Watching is not seeing, dead girl."
2401,MERYN TRANT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Arya Stark, come with us."
2402,SYRIO FOREL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? I am wondering.
2403,MERYN TRANT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Mind your place, dancing master."
2404,ARYA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  My father wouldn't send you.
2405,ARYA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
2406,MARYN TRANT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Take her.
2407,SYRIO FOREL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?"
2408,KINGS GUARD,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Get out of my way, little man."
2409,SYRIO FOREL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I am Syrio Forel.
2410,KINGS GUARD,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Foreign bastard.
2411,SYRIO FOREL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
2412,MERYN TRANT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.
2413,SYRIO FOREL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day."
2414,MERYN TRANT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Bloody oafs.
2415,SYRIO FOREL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Be gone now, Arya."
2416,ARYA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Come with me. Run.
2417,SYRIO FOREL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The first sword of Braavos does not run.
2418,SYRIO FOREL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  What do we say to the God of death?
2419,ARYA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Not today.
2420,SYRIO FOREL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Go.
2421,ARYA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Not today. Not today.
2422,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Stay away from me.
2423,SANDOR CLEGANE,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Who do you think sent me?
2424,ARYA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Needle.
2425,STABLE BOY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  There she is.
2426,ARYA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  What do you want?
2427,STABLE BOY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  I want you, wolf girl. Come here."
2428,ARYA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
2429,STABLE BOY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  She'll reward me, the Queen!"
2430,ARYA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Stay away!
2431,LORD VARYS,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Lord Stark, you must be thirsty."
2432,NED STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Varys.
2433,LORD VARYS,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I promise you it isn't poisoned.
2434,NED STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  What about my daughters?
2435,LORD VARYS,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
2436,NED STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  And Sansa?
2437,LORD VARYS,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Still engaged to Joffrey.
2438,NED STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
2439,LORD VARYS,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  And would again, My Lord."
2440,NED STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The madness of mercy. That she might save her children.
2441,LORD VARYS,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Ah, the children. It is always the innocents who suffer."
2442,NED STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The Queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother.
2443,LORD VARYS,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The wrong brother sadly.
2444,NED STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it."
2445,LORD VARYS,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Not today, My Lord."
2446,NED STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Tell me something, Varys."
2447,LORD VARYS,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  The Realm, My Lord."
2448,JEOR MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  It's Othor, without a doubt."
2449,OTHELL YARWYCK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off."
2450,JEOR MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
2451,JON SNOW,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say."
2452,JEOR MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Mmm.
2453,SAMWELL TARLY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The smell.
2454,OTHELL YARWYCK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  What smell?
2455,SAMWELL TARLY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  There is none.
2456,JON SNOW,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  We should burn them.
2457,OTHELL YARWYCK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Snow's not wrong, My Lord."
2458,JEOR MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
2459,OTHELL YARWYCK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  You heard him.
2460,SER ALLISER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38," Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers. A raven from King's Landing."
2461,NIGHTS WATCH BROTHER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Come on, move 'em out."
2462,JEOR MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself."
2463,JON SNOW,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Is there any word of my father?
2464,JEOR MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Sit.
2465,JEOR MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
2466,JON SNOW,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  My sisters were in King's Landing too.
2467,JEOR MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
2468,LORD VARYS,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear."
2469,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
2470,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  He wouldn't do that. He knows how much I love Joffrey.
2471,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong."
2472,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
2473,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  No, I'm not."
2474,PETYR BAELISH,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  The girl is innocent, Your Grace."
2475,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest."
2476,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Robb.
2477,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt."
2478,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  If...if I could see my father, talk to him about..."
2479,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  You disappoint me, child."
2480,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I only meant that...what will happen to him?
2481,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  That depends.
2482,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  On...on what?
2483,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  On your brother. And on you.Back at Winterfell, Robb reads the letter Sansa sent."
2484,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Treason? Sansa wrote this?
2485,MAESTER LUWIN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words."
2486,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?"
2487,MAESTER LUWIN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38," This is a royal command, My Lord."
2488,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  I won't refuse. His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing."
2489,MAESTER LUWIN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38," All of them, My Lord?"
2490,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?"
2491,MAESTER LUWIN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38, They have.
2492,MAESTER LUWIN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38, Yeah.
2493,THEON GREYJOY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Are you afraid?
2494,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I must be.
2495,THEON GREYJOY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Good.
2496,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Why is that good?
2497,THEON GREYJOY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  It means you're not stupid.
2498,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  You've had this since dawn?
2499,LYSA ARRYN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  He sent it to me, not you."
2500,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  A courtesy?! My husband has been taken prisoner.
2501,LYSA ARRYN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  A war? Your son against the Lannisters?
2502,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience? He is your brother by law!Does family mean nothing to you?
2503,LYSA ARRYN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Family means everything to me.
2504,ROBIN ARRYN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I'm hungry.
2505,LYSA ARRYN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Hush now, darling. You just ate."
2506,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?
2507,ROBIN ARRYN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  But I'm hungry!
2508,LYSA ARRYN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Soon, love, soon."
2509,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  That is what I ask.
2510,LYSA ARRYN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Go on, sweet. Time for your bath. I'll feed you after."
2511,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  If you fear for the safety of your son...
2512,LYSA ARRYN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
2513,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  And that is why we have to stop them.
2514,LYSA ARRYN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord."
2515,BRONN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Will you shut up? There's hill tribes all around here.
2516,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart."
2517,BRONN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I should just take your food and leave you here.
2518,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Starve, most likely."
2519,BRONN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  You don't think I'd do it, do you?"
2520,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women? Golden women?"
2521,BRONN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Fair enough.
2522,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Though I would treasure your friendship.
2523,REMEMBER THIS,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38," Whatever their price, I'll beat it."
2524,BRONN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion.
2525,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Come, share our fire."
2526,SHAGGA,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  When you meet your Gods, you tell them Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you."
2527,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
2528,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock."
2529,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  No no no no no! My, my House is rich and powerful."
2530,SHAGGA,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  We have no use for a half man's promises.
2531,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies."
2532,SHAGGA,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
2533,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
2534,SHAGGA,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  What is ""this""?"
2535,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The Vale of Arryn.
2536,SER ALLISER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Now there's a rare sight. Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard."
2537,SAMWELL TARLY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Jon, no! Jon, stop, put it down!"
2538,SER ALLISER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Blood will always tell. You'll hang for this, bastard."
2539,JEOR MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I told you not to do anything stupid. You're confined to quarters. Go.
2540,JON SNOW,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Ghost, what's wrong? Is something out there?"
2541,JON SNOW,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Commander?
2542,JON SNOW,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Stay.
2543,JON SNOW,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Hello?
2544,JEOR MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Snow!?
2545,JON SNOW,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Commander!Othor gets back on his feet, pulling out Jon's sword out of his chest. Outside of the room, Ghost goes beserk, trying to get in."
2546,JON SNOW,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Move move!
2547,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  What did they do?
2548,RAKHARO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Lamb men make good slaves. Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers.
2549,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
2550,JORAH MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Gold to hire ships, Princess. Ships to sail to Westeros."
2551,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Jorah, make them stop."
2552,JORAH MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Khaleesi?
2553,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  You heard me.
2554,JORAH MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  These men have shed blood for their Khal.
2555,RAKHARO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi. The riders do her honor."
2556,JORAH MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been."
2557,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  I do not have a gentle heart, Ser. Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why."
2558,RHAKHARO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Kash qoy qoyi thira disse. Me qorasokh anni!
2559,JORAH MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Come.

2561,JORAH MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  What do you want done with them?
2562,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Bring her to me. And those women there.
2563,JORAH MORMONT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  You cannot claim them all, Princess."
2564,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  I can, and I will."
2565,MAGO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Me Fati! Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni, ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!"
2566,KHAL DROGO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Me vastoe hatif anni; ahhazaan yer Nemo vacchaki.
2567,KHAL DROGO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Moon of my life. Mago says you have taken his spoils.
2568,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars. I have claimed many daughters this day, so they cannot be mounted."
2569,KHAL DROGO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  This is the way of war. These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
2570,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  It pleases me to keep them safe.
2571,QOTHO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Does the horse mate with the lamb?
2572,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The dragons feeds on horse and lamb alike.
2573,MAGO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  You are a foreigner. You do not command me.
2574,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I am Khaleesi. I do command you.
2575,KHAL DROGO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  See how fierce she grows?
2576,MAGO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
2577,KHAL DROGO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Ohosa. Os.
2578,KHAL DROGO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The beetles will feed on your eyes. The worms will crawl through your lungs.
2579,KHAL DROGO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The rain will fall on your rotting skin...
2580,KHAL DROGO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Until nothing is left of you but bones!
2581,MAGO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  First you have to kill me!
2582,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  My sun and stars is wounded.
2583,KHAL DROGO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  A scratch, moon of my life."
2584,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Where are the healers?
2585,KHAL DROGO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  This is the bite of a fly.
2586,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I can help the great rider with his cut.
2587,QOTHO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
2588,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  She is mine let her speak.
2589,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Thank you, silver lady."
2590,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Who are you?
2591,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
2592,QOTHO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  A witch.
2593,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  My mother was Godswife here before me.
2594,QOTHO,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Too many words. A witch's words poison the ears.
2595,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester."
2596,DAENARYS STORMBORN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars."
2597,GREATJON UMBER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy."
2598,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Galbart Glover will lead the Van.
2599,GREATJON UMBER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
2600,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber."
2601,GREATJON UMBER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Oathbreaker, is it?!"
2602,GREATJON UMBER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
2603,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord.
2604,GREATJON UMBER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Your meat...is bloody tough.
2605,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  What is it? What's happened?
2606,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Shh, it's all right."
2607,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Where are you going?
2608,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  South. For father.
2609,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  But it's the middle of the night.
2610,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
2611,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  They have more men than we do.
2612,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Aye, they do."
2613,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Can't I come with you? I can ride now. You've seen me riding.
2614,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
2615,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I will.
2616,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared."
2617,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  How long have you been hiding out there?
2618,RICKON STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  They've all gone away.
2619,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  They'll be back soon.
2620,RICKON STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  No, they won't."
2621,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Please watch over Robb.
2622,OSHA,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  You hear them, boy? The Old Gods are answering you."
2623,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  What are you doing here?
2624,OSHA,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  They're my Gods too.
2625,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  You're not a slave.
2626,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat."
2627,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
2628,OSHA,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  You asked them, they're answering you."
2629,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  It's only the wind.
2630,OSHA,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Well, there's a big man."
2631,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Go back and find your clothes, Hodor."
2632,HODOR,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Hodor.
2633,BRANN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
2634,OSHA,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Giants and worse than giants.
2635,SAMWELL TARLY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  They were touched by White Walkers.
2636,JON SNOW,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  How do you know that?
2637,SAMWELL TARLY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I read about it in a book. A very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
2638,JON SNOW,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  What else did the book say?
2639,SAMWELL TARLY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
2640,PYPAR,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  And when they wake up, what?"
2641,SAMWELL TARLY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I hope The Wall is high enough.
2642,RODRIK CASSEL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Summer snows, My Lady."
2643,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Robb's brought the North with him.
2644,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
2645,GREATJON UMBER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts ten times this large."
2646,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Mother!
2647,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  You look well.
2648,GREATJON UMBER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times."
2649,THEON GREYJOY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady."
2650,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I had not thought to be here.
2651,GREATJON UMBER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  You heard her! Move your asses! Come on, out."
2652,RODRIK CASSEL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Jon.
2653,GREATJON UMBER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  You're not wasting away, are you?"
2654,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.
2655,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  There was no one else.
2656,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  No one? Who were those men I saw here?
2657,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  None of them are Starks.
2658,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  All of them are seasoned in battle.
2659,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
2660,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Oh, would that I could."
2661,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  There was a letter. From Sansa.
2662,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  From the Queen, you mean."
2663,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  No.
2664,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  How many men do you have?
2665,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  18,000. If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey..."
2666,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  you would never be allowed to leave. No.
2667,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  And if I lose?
2668,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children, when the Mad King fell?"
2669,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  They were butchered in their sleep.
2670,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  On the orders of Tywin Lannister. And the years have not made him kinder.
2671,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Well, that makes it simple then."
2672,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I suppose it does.
2673,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
2674,SHAGGA,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Best for Tyrion son of Tywin. Not best for me.
2675,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  And feed it to the goats, yes."
2676,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Uncle. Father.
2677,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
2678,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Sorry to disappoint you.
2679,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  And who are these Companions of yours?
2680,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  This is Shagga Son of Dolf, Chieftain of the Stone Crows."
2681,BRONN,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  You wouldn't know him.
2682,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister."
2683,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake.
2684,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  We have our differences, Jaime and I."
2685,JAMIE LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  He's been covering himself in glory.
2686,KEVAN LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland."
2687,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
2688,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Is our hostage.
2689,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
2690,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Robert Baratheon is dead.
2691,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  My sister rules, you mean."
2692,KEVAN LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Stark's son has called his banners.
2693,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  A green boy.
2694,TYRION LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
2695,MESSENGER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  If it please My Lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck."
2696,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
2697,KEVAN LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  At once, My Lord."
2698,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.
2699,SHAGGA,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Only if the half man fights with us.
2700,RODRIK CASSAL,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
2701,GREATJON UMBER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun."
2702,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
2703,THEON GREYJOY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Lord Frey controls that bridge.
2704,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  ""The late Lord Frey"" my father calls him."
2705,THEON GREYJOY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Robb's right.
2706,GREATJON UMBER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  So what's it gonna be? Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
2707,STARK GUARD,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Your pardon, my lords."
2708,GREATJON UMBER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Don't worry, lad."
2709,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Where did you find him?
2710,STARK GUARD,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  In the brush above the encampment.
2711,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  How high did you get?
2712,LANNISTER SCOUT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  20,000. Maybe more."
2713,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  My father understands mercy, when there is room for it."
2714,CATELYN STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Robb.
2715,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Tell Lord Tywin, Winter is coming for him."
2716,LANNISTER SCOUT,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Yes, My Lord. Thank you, My Lord."
2717,GREATJON UMBER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?"
2718,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  You call me boy again.
2719,ROBB STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Go on.
2720,GREATJON UMBER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Oi.
2721,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  It is also the wish of His Grace, that his loyal servant Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch..."
2722,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Ser Aron.
2723,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Be at once raised to the rank of Lord.
2724,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Lord Gyles.
2725,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him, until the end of time."
2726,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Ser Barristan Selmy.
2727,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Your Grace, I am yours to command."
2728,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Rise, Ser Barristan."
2729,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood."
2730,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?"
2731,KING JOFFREY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  You let my father die.
2732,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Your Grace...
2733,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
2734,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
2735,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Careful, Ser."
2736,LORD VARYS,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser."
2737,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  A hall to die in and men to bury me.
2738,PETYR BAELISH,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  A naked Knight, apparently."
2739,BARRISTAN SELMY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
2740,KING'S LANDING PAGE,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence."
2741,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Your Grace.
2742,KING JOFFREY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Come forward, My Lady."
2743,KING'S LANDING PAGE,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
2744,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?"
2745,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  I do.
2746,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King."
2747,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Treason is a noxious weed.
2748,KING JOFFREY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Let her speak.
2749,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  Thank you, Your Grace."
2750,PETYR BAELISH,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Do you deny your father's crime?
2751,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  No, My Lords. I know he must be punished."
2752,KING JOFFREY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  He said I wasn't the King. Why did he say that?
2753,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  He was badly hurt.
2754,LORD VARYS,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  A child's faith Such sweet innocence.
2755,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Treason is treason!
2756,KING JOFFREY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Anything else?
2757,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,"  If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace."
2758,KING JOFFREY,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  Your sweet words have moved me.
2759,SANSA STARK,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_38,  He will.1Embed
2760,EDDARD STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Another visit? lt seems you're my last friend.
2761,VARYS,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  No, no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life."
2762,EDDARD STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  On her knees begging for me. Hm! Did you laugh with the others?
2763,VARYS,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want."
2764,EDDARD STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  l don't know what you want. l've given up trying to guess.
2765,VARYS,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  When l was still a boy - before they cut my balls off with a hot knife - l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. l am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. l'm a good actor, my lord."
2766,EDDARD STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Huh. Can you free me from this pit?
2767,VARYS,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero."
2768,EDDARD STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?"
2769,VARYS,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.
2770,EDDARD STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Robb? He's just a boy.
2771,VARYS,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
2772,EDDARD STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.
2773,VARYS,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
2774,EDDARD STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?"
2775,VARYS,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son."
2776,EDDARD STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.
2777,VARYS,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?"
2778,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
2779,THEON GREYJOY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
2780,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
2781,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
2782,GREATJON UMBER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
2783,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
2784,THEON GREYJOY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
2785,GREATJON UMBER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
2786,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll."
2787,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Have my horse saddled and ready.
2788,GREATJON UMBER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
2789,THEON GREYJOY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
2790,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me."
2791,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  l agree. l'll go.
2792,EVERYONE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  You can't!
2793,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.
2794,GREATJON UMBER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Unless there was a profit in it.
2795,WALDER FREY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  What do you want?
2796,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord."
2797,WALDER FREY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?"
2798,STEVRON FREY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is –"
2799,WALDER FREY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?"
2800,RYGER RIVERS,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Father, please –"
2801,WALDER FREY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly."
2802,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  ls there somewhere we can talk?
2803,WALDER FREY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!
2804,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  l'm sure she will give you many sons.
2805,WALDER FREY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
2806,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  He is quite ill, my lord."
2807,WALDER FREY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me."
2808,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  My lord, l –"
2809,WALDER FREY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
2810,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  l'm sure there were reasons –
2811,WALDER FREY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
2812,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way."
2813,WALDER FREY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Why should l let him?
2814,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls."
2815,WALDER FREY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm."
2816,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  You swore an oath to my father.
2817,WALDER FREY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters."
2818,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Why don't you?
2819,WALDER FREY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?"
2820,VOICES OUTSIDE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  And engage!
2821,JEOR MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
2822,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Soon, he says."
2823,JEOR MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think."
2824,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  This is Valyrian steel.
2825,JEOR MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros."
2826,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  My lord, you honor me, but l can't –"
2827,JEOR MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?"
2828,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Yes, my lord."
2829,JEOR MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it."
2830,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
2831,JEOR MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist – l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper."
2832,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Yes, my lord."
2833,UNIDENTIFIED NIGHT’S WATCHERS,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Well done. Well done.
2834,NIGHT’S WATCHER #1,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  You earned that, Snow."
2835,NIGHT’S WATCHER #2,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Well done.
2836,PYP,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Go on, let's have a look."
2837,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  At what?
2838,GRENN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  The sword! Show us the sword.
2839,ALL,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
2840,PYP,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Let's have a look.
2841,GRENN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Piss off.
2842,PYP,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!"
2843,GRENN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Look at its eyes.
2844,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  What is it?
2845,SAMWELL TARLY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  l - l can't.
2846,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  You can't what?
2847,SAMWELL TARLY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  l'm really not supposed to say.
2848,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  And yet you really want to say. You want to say that…
2849,SAMWELL TARLY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
2850,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  What? What about him?
2851,SAMWELL TARLY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe."
2852,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  l should be there. l should be with him.
2853,GREATJON UMBER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  lf we do that, they'll never get back across."
2854,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Well? What did he say?
2855,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well."
2856,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Huh.
2857,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
2858,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  What does he want in return?
2859,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
2860,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"   Fine, fine. And?"
2861,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
2862,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  She won't be happy about that. And?
2863,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.
2864,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
2865,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  l did.
2866,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  And?
2867,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  One was – Do you consent?
2868,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Can l refuse?
2869,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Not if you want to cross.
2870,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Then l consent.
2871,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Sam said you wanted to see me?
2872,MAESTER AEMON,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?"
2873,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  No.
2874,MAESTER AEMON,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?"
2875,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  He would do whatever was right, no matter what."
2876,MAESTER AEMON,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?"
2877,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Sam told you.
2878,MAESTER AEMON,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose."
2879,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
2880,MAESTER AEMON,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know."
2881,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother."
2882,MAESTER AEMON,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South
2883,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  Who are you?
2884,MAESTER AEMON,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,"  My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King."
2885,JON SNOW,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_40,  You're Aemon Targaryen.
2886,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo.
2887,KHAL DROGO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) My horse…
2888,COHOLLO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) Blood of my blood…
2889,KHAL DROGO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  (in Dothraki) No, l must ride."
2890,QOTHO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
2891,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  (in Dothraki) He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here."
2892,QOTHO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
2893,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
2894,QOTHO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  (in Dothraki) You do not command me, Khaleesi."
2895,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
2896,QOTHO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  (in Dothraki) The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi."
2897,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
2898,QOTHO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) Hyah! Hyah!
2899,KEVAN LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
2900,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage."
2901,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt."
2902,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them."
2903,KEVAN LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided."
2904,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Shagga likes axes.
2905,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard."
2906,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
2907,KEVAN LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  They do seem rather ferocious.
2908,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."
2909,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander."
2910,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
2911,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
2912,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords."
2913,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
2914,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  l took her.
2915,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Took her? From whom?
2916,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down."
2917,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  And he didn't have anything to say about it?
2918,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  He said something.
2919,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow."
2920,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one."
2921,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Who are you?
2922,PROSTITUTE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Who would you like me to be?
2923,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  What did your mother call you?
2924,PROSTITUTE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Shae. What did your mother call you?
2925,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  My mother died giving birth to me.
2926,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
2927,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  What sort of accent is that?
2928,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Foreign.
2929,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  For-
2930,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  What do you want from me?
2931,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."
2932,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  And what do l get?
2933,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular."
2934,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Who told you this? Women you paid?
2935,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
2936,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Let's start with your last night in this world.
2937,JORAH MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42, Khaleesi.
2938,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
2939,JORAH MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  He will die tonight, Khaleesi."
2940,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  He can't. He can't. l won't let him.
2941,JORAH MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
2942,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  l won't leave him.
2943,JORAH MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  He's already gone, Khaleesi."
2944,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo."
2945,JORAH MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs."
2946,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  l won't leave him.
2947,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  The wound has festered.
2948,QOTHO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  (in Dothraki) You did this, witch. (pulls a dagger out of its sheath)"
2949,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) Stop it! l don't want her hurt.
2950,QOTHO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  (in Dothraki) No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal."
2951,JORAH MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
2952,QOTHO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  (in Dothraki) Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing."
2953,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.
2954,QOTHO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  (in Dothraki) The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi."
2955,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser."
2956,JORAH MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  l think you're right.
2957,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  You've saved me once more.
2958,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  And now you must save him.
2959,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.
2960,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.
2961,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
2962,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Do it. Save him.
2963,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  There is a price.
2964,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"   You'll have gold, whatever you want."
2965,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.
2966,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  My death?
2967,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse."
2968,RAKHARO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch."
2969,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,   Kill her and you kill your khal.
2970,RAKHARO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.
2971,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.
2972,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Go. Now.
2973,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Take her and leave. Take her!
2974,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight."
2975,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  No one will enter.
2976,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Bring him back to me.
2977,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  l have to save him.
2978,QOTHO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) This must not be.
2979,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) This must be.
2980,QOTHO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) Witch.
2981,RAKHARO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  (in Dothraki) Nothing good will come of this.
2982,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  (in Dothraki) No, you can't."
2983,IRRI,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Khaleesi!
2984,JORAH MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  (in Dothraki) No further, horselord."
2985,JORAH MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Are you hurt?
2986,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42, The baby –
2987,JORAH MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Hmm?
2988,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42, … is coming.
2989,JORAH MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Fetch the midwives.
2990,RAKHARO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  They will not come. They say she is cursed.
2991,JORAH MORMONT,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  They'll come or l'll have their heads.
2992,RAKHARO,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.
2993,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Are you in agony, my lion?"
2994,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  No.
2995,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
2996,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?"
2997,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Just used to it.
2998,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,   Drink.
2999,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Let's play a new game.
3000,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
3001,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
3002,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Not if you win.
3003,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."
3004,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  What are you good at?
3005,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  l happen to be a great judge of character.
3006,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  This sounds like a boring game.
3007,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying."
3008,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  l don't want to play this game.
3009,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
3010,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  But my mother hit harder.
3011,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  You killed your first man before you were 12.
3012,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  lt was a woman. (Tyrion drinks. Shae looks at Bronn, surprised.) She swung an axe at me."
3013,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  You've been north of the Wall.
3014,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  What brought you up there?
3015,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Work.
3016,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. (Tyrion drinks) Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."
3017,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  l don't want to play.
3018,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
3019,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Drink.
3020,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
3021,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Drink.
3022,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  And we've established the rules about lying?
3023,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Drink!
3024,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
3025,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
3026,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
3027,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Drink.
3028,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Are you sure –
3029,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head."
3030,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize."
3031,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  My turn.
3032,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
3033,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Who were you in love with?
3034,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  That's not how the game works.
3035,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  l don't care the way the game works.
3036,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Our lord here used to be married.
3037,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Married?
3038,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  How did you hear that?
3039,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
3040,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Another night, perhaps."
3041,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Not another night. This night.
3042,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  lt's not a pleasant story.
3043,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Oh, maybe l will cry."
3044,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
3045,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
3046,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  For three chickens, l should hope so."
3047,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
3048,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."
3049,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
3050,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  l would have killed the man who did that to me.
3051,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  You should have known she was a whore.
3052,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."
3053,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
3054,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  As l said, l was young and stupid."
3055,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  You are still young and stupid.
3056,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  What is it? What do you want?
3057,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  You're sleeping through the war.
3058,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  What?
3059,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
3060,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Get my squire!
3061,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  You don't have a squire.
3062,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  lf l die, weep for me."
3063,SHAE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  You'll be dead. How will you know?
3064,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  l'll know.
3065,LANNISTER SOLDIER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42, Watch out! Move!
3066,LANNISTER SOLDIER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42, Out of the way! Move aside!
3067,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Stay low.
3068,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Stay low?
3069,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  lf you're lucky, no one will notice you."
3070,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!"
3071,TRIBESMEN OF THE VALE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42, Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!
3072,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  To battle!
3073,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  You're a shit warrior.
3074,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  l'm alive?
3075,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  You're alive.
3076,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Did we win?
3077,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
3078,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  How did our tribesmen do?
3079,BRONN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Yeah, good."
3080,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  lt's nice to see them getting along.
3081,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  You're wounded.
3082,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Good of you to notice. l hear we won.
3083,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand]."
3084,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Did we get the Stark boy, at least?"
3085,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  He wasn't here.
3086,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Where was he?
3087,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  With his other 18,000 men."
3088,TYRION LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  And where are they?
3089,RODRIK CASSEL,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  We should go, my lady."
3090,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  No!
3091,RODRIK CASSEL,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  My lady!
3092,STARK BANNERMEN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Hyah! Hyah!
3093,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened."
3094,JAIME LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it."
3095,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
3096,JAIME LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  l've lost them too, l'm afraid."
3097,THEON GREYJOY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him."
3098,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  He's more use to us alive than dead.
3099,CATELYN STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Take him away and put him in irons.
3100,JAIME LANNISTER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now."
3101,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way."
3102,GREATJON UMBER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Come on, pretty man."
3103,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  l sent 2,000 men to their graves today."
3104,THEON GREYJOY,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
3105,ROBB STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Aye. But the dead won't hear them. (making a speech to his bannermen) One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
3106,ARYA STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.
3107,KING’S LANDING BAKER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Three coppers.
3108,ARYA STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  How about a nice fat pigeon?
3109,KING’S LANDING BAKER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Oh, piss off now. Go on."
3110,ARYA STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
3111,KING’S LANDING BAKER,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Piss off!
3112,ARYA STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?"
3113,STREET URCHIN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
3114,ARYA STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Who?
3115,STREET URCHIN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  The Hand of the King.
3116,POPULACE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Traitor! Coward!
3117,EDDARK STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Baelor!
3118,POPULACE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Traitor! Traitor!
3119,EDDARK STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say"
3120,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?"
3121,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!"
3122,SANSA STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  No, stop! Please, someone stop him!"
3123,CERSEI BARATHEON,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42," My son, this is madness."
3124,POPULACE,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42, Put him down!
3125,YOREN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42, Don't look!
3126,ARYA STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Let me go.
3127,YOREN,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,  Shut your mouth. Look at me.
3128,SANSA STARK,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_42,"  Stop him, stop!"
3129,YOREN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Keep your mouth shut, boy. (takes out a knife)"
3130,ARYA STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l'm not a boy!
3131,YOREN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? Do you want to live, boy?! (starts cutting Arya’s hair as the screams and shouts from the crowd are heard above) North, boy, we're going north."
3132,BRAN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  lt had three eyes. lt told me to come with him, so l did. We went down into the crypts and my father was there."
3133,OSHA,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Your father's not down there, little lord. Not for many years yet."
3134,BRAN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  You're afraid. Just like Hodor.
3135,OSHA,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.
3136,BRAN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of? l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go.
3137,BRAN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard. He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys. That's Lyanna, my father's sister. King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. Robert started a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. That's where l saw Father."
3138,OSHA,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  You see? He's not here.
3139,RICKON STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Here, Shaggydog."
3140,BRAN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Rickon!
3141,OSHA,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!
3142,RICKON STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  He doesn't like chains.
3143,BRAN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  What are you doing down here? Come back up with us.
3144,RICKON STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  No, l came to see Father."
3145,BRAN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  How many times have l told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.
3146,RICKON STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  He was down here. l saw him.
3147,BRAN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Saw him when?
3148,RICKON STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Last night, when l was sleeping. Here, Shaggydog."
3149,OSHA,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  You both miss him. lt's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that –"
3150,MAESTER LUWIN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Bran…
3151,SEVERAL STARK BANNERMEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  My lady. My lady. My lady.
3152,CATELYN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Robb. Robb! You've ruined your sword.
3153,CATELYN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Shh! Shh! Shh!
3154,ROBB STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l'll kill them all. Every one of them. l will kill them all.
3155,CATELYN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  My boy. They have your sisters. We have to get the girls back. And then we will kill them all.
3156,MARILLION,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  (singing)
3157,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Very amusing. lsn't it a funny song? Thank you for your rendition. l imagine it was even better received at that tavern.
3158,MARILLION,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  l'm so sorry, Your Grace. l'll never sing it again, l swear."
3159,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Tell me, which do you favor - your fingers or your tongue?"
3160,MARILLION,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Your Grace?
3161,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Fingers or your tongue? lf you got to keep one, which would it be? Or l could just cut your throat."
3162,MARILLION,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Every man needs hands, Your Grace."
3163,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Good. Tongue it is.
3164,MARILLION,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Your Grace, please. l won't sing, Your Grace."
3165,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Ser llyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?"
3166,MARILLION,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  l beg you! Please, no. No!"
3167,MARILLION,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Your Grace, please. l beg you, l will never sing again! (screaming) No!"
3168,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  l'm done for the day. l'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother."
3169,MARILLION,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  (screaming) Your Grace, please!"
3170,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  You look quite nice.
3171,SANSA STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Thank you, my lord."
3172,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Your Grace. l'm King now.
3173,MARILLION,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  (screaming) Stop! No!
3174,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Walk with me. l want to show you something.
3175,SANDOR CLEGANE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Do as you're bid, child."
3176,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  And as soon as you've had your blood, l'll put a son in you. Mother says that shouldn't be long."
3177,SANSA STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  No! Please, no!"
3178,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  (pointing at one of the heads) This one's your father. This one here. Look at it and see what happens to traitors.
3179,SANSA STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  You promised to be merciful.
3180,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l was. l gave him a clean death. Look at him.
3181,SANSA STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Please let me go home. l won't do any treason, l swear –"
3182,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Mother says l'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here, and obey. Look at him!"
3183,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Well?
3184,SANSA STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  How long do l have to look?
3185,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  As long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest?
3186,SANSA STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  lf it please Your Grace.
3187,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  That's your Septa there. (shot of the impaled head of a woman with the traditional Septa headscarf) l'll tell you what, l'm going to give you a present. After l raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, l'm going to give you his head as well."
3188,SANSA STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Or maybe he'll give me yours. (looks defiantly at Joffrey, who cowers)"
3189,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  My mother tells me a king should never strike his lady. Ser Meryn.Ser Meryn strikes Sansa repeatedly with the back of his (armoured) hand, leaving her lip bloodied. Sansa notices the stone bridge Joffrey is on leads to a street some feet below. She moves forward to lunge him from the edge, but she’s stopped by the Hound."
3190,SANDOR CLEGANE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Here, girl. (cleans her bloody lip with a rag)"
3191,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? l'll look for you in court.
3192,SANDOR CLEGANE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Save yourself some pain, girl. Give him what he wants."
3193,SANDOR CLEGANE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  You'll be needing that again.
3194,JONOS BRACKEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.
3195,ROBB STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Renly is not the king.
3196,JONOS BRACKEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord. He put your father to death."
3197,ROBB STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis."
3198,JONOS BRACKEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
3199,GALBART GLOVER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis…
3200,GREATJON UMBER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  My Lords. My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North! (The Greatjon bows to Robb with his sword unsheathed; Robb rises)"
3201,RICKARD KARSTARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. (bows to Robb and extends him his sword) The King in the North!
3202,THEON GREYJOY,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Am l your brother, now and always?"
3203,ROBB STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Now and always.
3204,THEON GREYJOY,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  (takes out his sword, bows to Robb) My sword is yours in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day."
3205,GREATJON UMBER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  The King in the North!
3206,ALL,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  (chanting)  The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
3207,ALL,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  (chanting)  The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
3208,STARK GUARD,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Lady Stark.
3209,CATELYN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l want to see him. Now! Leave us.
3210,CATELYN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Leave us. (the guards leave)
3211,JAIME LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. (Catelyn grabs a large rock from the ground)  Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. (She marches towards him and hits the rock against his forehead)   Oh, l do like a violent woman."
3212,CATELYN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  l will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister."
3213,JAIME LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Let me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long."
3214,CATELYN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death."
3215,JAIME LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?"
3216,CATELYN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just."
3217,JAIME LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
3218,CATELYN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Because of men like you.
3219,JAIME LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  There are no men like me. Only me.
3220,CATELYN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?
3221,JAIME LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l pushed him out the window.
3222,CATELYN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Why?
3223,JAIME LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  I hoped the fall would kill him.
3224,CATELYN STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Why?
3225,JAIME LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war. (Catelyn drops the rock and goes away)
3226,LANCEL LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?"
3227,CERSEI LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Stop talking. Get back into bed.
3228,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  They have my son.
3229,TYRION LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
3230,LEO LEFFORD,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.
3231,ADDAM MARBRAND,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  ls it true about Stannis and Renly?
3232,KEVAN LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace."
3233,TYRION LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.
3234,KEVAN LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l'm told we still have his sisters.
3235,LEO LEFFORD,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.
3236,ADDAM MARBRAND,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44, Kevan Lannister
3237,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  (shouting)  They have my son! Get out, all of you. (to Tyrion) Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong."
3238,TYRION LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here."
3239,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
3240,TYRION LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  And do what?
3241,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…"
3242,TYRION LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?"
3243,TYWIN LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?"
3244,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Ser Jorah?
3245,JORAH MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Gently, gently."
3246,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  My son – where is he? l want him. Where is he?
3247,JORAH MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  The boy did not live.
3248,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Tell me.
3249,JORAH MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  What is there to tell?
3250,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  How did my son die?
3251,JORAH MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  He never lived, my princess. The women say –"
3252,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  What do the women say?
3253,JORAH MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  They say the child was –
3254,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  (entering the tent) Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price."
3255,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.
3256,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him."
3257,JORAH MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Time enough for that later –
3258,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l want to see him now.
3259,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  The khalasar is gone.
3260,JORAH MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess."
3261,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Drogo! (in Dothraki) My sun and stars. (in the Common Tongue, to the rest) Why is he out here alone?"
3262,JORAH MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  He seems to like the warmth, Princess."
3263,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life."
3264,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  (looking at Drogo’s catatonic expression) This is not life. When will he be as he was?
3265,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves."
3266,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Leave us.
3267,JORAH MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l don't want you alone with this sorceress.
3268,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.
3269,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  You knew what l was buying and you knew the price.
3270,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  lt was wrong of them to burn my temple. lt angered the Great Shepherd.
3271,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  This is not God's work. My child was innocent.
3272,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.
3273,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l spoke for you. l saved you.
3274,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my god's house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?"
3275,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Your life.
3276,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Why don't you take a look at your khal. Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.
3277,SAMWELL TARLY,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  You can't!
3278,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Get out of my way, Sam."
3279,SAMWELL TARLY,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?
3280,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Better than you do.
3281,SAMWELL TARLY,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  What are you going to do?
3282,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat. (gets on horseback)
3283,SAMWELL TARLY,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  You can't leave us now. We need you here.
3284,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Move.
3285,SAMWELL TARLY,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l won't let you go.
3286,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Move.
3287,SAMWELL TARLY,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  No.
3288,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Hyah!
3289,SHAE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Hand of the King?
3290,TYRION LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  So it would seem.
3291,SHAE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?
3292,TYRION LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  No, he said l couldn't take  you with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point."
3293,SHAE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  He knew my name?
3294,TYRION LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  What?
3295,SHAE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  He said, ""Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing""?"
3296,TYRION LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  l believe he used the word ""whore""."
3297,SHAE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out?
3298,SHAE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  I’m funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore."
3299,TYRION LANNISTER,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand – (Shae kisses Tyrion)"
3300,SHAE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l know what a Hand needs.
3301,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Ghost?
3302,"SAM, PYP, AND GRENN",1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
3303,GRENN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Samwell!
3304,PYP,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  ls he dead?
3305,GRENN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  No, he's not dead."
3306,SAMWELL TARLY,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Did we get him?
3307,GRENN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Come on, help me get him up."
3308,PYP,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Lucky you've got plenty of padding. (to Jon)  We're taking you back to where you belong.
3309,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l belong with my brother.
3310,SAMWELL TARLY,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,   But we're your brothers now.
3311,GRENN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.
3312,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.
3313,PYP,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Sam told us everything. We're sorry about your father.
3314,GRENN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.
3315,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l have to.
3316,GRENN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  You can't. You said the words.
3317,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  I don't care about –
3318,SAMWELL TARLY,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  ""Hear my words and bear witness to my vow"""
3319,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  To hell with all of you.
3320,PYP,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  ""Night gathers and now my watch begins. lt shall not end until my death. l shall live and die at my post."
3321,GRENN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  ""l am the sword in the darkness – """
3322,"SAM, PYP, AND GRENN",1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  (in unison, reciting the vow) ""l am the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realms of men. l pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.”"
3323,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  (in Dothraki) Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars."
3324,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  (crying)  When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars."
3325,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is – For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign."
3326,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"   He is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. Mmm. True greatness."
3327,ROS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  So what's the thing?
3328,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  What thing?
3329,ROS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  About kings. You said, ""The thing you need to understand about kings""."
3330,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  What? Things? What?
3331,ROS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  When you started, you… Never mind."
3332,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Let me see you out, my dear."
3333,ROS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  lt's all right. No need.
3334,GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Yes, yes. Till the next time. (Pycelle gets off the bed and stretches his limbs with ease, belying his old age and general sickly demeanor) Right."
3335,VARYS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?"
3336,PETYR BAELISH,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
3337,VARYS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  A man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.
3338,PETYR BAELISH,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?"
3339,VARYS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
3340,PETYR BAELISH,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
3341,VARYS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Oh, you can do better than that."
3342,PETYR BAELISH,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered."
3343,VARYS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
3344,PETYR BAELISH,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?
3345,VARYS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all."
3346,PETYR BAELISH,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Must be strange for you, even after all these years… a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all."
3347,VARYS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
3348,PETYR BAELISH,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.
3349,VARYS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women."
3350,PETYR BAELISH,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree."
3351,VARYS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.
3352,PETYR BAELISH,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Playing our roles.
3353,VARYS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  (Joffrey arrives, Varys bows)  Serving a new King."
3354,PETYR BAELISH,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Long may he reign. My king. (bows)
3355,VARYS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  My king.
3356,JOFFREY BARATHEON,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  My lords. Shall we begin?
3357,YOREN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions, ‘cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?"
3358,ARYA STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Arry.
3359,YOREN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  You've a long way to travel, and in bad company. l've 20 this time –  men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot – half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself – and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three."
3360,HOT PIE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Watch yourself, midget."
3361,LOMMY GREENHANDS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  He's got a sword, this one."
3362,HOT PIE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?
3363,LOMMY GREENHANDS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Maybe he's a little squire.
3364,HOT PIE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword.
3365,LOMMY GREENHANDS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Let's have a look. (wrestles Arya to the ground)
3366,HOT PIE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l could use me a sword like that.
3367,LOMMY GREENHANDS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Take it off him.
3368,HOT PIE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Give it here, midget."
3369,LOMMY GREENHANDS,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Look at him! You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. l've seen him kick a boy to death.
3370,HOT PIE,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead. l kicked him all to pieces. You better give me that sword!
3371,ARYA STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  (pointing Needle at Hot Pie) You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.
3372,GENDRY,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Your like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? (Hot Pie leaves, scared. Gendry talks to Arya alone) This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?"
3373,ARYA STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  lt was a gift.
3374,GENDRY,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  lt don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen, murderers."
3375,ARYA STARK,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Which are you?
3376,GENDRY,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Armourer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here l am."
3377,YOREN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  (shouting) Come on, you sorry sons of whores! lt's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall, and winter is coming!"
3378,JEOR MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring?
3379,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  My friends brought me back.
3380,JEOR MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l didn't say it was your honor.
3381,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  They killed my father.
3382,JEOR MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  And you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?"
3383,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  No.
3384,JEOR MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne?"
3385,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  No.
3386,JEOR MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Good. Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.
3387,JON SNOW,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Beyond the Wall?
3388,JEOR MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?"
3389,RAKHARO,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  (picking up the dragon eggs from their chest, speaking in Dothraki) ls this your command, Khaleesi? (Daenerys nods, Rakharo places the eggs next to Drogo’s funeral pyre)"
3390,JORAH MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
3391,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  They were not given to me to sell.
3392,JORAH MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Khaleesi, my Queen, l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. l know what you intend. Do not."
3393,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  l must. You don't understand.
3394,JORAH MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn.
3395,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  ls that what you fear? (kisses Jorah on the cheek, then speaks to the rest of the Dothraki and Lhazareen who stayed with her)  You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives."
3396,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,"  Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me."
3397,MIRRI MAZ DUUR,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  You will not hear me scream.
3398,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life.
3399,JORAH MORMONT,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_44,  (bowing)  Blood of my blood.
3400,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," (Quietly) Well struck… (Louder) Well struck, Dog."
3401,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Did you like that?
3402,SANSA,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," It was well struck, Your Grace."
3403,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, I already said it was well struck.
3404,SANSA,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Yes, Your Grace."
3405,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Who's next?
3406,ANNOUNCER,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Lothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish."
3407,ANNOUNCER,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.
3408,ANNOUNCER,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, (Yells) Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!
3409,SER DONTOS,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Here I am. (Walking down some stairs, awkwardly clutching his helmet and weapon).  Here I am. (Drops his helmet). Sorry, Your Grace. (Puts his helmet on backwards). My deepest apologies. (Puts his helmet on correctly)."
3410,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Are you drunk?
3411,SER DONTOS,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," No. Uh, no, Your Grace. I had - I had two cups of wine."
3412,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Two cups? (Dontos nods). That's not much at all. (Joffrey gestures to some wine). Please, have another cup."
3413,SER DONTOS,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Are you sure, Your Grace?"
3414,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Yes, to celebrate my name day. (Smiles) Have two, have as much as you like."
3415,SER DONTOS,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," I would be honored, Your Grace."
3416,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day. See that he drinks his fill."
3417,SANSA,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, You can't!
3418,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, What did you say? Did you say I can't?
3419,SANSA,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, I only meant… it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
3420,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...
3421,THE HOUND,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," The girl is right. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year."
3422,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," (Sighs). Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool."
3423,SANSA,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, He is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.
3424,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? (Ser Dontos is forced onto his feet). From this day, (Standing up), you'll be my new fool."
3425,SER DONTOS,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Thank you, Your Grace. (Bows). And you, My Lady, thank you."
3426,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Beloved nephew.
3427,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, We looked for you on the battlefield. (Joffrey sits down). You were nowhere to be found.
3428,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," I've been here, ruling the kingdoms."
3429,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," What a fine job you've done. (Turns to Myrcella). Look at you. (Kisses her). More beautiful than ever. (Turns to Tommen). And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. (Tyrion smiles. He and Myrcella laugh). This one doesn't like me."
3430,BRONN,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Can't imagine why.
3431,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, We heard you were dead.
3432,MYRCELLA,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, I'm glad you're not dead.
3433,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. (Looks at Sansa). My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss."
3434,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!
3435,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.
3436,SANSA,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey."
3437,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Of course you are.
3438,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Well, (Gulps down his wine), enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done."
3439,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, What work? (Bronn and the tribesmen follow Tyrion. Joffrey stands up). Why are you here?
3440,PYCELLE,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, (The man sets the cage down and removes the cover), considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last. The longest summer in living memory."
3441,VARYS,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter."
3442,PYCELLE,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, A common superstition.
3443,BAELISH,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, (Shrugs indifferently), we'll have fewer peasants."
3444,JANOS,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, it'll only get worse."
3445,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?"
3446,JANOS,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," I do, Your Grace."
3447,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, And are you not a Lord at my command?
3448,JANOS,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace."
3449,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital."
3450,JANOS,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Yes, Your Grace."
3451,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. (Kisses Cersei on the cheek). War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on."
3452,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, What are you doing here?
3453,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," (Sits down) It's been a remarkable journey. I, (grabs a glass), pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. (Pours himself wine). I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for."
3454,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, What are you doing here? This is the small council.
3455,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings."
3456,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Our father is Hand of the King.
3457,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Yes, but in his absence…"
3458,VARYS,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -
3459,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Out! All of you out. (The small council members all get up and leave until it is only Cersei and Tyrion. Cersei stands up and approaches Tyrion). I would like to know how you tricked father into this.
3460,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. (Cersei sits down)."
3461,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, I've done nothing.
3462,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
3463,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, I tried to stop it.
3464,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
3465,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Robb Stark is a child.
3466,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
3467,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, What do you know about warfare?
3468,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
3469,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Joffrey is King.
3470,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, Joffrey is King.
3471,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, You are here to advise him.
3472,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back."
3473,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, How?
3474,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
3475,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, One.
3476,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45, One?
3477,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Arya, little animal, she disappeared."
3478,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_45," Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child."
3479,LORD,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1," My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons."
3480,LORD,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1," The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall."
3481,LUWIN,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.
3482,LORD,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1," Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war."
3483,BRAN,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.
3484,LORD,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1," Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men."
3485,BRAN,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1," Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?"
3486,LORD,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, Of course I remember!
3487,LUWIN,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1," We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?"
3488,LORD,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, I - I believe it will.
3489,LUWIN,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1," We didn't want him here all day, did we?"
3490,BRAN,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
3491,LUWIN,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. (Bran sighs). Lord Portan.
3492,PORTAN,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1," (Walks forward). My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons."
3493,OSHA,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away.
3494,BRAN,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, Don't have any pain.
3495,OSHA,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, Lucky for you.
3496,BRAN,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, That way.
3497,OSHA,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, You've been having those dreams again.
3498,BRAN,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, I don't dream.
3499,OSHA,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, Everyone dreams.
3500,BRAN,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. (Bran looks up at the comet). They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
3501,OSHA,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1," Did they? (Hodor is kneeling next to the pool in the godswood. Osha begins unstrapping Bran from Hodor’s back). I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father."
3502,OSHA,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1," The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons."
3503,BRAN,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1, The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries.
3504,DOREAH,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1," What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?"
3505,DAENERYS,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1, He said they ate meat.
3506,DOREAH,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1, He didn't tell you what kind of meat?
3507,DAENERYS,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1, My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.
3508,DAENERYS,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1, She was Drogo's first gift to me.
3509,JORAH,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1, I remember.
3510,DAENERYS,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1, I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?
3511,JORAH,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1," A trick I never learned, I'm afraid."
3512,DAENERYS,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1, Does it ever end?
3513,JORAH,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1," This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste."
3514,DAENERYS,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1, And you're sure there's no other way?
3515,JORAH,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1," If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons."
3516,DAENERYS,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1, No one will take my dragons.
3517,JORAH,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1," They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength."
3518,DAENERYS,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1, (Turns to Jorah) As you are mine.
3519,DAENERYS,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1," (Speaking Dothraki) Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast."
3520,RAKHARO,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1," (Speaking Dothraki) What do we seek, Khaleesi?"
3521,DAENERYS,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1," (Speaking Dothraki) Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."
3522,DAENERYS,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1," (Speaking Dothraki) Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood."
3523,RAKHARO,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1," (Speaking Dothraki) I will not fail you, blood of my blood."
3524,DAENERYS,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1, You never have.
3525,RAKHARO,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1, This is… bad time to start.
3526,JON,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, Having a rough time of it?
3527,SAM,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, Nothing's killed me yet.
3528,GRENN,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, Your ass killed the sledge.
3529,SAM,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, You offered me a ride!
3530,GRENN,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.
3531,EDD,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," I was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times."
3532,SAM,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, Are those girls?
3533,EDD,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, Craster's daughters.
3534,SAM,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, I haven't seen a girl in six months.
3535,EDD,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.
3536,GRENN,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?"
3537,EDD,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, (Smirking) He don't like people messing with his wives.
3538,EDD,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters, and on, and on it goes."
3539,SAM,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, That's foul.
3540,GRENN,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, It's beyond foul.
3541,EDD,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.
3542,JON,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, What happens to the boys?
3543,SAM,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, Hmm?
3544,JON,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?
3545,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.
3546,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. (Sips his wine). Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that."
3547,JON,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, (Standing off to the side of the room) We're not Southerners.
3548,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?
3549,JON,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, Jon Snow.
3550,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North."
3551,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, The lad meant no harm.
3552,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters -
3553,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. (Turns to Jon) Now, sit down and shut your mouth."
3554,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, You bring any of that good wine with you?
3555,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?
3556,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," I could tell you, but I'm thirsty."
3557,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge. Bring it in here.
3558,WATCHMAN,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," Yes, commander."
3559,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, You want to know where they've all gone? North! To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend.
3560,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers!"
3561,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," Oh, aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall."
3562,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, He's been calling himself that for years. What’s he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?
3563,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?
3564,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, Give it here.
3565,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, You'll have another one made at Castle Black. (Hands the axe to Craster). Here.
3566,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," (Inspecting the axe). Oh, that's some lovely steel. (Loudly brings the axe down). You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army. What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your southern kings."
3567,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, And where does he plan marching this army?
3568,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go."
3569,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, These are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.
3570,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," Let them come. My roots are sunk deep. (Grabs Gilly) Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are."
3571,GILLY,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, This is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave.
3572,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?"
3573,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, We chose different paths.
3574,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. (Stands up).  You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs."
3575,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, (Stands up) A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you.
3576,CRASTER,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," (Addressing the group). Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one, (Gestures towards Jon),  staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out."
3577,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1," Your roof, your rules."
3578,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, (Angrily) Who am I? (Jon looks confused) Who am I?
3579,JON,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, Lord commander.
3580,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, And who are you?
3581,JON,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, Jon Snow.
3582,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, Who are you?
3583,JON,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, Your steward.
3584,LORD MORMONT,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1, You want to lead one day? (Jon nods). Then learn how to follow.
3585,MELISANDRE,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false Gods."
3586,MELISANDRE,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors.
3587,THE GROUP,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, (In unison) For the night is dark and full of terrors.
3588,MELISANDRE,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world. Stars will bleed."
3589,CRESSEN,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, (To Davos) We need to stop her!
3590,MELISANDRE,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas.
3591,DAVOS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, (Looks to Stannis) Not now.
3592,MELISANDRE,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, And the dead shall rise in the North.
3593,CRESSEN,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," (Walks forward, interrupting Melisandre). All you men were named in the Light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?"
3594,MELISANDRE,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me."
3595,MELISANDRE,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you."
3596,CROWD,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," Lord, cast your light upon us!"
3597,MELISANDRE,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, For the night is dark and full of terrors.
3598,STANNIS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, For the night is dark and full of terror.
3599,CRESSEN,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.
3600,DAVOS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path."
3601,CRESSEN,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," (Scoffs) King. Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation."
3602,DAVOS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.
3603,CRESSEN,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos. (Davos picks up the sword and inspects it).  If you tell him the truth…"
3604,DAVOS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, What's the truth?
3605,MATTHOS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, “And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert le-”
3606,STANNIS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," He wasn't my beloved brother. (Matthos looks up). I didn't love him, he didn't love me."
3607,DAVOS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," A harmless courtesy, Your Grace."
3608,STANNIS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, A lie. Take it out.
3609,MATTHOS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," “That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs; the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella, being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth -"""
3610,STANNIS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Call him what he is."
3611,MATTHOS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," ""And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim -"""
3612,STANNIS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight."
3613,MATTHOS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," (Adding Ser) ""Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros. (Stannis nods). Let all true men declare their loyalty.”"
3614,STANNIS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse."
3615,DAVOS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -"
3616,STANNIS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.
3617,DAVOS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly."
3618,MELISANDRE,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him.
3619,DAVOS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
3620,MELISANDRE,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, He has no need for ships.
3621,DAVOS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark."
3622,STANNIS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them."
3623,CRESSEN,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," (Stands up). I owe you an apology, my King. My duty is to serve. You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods. May the Lord of Light watch over us all. Shall we drink together?"
3624,DAVOS,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, (Whispers to Cressen) Don't.
3625,CRESSEN,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1, A cup of wine to honor the one true God.
3626,MELISANDRE,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1," The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away. Your Grace."
3627,JAIME,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1," King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl."
3628,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1," If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, ""Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.”"
3629,JAIME,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1, You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
3630,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1," Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours."
3631,JAIME,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1, Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy’? Insulted?
3632,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1," You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy."
3633,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1, You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. (Grey Wind enters the cage. Jaime looks very nervous). Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. (Jaime focuses back on Robb). He's your bastard son.
3634,JAIME,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1," If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him."
3635,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1, My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.
3636,JAIME,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1, I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
3637,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1, Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.
3638,JAIME,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1, You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
3639,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1, I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
3640,JAIME,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1, You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
3641,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1," No, but he's starting to know me."
3642,JAIME,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1, Three victories don't make you a conqueror.
3643,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1, It's better than three defeats.
3644,SHAE,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, This city stinks Like dead bodies.
3645,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1," A bit corpsey, yes."
3646,SHAE,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, And shit.
3647,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, I thought you wanted to come here.
3648,SHAE,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, I love it.
3649,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
3650,SHAE,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, And cum and garlic and rum.
3651,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, You can smell cum from the balcony?
3652,SHAE,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.
3653,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, And so did the country.
3654,SHAE,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, This is where I belong.
3655,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1," Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here."
3656,SHAE,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, No one will know.
3657,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1," You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars."
3658,SHAE,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, What about you?
3659,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
3660,SHAE,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, Truth? (Laughs) You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.
3661,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1," Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, (Lays down on the bed with Shae), crushed beneath the weight of all that truth."
3662,TYRION,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1," Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here."
3663,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, Lord Baelish.
3664,BAELISH,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, Your Grace.
3665,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
3666,BAELISH,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1," Of course, Your Grace."
3667,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.
3668,BAELISH,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1," If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination."
3669,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
3670,BAELISH,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, Curious.
3671,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1," If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts."
3672,BAELISH,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1," Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. (Smiles) Who knows what they want?"
3673,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1," A mockingbird. (Points to a pin on Baelish’s shirt). You created your own Sigil, didn't you?"
3674,BAELISH,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, Yes.
3675,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
3676,BAELISH,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
3677,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1," I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another."
3678,BAELISH,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1," When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found."
3679,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, And which truth is that?
3680,BAELISH,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, Knowledge is power.
3681,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1, Seize him. (Cersei’s guards seize Baelish). Cut his throat. (A guard holds a knife to Baelish’s neck). Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. (The guards let Baelish go). Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. (The guards do as Cersei says). (To Baelish) Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.
3682,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, You're Ser Alton Lannister?
3683,ALTON,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," I am, Your Grace."
3684,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals."
3685,ALTON,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," An honorable request, Your Grace."
3686,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom."
3687,SER RODRIK,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, The King in the North.
3688,THE OTHERS AT THE TABLE,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, King in the North.
3689,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me."
3690,ALTON,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," These are... Your Grace, these are..."
3691,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead."
3692,ALTON,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace."
3693,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight."
3694,THEON,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," A word, Your Grace?"
3695,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace’ when no one's around.
3696,THEON,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, It's not so bad once you get used to it.
3697,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
3698,THEON,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?"
3699,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, Of course they are.
3700,THEON,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them."
3701,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, Men who fought my father.
3702,THEON,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together."
3703,CATELYN,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
3704,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, I need his ships. They say he has 200.
3705,CATELYN,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?
3706,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
3707,CATELYN,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
3708,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another."
3709,CATELYN,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten."
3710,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet."
3711,CATELYN,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?"
3712,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, It's more complicated than that! You know it is.
3713,CATELYN,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
3714,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, You can't go to Winterfell.
3715,CATELYN,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, I beg your pardon?
3716,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands."
3717,CATELYN,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, Why in the name of all the Gods -
3718,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family."
3719,CATELYN,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -
3720,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good."
3721,CATELYN,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, I will ride at first light.
3722,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3," We will all be together again soon, I promise."
3723,CATELYN,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, You've done so well. Your father would be proud.
3724,ROBB,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, (Pauses) Give Lord Renly my regards.
3725,CATELYN,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3, King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.
3726,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, What is all this?
3727,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3," Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers."
3728,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, We can't find Arya Stark.
3729,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3," With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere."
3730,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3," Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone."
3731,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. (Walks towards the throne).
3732,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
3733,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.
3734,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, His life is in danger.
3735,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.
3736,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
3737,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
3738,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
3739,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
3740,CERSEI,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, What are you asking?
3741,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -
3742,JOFFREY,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3," What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. (Joffrey begins to walk away). That will be all, Mother."
3743,ROZ,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3," No, no, no, no. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Ease into it. Slowly, with passion."
3744,ROZ,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on. Both of you are working tonight.
3745,ROZ,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3," We do things differently here, Daisy. This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall."
3746,DAISY,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Haystack Hall.
3747,ROZ,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Wherever you're from. Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders. (Nods to a man walking past). Lord Olsen. Taste is everything here.
3748,DAISY,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Littlefinger's a fancy man.
3749,ROZ,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3," Don't call him Littlefinger, he doesn't like it. Lord Baelish."
3750,ROZ,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.
3751,DAISY,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, She's beautiful.
3752,ROZ,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3," She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot. (Janos enters the room). Lord Commander. Good to see you, again."
3753,ROZ,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3," You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin. Coin which goes in many pockets."
3754,JANOS,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Orders.
3755,ROZ,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Whose orders?
3756,JANOS,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.
3757,MHAEGAN,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3," No, you can't!"
3758,MHAEGAN,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, No! Please! No! Not my Barra! Please. Please.
3759,JANOS,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Enough. Get it done. Kill the bastard.
3760,JANOS,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Give it here.
3761,GOLD CLOAK,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3," Spread out! Search every house, every room. Look in every room."
3762,BLACKSMITH,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Gendry! His name is Gendry.
3763,JANOS,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Where is the bastard?
3764,BLACKSMITH,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3," The Night's Watch! Please, stop!"
3765,JANOS,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Where?
3766,BLACKSMITH,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3," They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north!"
3767,JANOS,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, How will we know him?
3768,BLACKSMITH,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, He's got a bull's head helmet. He made it himself.
3769,JANOS,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3, Find him.
3770,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_46, What are you doing here?
3771,VARYS,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_46, Your father has named Lord Tyrion to (Cersei scoffs) serve as hand in his stead.
3772,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_46, You brought this on yourself.
3773,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_46, I’ve done nothing.
3774,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_46, Do you understand we’re losing the war?
3775,DAENERYS,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_46, Does it ever end?
3776,JORAH,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_46," Everything ends, even the red waste."
3777,DAENERYS,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_46," (Speaking Dothraki) Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.. Take our remaining horses. Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."
3778,EDD,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_46, All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster’s still here.
3779,CRASTER,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_46," Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand."
3780,EDD,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_46," He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters."
3781,MATTHOS,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48," (Reading a letter) My brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, the boy Joffrey being born of incest between Cersei Lannister, and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth, and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros."
3782,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm.
3783,ROBB,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, I’m sending one of your cousins down to King’s Landing with my peace terms.
3784,JAIME,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, You think my father’s going to negotiate with you? You don’t know him very well.
3785,THEON,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48," We won’t beat them until we take King’s Landing, and we can’t take King’s Landing without ships. My father has ships, and men who know how to sail them."
3786,ROBB,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, Men who fought my father.
3787,THEON,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, I’m his only living son. He’ll listen to me.
3788,CATELYN,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, You don’t want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
3789,ROBB,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, I need his ships.
3790,CATELYN,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, He is not trustworthy!
3791,JOFFREY,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, I heard a disgusting lie about uncle Jaime… and you. Father had other children?
3792,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, What are you asking?
3793,JOFFREY,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, How many bastards does he have running around?
3794,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, Where is the bastard?
3795,BLACKSMITH,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, The Night’s Watch! Heading North!
3796,JAQEN,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, (Whispers) Boy.
3797,JAQEN,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, (Whispers) Lovely boy.
3798,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, (Stops walking). What do you want?
3799,JAQEN,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, A man has a thirst. The man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend.
3800,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, (Walks toward the cave). I have friends.
3801,RORGE,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, Give us a beer. Before I skin you.
3802,JAQEN,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48," A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. (Pause). You're called Arry. (Arya nods).  This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar. Once of the Free City of Lorath."
3803,RORGE,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48," Hey, you little shit. Get us beer!"
3804,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, You should have asked nicely.
3805,RORGE,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, Come closer. And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.
3806,JAQEN,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, (Quietly) The boy has more courage than sense.
3807,RORGE,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, Come here!
3808,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.
3809,RORGE,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, Come here!
3810,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, They don't scare me.
3811,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me.
3812,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing?
3813,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, What are you doing?
3814,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, They're looking for me.
3815,GOLD CLOAK,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, You're in command here?
3816,YOREN,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, You're a long way from home.
3817,GOLD CLOAK,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, I asked you a question.
3818,YOREN,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48," Aye, you did. You asked without manners. And I chose not to answer."
3819,GOLD CLOAK,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, (Pulls out rolled up paper and hands it to Yoren). I have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
3820,YOREN,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48," Well the thing is, (Hands back the paper), these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens."
3821,YOREN,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48," It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it."
3822,YOREN,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.
3823,GOLD CLOAK,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_48, We're looking for a boy named Gendry. (Gendry and Arya look shocked). He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back. With more men. (To Yoren) And I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.
3824,VARYS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, My lord.
3825,SHAE,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company."
3826,VARYS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
3827,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, It was quite a battle.
3828,VARYS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
3829,SHAE,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, And I tell him the story of how we meet.
3830,VARYS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.
3831,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, (Begins to pour wine). Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
3832,SHAE,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
3833,VARYS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, How can you tell?
3834,SHAE,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, I can always tell.
3835,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. (Takes a sip).
3836,VARYS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends."
3837,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned."
3838,VARYS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. (Kisses Shae’s hand). Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord."
3839,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, I don't like threats.
3840,VARYS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, Who threatened you?
3841,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
3842,VARYS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, Ned Stark was a man of honor.
3843,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
3844,VARYS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting."
3845,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," “From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” (Rips up the letter). He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that."
3846,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith."
3847,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?"
3848,ALTON,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," I will, Your Grace."
3849,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?
3850,ALTON,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace."
3851,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten."
3852,ALTON,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," I will, Your Grace."
3853,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," Safe travels, cousin."
3854,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
3855,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, If that's everything?
3856,PYCELLE,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, (Holding a letter). A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.
3857,VARYS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, Trouble with the wildlings?
3858,BAELISH,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, That's why they're called wildlings.
3859,VARYS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
3860,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count."
3861,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
3862,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
3863,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them."
3864,PYCELLE,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, The northerners are a superstitious people.
3865,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. (The other stop leaving). Mormont doesn't lie."
3866,VARYS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, How do you kill a dead man?
3867,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, Apparently you burn him.
3868,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. (Walks away, followed by Varys)."
3869,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5," I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall."
3870,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5, I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
3871,EDD,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," Then I said, if the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldn't make us fart when we died."
3872,GRENN,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, We fart when we die?
3873,EDD,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook."
3874,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?"
3875,EDD,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, We were having a serious discussion.
3876,GRENN,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, Would you look at that.
3877,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
3878,GRENN,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, I prefer watching them come towards me.
3879,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, I'm sure that's nice too.
3880,GRENN,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," Well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, (laughs), changed."
3881,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, You were with her? How many times?
3882,GRENN,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," Well, as many times as I could."
3883,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
3884,EDD,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, We need more potatoes. And get another sack for the sludge. (Sam begins to walk away). Get the turnips too.
3885,SAME,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," No. Ghost, no. No. Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo! (Ghost walks away). (To Gilly)  You all right? Did he frighten you?"
3886,GILLY,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, You shouldn't touch me.
3887,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. (Long pause)."
3888,GILLY,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, You're very brave.
3889,JON,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, What’re you doing?
3890,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters."
3891,JON,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," Hello, Gilly. What’re you doing?"
3892,GILLY,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, Sam said you could help.
3893,JON,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -"
3894,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," She's pregnant. (Gilly encourages Sam to continue). We have to take her with us, when we leave."
3895,JON,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, What? (Stands up).
3896,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, I know it sounds a bit mad.
3897,JON,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible."
3898,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," The Lord Commander, (Jon tries and fails to interrupt Sam), we are sworn to protect -"
3899,JON,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, Sam we can't take her -
3900,GILLY,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," Please sir, please. I can still run if I have to."
3901,JON,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, It's just not possible.
3902,GILLY,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I…"
3903,JON,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," If it's a boy what? (Gilly looks around and then down, not answering). You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why."
3904,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, Why did you do that?
3905,JON,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," Do what, ask her a question?"
3906,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, You were cruel.
3907,JON,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
3908,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, I didn't touch her!
3909,JON,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3, No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
3910,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat."
3911,JON,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?"
3912,SAM,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," I could try. (Jon looks down, annoyed). What? I've read about it. A bit."
3913,JON,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3," I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her."
3914,JORAH,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3, Khaleesi.
3915,JORAH,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3, You don't need to see this.
3916,DAENERYS,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3, He is blood of my blood.
3917,DAENERYS,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3, Who did this?
3918,JORAH,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3," Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar."
3919,DAENERYS,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3, They will like it far less when I'm done with them.
3920,IRRI,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3," No! (Speaking Dothraki, to Daenerys) They killed his soul!"
3921,DAENERYS,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3, (Speaking Dothraki) Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
3922,IRRI,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3, (Speaking Dothraki) They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. (Daenerys kneels to Irri’s level). He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.
3923,DAENERYS,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3, (Speaking Dothraki) Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.
3924,DAENERYS,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3," (Speaking Dothraki) And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight."
3925,WOMAN,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1, Is it as you remember my lord?
3926,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1, (Removes his jacket). Looks smaller.
3927,WOMAN,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1," Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it."
3928,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1, (Removes more of his clothes). They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
3929,WOMAN,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1, Who will?
3930,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1," Anyone who matters, (Takes off his shirt), this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet."
3931,WOMAN,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1, I love the cold and wet.
3932,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1," They say hard places breed hard men, (Unbuttons his pants), and hard men rule the world."
3933,WOMAN,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1, Then you'll be king before long.
3934,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1," (Kneels down). Try smiling with your lips closed. (She does). Hmm, better."
3935,WOMAN,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1, My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.
3936,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1, (Taking off his pants). I don't blame him.
3937,WOMAN,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1," He says that you're all reavers and rapers. And that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be satis-"
3938,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1," Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture."
3939,WOMAN,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1, Capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore. Make me your saltwife.
3940,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1, Your place is on this ship.
3941,WOMAN,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1, Not after you leave. Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.
3942,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1, I haven't paid you.
3943,MAN,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," I barely touched her. And you charge twice as much as every other brothel. And this is what I get, crying."
3944,BAELISH,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," One moment, my friend. A moment."
3945,BAELISH,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.
3946,ROZ,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," I’m sorry, my lord."
3947,BAELISH,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, Shhh. Did he hurt you?
3948,ROZ,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," No, my lord… It’s Mhaegen."
3949,BAELISH,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, Who?
3950,ROZ,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby."
3951,BAELISH,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace."
3952,ROZ,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby."
3953,BAELISH,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. (Stands up). Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen’s child. I’ll see you tomorrow. But you’ll be happy? (Roz nods and smiles). That makes me happy."
3954,PODRICK,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, More wine?
3955,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," Damn it, boy!"
3956,PODRICK,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," Apologies, my lord."
3957,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine."
3958,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, (Podrick leaves). Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.
3959,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," Myself, I prefer the improper ones."
3960,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?"
3961,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," You know your wines, my lord."
3962,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," That I do. A fine dinner, my lord."
3963,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord."
3964,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
3965,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,Wars have been started for less.
3966,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
3967,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done."
3968,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies."
3969,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, Orders are orders.
3970,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
3971,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, I never said they were the queen's orders.
3972,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman."
3973,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, You know your sister better than I do.
3974,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
3975,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, I don't listen to filth.
3976,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children."
3977,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. (Sips his wine)."
3978,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.
3979,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
3980,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
3981,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.
3982,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."
3983,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf."
3984,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here."
3985,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."
3986,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -
3987,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
3988,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
3989,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," No, we shan't."
3990,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way."
3991,BRONN,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord."
3992,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, These men are under my command. (Bronn laughs). I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
3993,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
3994,BRONN,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, Boys?
3995,JANOS,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!
3996,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, To the new Commander.
3997,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7," If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?"
3998,BRONN,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7, Without question? No. I'd ask how much.
3999,LOMMY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1," If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle."
4000,HOT PIE,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, I'm not afraid of no battles.
4001,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1," If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants."
4002,HOT PIE,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, I've seen lots of battles. I saw -
4003,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, Liar.
4004,HOT PIE,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.
4005,LOMMY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, Two men fighting isn't a battle.
4006,HOT PIE,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, They had armor on.
4007,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, So?
4008,HOT PIE,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1," So, if they got armor on, it's a battle."
4009,LOMMY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1," No, it isn't."
4010,HOT PIE,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?
4011,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1," (Gendry walks over to get more water). Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle."
4012,HOT PIE,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, (Hesitates) It's when they've got armor on.
4013,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, Now who told you that.
4014,HOT PIE,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, A knight?
4015,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, How'd you know he was a knight?
4016,HOT PIE,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1," Well, cause he got armor on."
4017,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. (Arya smiles).
4018,HOT PIE,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, How'd you know?
4019,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, ‘Cause I sold armor.
4020,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, What do the gold cloaks want with you?
4021,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, (Turning around) No idea.
4022,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, You're a liar.
4023,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, (Walking to camp fire). You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.
4024,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. (Follows him).
4025,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"  Well, I don’t care what any of them want. No good's ever come of their questions."
4026,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, No good's ever come? Who asked questions before?
4027,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
4028,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, Who asked questions?
4029,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1," The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died."
4030,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, Lord Stark.
4031,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, See? Asking me questions is bad luck. (Walks back to river). You'll probably be dead soon.
4032,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, What did they ask about?
4033,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, My mom.
4034,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, Who's your mom?
4035,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
4036,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, And who was your father?
4037,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1," He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?"
4038,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, I'm not a girl!
4039,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, (Walks back to camp fire). Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
4040,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1," Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that."
4041,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, That's true. You're still a girl.
4042,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, I am not!
4043,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1," Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then."
4044,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can’t know. No one can know.
4045,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, They won't. Not from me.
4046,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
4047,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
4048,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.
4049,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1," So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady."
4050,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1," No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -"
4051,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1," You were a lord's daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady."
4052,ARYA,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1, Do not call me milady.
4053,GENDRY,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1," As milady commands. (Arya pushes him). Well, that was unladylike."
4054,MAN,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, What you carrying?
4055,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. (The man makes no response). The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. (The man continues to make no response). Me.
4056,MAN,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, Don't like wine. Woman's drink. (Returns to his work).
4057,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, I need to get to Pyke.
4058,MAN,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, I'll find you a horse.
4059,YARA,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, I'm heading that way. I can take you there.
4060,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, I bet you can.
4061,YARA,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?
4062,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, None like you.
4063,YARA,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, You don't know what I'm like.
4064,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?
4065,YARA,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.
4066,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, Have my things sent up to the castle.
4067,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3," You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years."
4068,YARA,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?
4069,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, Don't you worry about my hands. (Theon begins fondling her). The sea's in my blood.
4070,YARA,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
4071,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3," I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky."
4072,YARA,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, Is that an offer from my future king?
4073,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3," An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night."
4074,YARA,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
4075,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, Father.
4076,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3," Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?"
4077,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, A man. Your blood and your heir.
4078,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.
4079,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, Lord Stark is gone.
4080,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, And how do you feel about that?
4081,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
4082,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, Who gave you those clothes? (Stands up).  Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?
4083,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3," If my clothes offend you, I will change them."
4084,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, It will. (Begins walking forward). That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? (Theon looks down). I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?
4085,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, Gold.
4086,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. (Balon walks towards the fireplace and looks into it). My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.
4087,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, (Steps forward). My blood is salt and iron.
4088,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3," Yet, (Turns around), the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message."
4089,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3," The offer he makes, is one I proposed."
4090,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, He heeds your counsel?
4091,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3," I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother."
4092,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3," No, not here, (Walks forward), not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?"
4093,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.
4094,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.
4095,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, I will lead the attack myself.
4096,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3," Oh, you will?"
4097,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
4098,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, I told you to wait outside. (The person who entered is revealed to be Yara). How did you get past the guards?
4099,YARA,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
4100,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, (Puts his arm around her). My dear.
4101,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, Yara?
4102,YARA,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3," So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about."
4103,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, She can't lead an attack!
4104,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, And why not?
4105,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, You're a woman!
4106,YARA,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, You're the one in skirts.
4107,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3," This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him."
4108,ALL THREE,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, (Theon joins a little late). What's dead may never die.
4109,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, (Watching the letter burn in his hand). No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. (Throws the letter in the fire). That is who I am. That is who we have always been.
4110,THEON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3, You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
4111,BALON,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,Who said anything about the Lannisters?
4112,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
4113,SAAN,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?"
4114,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey."
4115,SAAN,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," And yet, they both have larger armies."
4116,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.
4117,SAAN,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.
4118,MATTHOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," Mind your words, pirate. (They all stop walking)."
4119,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, Matthos.
4120,SAAN,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.
4121,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them."
4122,SAAN,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, That's a promise that always comes true.
4123,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong"
4124,SAAN,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, Only the clever ones.
4125,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing."
4126,SAAN,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
4127,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, It is. (Matthos rolls his eyes).
4128,SAAN,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," One thing, I want the queen."
4129,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, The queen?
4130,SAAN,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well."
4131,MATTHOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
4132,SAAN,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her."
4133,MATTHOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, As if she would just let you!
4134,SAAN,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.
4135,MATTHOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god."
4136,SAAN,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs."
4137,SAAN,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
4138,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
4139,MATTHOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, You believe your king can win?
4140,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, He is the one true king.
4141,SAAN,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. (They laugh). I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich."
4142,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
4143,MATTHOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, When will the King have a sail?
4144,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, As soon as his God wills it.
4145,MATTHOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. (As they walk). Let me teach you how to read."
4146,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, Oh you and your mother.
4147,MATTHOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
4148,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!"
4149,MATTHOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, But you always came home.
4150,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, I wasn't praying.
4151,MATTHOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," (They reach their horses). But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you."
4152,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis."
4153,MATTHOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3," (As Davos is mounting his horse). Stannis is my king, but he's only a man."
4154,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3, Don't tell him that.
4155,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9, Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
4156,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9, I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
4157,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9, You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
4158,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9," Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"
4159,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9," Ha, the people. You think I care?"
4160,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9," You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” (Cersei says nothing). You don't even have the decency to deny it."
4161,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9," It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse."
4162,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9," He did what needed to be done. (Now loudly). You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."
4163,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9," I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
4164,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9," I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. (Sits down). It's all fallen on me."
4165,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9," (Tries not to laugh). As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
4166,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9," You're funny. (Laughs). You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death."
4167,TYRION,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9, She was my mother too.
4168,CERSEI,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9," Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. (Storms out)."
4169,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, Your Grace.
4170,MATTHOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, Your Grace.
4171,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, How did it fare with your pirate?
4172,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
4173,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5," In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men."
4174,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, Does seem the wiser choice.
4175,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
4176,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5," Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him."
4177,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5," Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us."
4178,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5," At once, Your Grace."
4179,MELISANDRE,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5," The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior."
4180,DAVOS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, Come.
4181,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, What did you say to him?
4182,MELISANDRE,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, I told him death by fire is the purest death.
4183,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, Why?
4184,MELISANDRE,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
4185,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, Yeah.
4186,MELISANDRE,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
4187,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, Tell your lord to burn them then.
4188,MELISANDRE,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
4189,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
4190,MELISANDRE,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, You must have faith.
4191,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5," Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten."
4192,MELISANDRE,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, Then we must be the ten.
4193,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5," I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole."
4194,MELISANDRE,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5," I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."
4195,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5," I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols."
4196,MELISANDRE,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, You must give... all of yourself.
4197,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, I have a wife. I took a vow.
4198,MELISANDRE,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5," She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. (Whispers in his ear). I will give you a son, my King."
4199,STANNIS,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5, (Gasps). A son?
4200,CRASTER,2,13,what is dead may never die,Unnamed Scene_49," Out, all of you."
4201,CRASTER,2,13,what is dead may never die,Unnamed Scene_49, This bastard's been meddling where he shouldn't!
4202,CRASTER,2,13,what is dead may never die,Unnamed Scene_49, (pointing at JEOR with the handle of JEOR's sheathed sword) I want you and your men gone. And you will make this right.
4203,JEOR,2,13,what is dead may never die,Unnamed Scene_49, (to JON) Wait outside.
4204,JON,2,13,what is dead may never die,Unnamed Scene_49, Lord Commander-
4205,JEOR,2,13,what is dead may never die,Unnamed Scene_49, Now!
4206,SAM,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1", Lord Commander-
4207,JEOR,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1", Leave us.
4208,JEOR,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1", What did you do?
4209,JON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1"," I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn."
4210,JEOR,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1", What business is that of yours?
4211,JON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1"," No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys..."
4212,JON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1", You know.
4213,JEOR,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1", Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.
4214,JON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1", Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
4215,JEOR,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1"," Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster."
4216,JON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1", I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.
4217,JEOR,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1"," Yeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn."
4218,JEOR,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1", Don't lose it again.
4219,SAM,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, THE NEXT MORNING_1", (whispering) Gilly.
4220,GILLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, THE NEXT MORNING_1", You're leaving.
4221,SAM,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, THE NEXT MORNING_1"," I, I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother."
4222,GILLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, THE NEXT MORNING_1", I can't take it.
4223,SAM,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, THE NEXT MORNING_1", Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
4224,GILLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, THE NEXT MORNING_1"," You, you shouldn't give it away."
4225,SAM,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, THE NEXT MORNING_1", I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you.
4226,SAM,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, THE NEXT MORNING_1", Keep it safe for me. Til I come back.
4227,HODOR,2,13,what is dead may never die,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1, Hodor.
4228,LUWIN,2,13,what is dead may never die,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1," Hodor. Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons."
4229,BRAN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"WINTERFELL, BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1", (voiceover) Every night it's the same.
4230,BRAN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"WINTERFELL, BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1"," I'm walking and running, but I'm not I'm not me. I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves."
4231,LUWIN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"WINTERFELL, BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1"," That's exactly what they are, Bran - stories."
4232,BRAN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"WINTERFELL, BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1", So she was lying? They don't exist?
4233,LUWIN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"WINTERFELL, BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1"," Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more."
4234,BRAN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"WINTERFELL, BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1"," No, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying. And Rickon had the same dream."
4235,LUWIN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"WINTERFELL, BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1", What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.
4236,LUWIN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"WINTERFELL, BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1"," This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on."
4237,LUWIN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"WINTERFELL, BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1", All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.
4238,MARGAERY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1", (standing and clapping) Loras! Highgarden!
4239,MAN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1", Get him!
4240,CROWD,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1", Oh!
4241,LORAS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1", Yield! I yield.
4242,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1", (claps) Well fought. Approach.
4243,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1", Rise. Remove your helm.
4244,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," You are all your father promised and more, my lady. I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion."
4245,MARGAERY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you."
4246,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," That he did, my queen. But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours."
4247,BRIENNE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," (kneels) Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard."
4248,LORAS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1", What?
4249,BRIENNE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm."
4250,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," Done. Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard."
4251,COLEN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell."
4252,CATELYN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1", Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.
4253,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?"
4254,MARGAERY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss."
4255,CATELYN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1", You are most kind.
4256,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," My lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husband's murder. When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head."
4257,CATELYN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord."
4258,BRIENNE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1", Your Grace. And you should kneel when you approach the King.
4259,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1", There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.
4260,LORAS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1", Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?
4261,CATELYN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," (disdainfully) I do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you."
4262,LORAS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," (petulantly) If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts."
4263,CATELYN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," My son is fighting a war, not playing at one."
4264,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP, TOURNAMENT_1"," Don't worry, my lady. Our war is just beginning."
4265,GERARD,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1, Your Grace.
4266,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1, Gerard. How's your foot?
4267,GERARD,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1," Better, Your Grace."
4268,GERARD,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1, They don't know their own size is all.
4269,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1, Good man.
4270,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1, I have a hundred thousand men at my command. All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.
4271,CATELYN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1," And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them."
4272,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1, Why?
4273,CATELYN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1, Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
4274,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1," Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. She's tired from her journey."
4275,BRIENNE,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1," At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?"
4276,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1, That won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone.
4277,BRIENNE,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1," If you'll follow me, my lady."
4278,CATELYN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1," You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne."
4279,BRIENNE,2,13,what is dead may never die,RENLY'S CAMP_1," I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady."
4280,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", What are you doing here?
4281,YARA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1"," I live here. Are you angry with me, brother?"
4282,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", You lying bitch.
4283,YARA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.
4284,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you- you looked like a fat little boy.
4285,YARA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1"," You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you."
4286,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", Why didn't you tell me?
4287,YARA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", I wanted to see who you were first. And I did.
4288,BALON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", The plans are made. It's time you heard them.
4289,YARA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", Father.
4290,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", Father.
4291,BALON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1"," The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall."
4292,BALON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1"," Yara, my daughter, you'll take thirty longships to attack Deepwood Motte."
4293,YARA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", I've always wanted a castle.
4294,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", And what's my role in all this?
4295,BALON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
4296,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?
4297,YARA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.
4298,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", (incredulous) I'm to fight fishermen?
4299,YARA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", Be careful of their nets.
4300,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1"," Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily."
4301,YARA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", They won't even know we're there until it's too late.
4302,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1"," What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior."
4303,BALON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1"," Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect."
4304,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1"," I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock."
4305,BALON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", What are our words? Our words?
4306,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", We do not sow.
4307,BALON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", We do not sow. We are Ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
4308,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1"," You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?"
4309,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", You gave me away!
4310,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.
4311,YARA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", You'd have our father bow down to your other family?
4312,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1", I have no other family.
4313,YARA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM_1"," Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you."
4314,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1", You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me-
4315,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1", (shushing her) Keep your voice down.
4316,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1", Why? You think your father can hear me? (yells) He's three hundred miles away!
4317,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1", I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
4318,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1"," Again, only temporary."
4319,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1", Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
4320,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1", But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.
4321,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1", Scullion? What is a scullion?
4322,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1", (wincing) Kitchen wench.
4323,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1", A kitchen wench?
4324,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1"," Yes, but-"
4325,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1", Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?
4326,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1", Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.
4327,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1", I'm the weakness?
4328,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1"," It's a compliment, my lady."
4329,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1", How is being a weakness a compliment?
4330,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1", Language can be a bit tricky here.
4331,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1"," (with a mocking tone) Oh, I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. (sternly) I am not a kitchen wench."
4332,MYRCELLA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, DINING HALL, NIGHT_1", When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?
4333,CERSEI,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, DINING HALL, NIGHT_1"," Soon, darling, when the war is over."
4334,MYRCELLA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, DINING HALL, NIGHT_1"," (to SANSA) Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride."
4335,CERSEI,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, DINING HALL, NIGHT_1", The princess just spoke to you.
4336,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, DINING HALL, NIGHT_1"," (to CERSEI) Pardon, Your Grace. (to MYRCELLA) I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods."
4337,TOMMEN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, DINING HALL, NIGHT_1", Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?
4338,CERSEI,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, DINING HALL, NIGHT_1", He might.
4339,CERSEI,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, DINING HALL, NIGHT_1", Would you like that?
4340,TOMMEN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, DINING HALL, NIGHT_1", No. I don't think so.
4341,CERSEI,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, DINING HALL, NIGHT_1"," Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?"
4342,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Come in.
4343,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Who are you?
4344,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," I'm Shae, my lady. Your new handmaiden."
4345,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.
4346,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", No.
4347,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", What are you doing?
4348,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
4349,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.
4350,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", What things?
4351,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," (irritated) Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair."
4352,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", No.
4353,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", You said to brush your-
4354,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", (exasperated) Not now.
4355,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Your chamber pot is empty.
4356,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Clean the table.
4357,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Have you ever been a handmaiden before?
4358,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Yes.
4359,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", For whom?
4360,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Lady Zuriff.
4361,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Lady Zuriff
4362,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Lady Zuriff.
4363,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
4364,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", She wasn't in this city.
4365,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," (testily, with a wavering voice) I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job."
4366,SHAE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Do you want me to leave?
4367,SANSA,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Just brush my hair.
4368,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
4369,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily."
4370,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
4371,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", Please.
4372,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," Thank you, my lord."
4373,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?"
4374,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," Why, yes, of course, my lord."
4375,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
4376,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," Matrimony, huh? Yes."
4377,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."
4378,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave."
4379,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it."
4380,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
4381,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," But remember, the Queen mustn't know."
4382,VARYS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," Ooh. ""The Queen mustn't know."" I love conversations that begin this way."
4383,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
4384,VARYS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark."
4385,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", Precisely.
4386,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
4387,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," But remember, you must tell no one."
4388,LITTLEFINGER,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", Tell no one what?
4389,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
4390,LITTLEFINGER,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
4391,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
4392,LITTLEFINGER,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
4393,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", Who better?
4394,LITTLEFINGER,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"
4395,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal."
4396,LITTLEFINGER,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", Harrenhal is cursed.
4397,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands."
4398,LITTLEFINGER,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm."
4399,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
4400,LITTLEFINGER,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away."
4401,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1"," I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?"
4402,LITTLEFINGER,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", (nods)
4403,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", Good. Oh. And remember-
4404,LITTLEFINGER,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1", The Queen mustn't know.
4405,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", That must hurt.
4406,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", What? What is it?
4407,LORAS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", (scoffs) A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
4408,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Brienne is a very capable warrior.
4409,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", And she's devoted to me. You're jealous.
4410,LORAS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.
4411,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I'll make it up to you.
4412,LORAS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone."
4413,LORAS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
4414,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", And Margaery's a virgin?
4415,LORAS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Officially. Shall I bring her to you?
4416,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1"," I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine."
4417,MARGAERY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", As is your right. You are a king.
4418,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", You look very beautiful.
4419,MARGAERY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1"," Thank you, Your Grace."
4420,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", It's a lovely gown.
4421,MARGAERY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1"," You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way."
4422,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1",  You certainly don't need it.
4423,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1"," Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed."
4424,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Must be the wine.
4425,MARGAERY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1"," Here, let me."
4426,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", I'm sorry.
4427,MARGAERY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Do you want my brother to come in and help?
4428,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", What?
4429,MARGAERY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
4430,RENLY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", I don't know what you're talking about.
4431,MARGAERY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.
4432,MARGAERY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1"," Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like."
4433,MARGAERY,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Whatever you need to do. You are a king.
4434,CERSEL,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", (angry and tearful) You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
4435,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
4436,CERSEI,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
4437,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Dorne is the safest place for her.
4438,CERSEI,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
4439,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
4440,CERSEI,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", She'll be a hostage.
4441,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", A guest.
4442,CERSEI,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too."
4443,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," It's done, Cersei."
4444,CERSEI,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",  No.
4445,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", You cannot stop it.
4446,CERSEI,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",  No!
4447,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours."
4448,CERSEI,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Get out! Get out!
4449,PRIEST,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, SHORELINE_1"," Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?"
4450,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, SHORELINE_1", I would.
4451,DROWNED PRIEST,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, SHORELINE_1",  Kneel.
4452,DROWNED PRIEST,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, SHORELINE_1"," Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
4453,THEON,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, SHORELINE_1", What is dead may never die.
4454,DROWNED PRIEST,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, SHORELINE_1", What is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand.
4455,LITTLEFINGER,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?"
4456,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," No, afraid not. Sorry about that."
4457,LITTLEFINGER,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well."
4458,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too."
4459,LITTLEFINGER,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Leave me out of your next deception.
4460,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in."
4461,LITTLEFINGER,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
4462,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"
4463,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Find him?
4464,BRONN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt."
4465,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," No, you don't."
4466,BRONN,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," No, I don't."
4467,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1", What is the meaning of this?
4468,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1"," No, please, please."
4469,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1"," You disappoint me, Grand Maester."
4470,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1", I am your loyal servant.
4471,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1", So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
4472,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1"," No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider."
4473,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1"," See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you."
4474,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1", The eunuch has spies everywhere.
4475,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1", Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
4476,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1"," No, no, no."
4477,TIMETT,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1"," There are no goats, halfman."
4478,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1"," Well, make do."
4479,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1", How long have you been spying for my sister?
4480,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1"," All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King."
4481,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1", (to BRONN) I don't like his beard.
4482,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1", What? What?
4483,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1"," Oh, no. No."
4484,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1"," How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?"
4485,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1"," Oh, Lord Arryn, h-he knew. He, he knew the t-truth about, about, about the Queen. An-And he planned to act, to t-tell King Robert."
4486,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1", So you poisoned him?
4487,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1", (offended) No. Never.
4488,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1"," But you let him die, made sure he succumbed."
4489,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1"," Lannister, I always served Lannister."
4490,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1", Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
4491,PYCELLE,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1"," Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!"
4492,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1", For your trouble.
4493,VARYS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3", You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
4494,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3", Good. One of my better ideas.
4495,VARYS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3", And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
4496,VARYS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3"," Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day."
4497,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3", The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
4498,VARYS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3"," Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?"
4499,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3"," Why, am I about to hear one?"
4500,VARYS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3"," Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?"
4501,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3", Depends on the sellsword.
4502,VARYS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3", Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
4503,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3"," He has a sword, the power of life and death."
4504,VARYS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3"," But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?"
4505,TYRION,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3", I've decided I don't like riddles.
4506,VARYS,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3"," Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."
4507,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us."
4508,ARYA,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, I can't sleep.
4509,ARYA,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, I don't like the taste.
4510,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," (chuckles) Well... You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest."
4511,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, What?
4512,ARYA,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, How do you sleep?
4513,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," Same as most men, I think."
4514,ARYA,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," But you've seen things, horrible things."
4515,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many."
4516,ARYA,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, How do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?
4517,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, You didn't see that. I made damn sure.
4518,ARYA,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and... and my sister."
4519,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lad's name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?"
4520,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves."
4521,GENDRY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, Get up.
4522,ARYA,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, Get up.
4523,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," Keep out of sight, both of you."
4524,ARYA,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," No, I'm not afraid."
4525,GENDRY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, I can fight.
4526,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," (pointing at both of them) Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back."
4527,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," (yelling) Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!"
4528,MAN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," Come on, move, move!"
4529,MAN #1,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, Gold Cloaks!
4530,MAN #2,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, Everyone out!
4531,PRISONER,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," Hey, you! Open the damn cage!"
4532,AMORY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," Where's the bastard, crow?"
4533,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, Got more than a few bastards here. Who's asking?
4534,AMORY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," Ser Amory Lorch, sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister. These men from the capital requested our assistance. Drop your weapons in the name of the King."
4535,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," Now, which king would that be?"
4536,AMORY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," This is your last chance. In the name of King Joffrey, drop your weapons."
4537,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, I don't think I will.
4538,AMORY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, So be it.
4539,YOREN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, I always hated crossbows. Take too long to load.
4540,JAQEN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," Boy, come here. Boy! Sweet boy, help us."
4541,JAQEN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," Come back here! Help us, boy! A man can fight! Free us!"
4542,JAQEN,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," Quick, give it to me."
4543,BITER,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, Give me the ax. Give me that.
4544,GOLD CLOAK #1,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, Put them on the wagon!
4545,GOLD CLOAK #2,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, There's more here. Come on.
4546,POLLIVER,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, What do we have here?
4547,ARYA,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, No!
4548,POLLIVER,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, That's a fine little blade. Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
4549,HOT PIE,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, I yield! I yield!
4550,ARMORY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, Round up any survivors. We'll take them back to Harrenhal.
4551,POLLIVER,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, You heard him. You're coming with us.
4552,HOT PIE,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, I yield!
4553,LOMMY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, Help! Help me!
4554,POLLIVER,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," Something wrong with your leg, boy?"
4555,LOMMY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, Look at it.
4556,POLLIVER,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, Can you walk?
4557,LOMMY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, No. You got to carry me.
4558,POLLIVER,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, All right.
4559,POLLIVER,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1," ""Carry him,"" he says."
4560,AMORY,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, We're looking for a bastard named Gendry. Give him up or I'll start taking eyeballs.
4561,ARYA,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, You want Gendry?
4562,ARYA,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, You already got him.
4563,ARYA,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1, He loved that helmet.
4564,GUARD #1,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest. He's the strongest.
4565,RENNICK,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, Bulls are bigger than lions. Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.
4566,GUARD #1,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," If the bull had fangs and claws, I would. Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime."
4567,RENNICK,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, If he ever gets out.
4568,GUARD #1,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, Loras Tyrell?
4569,RENNICK,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.
4570,GUARD #1,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, I don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them.
4571,RENNICK,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead."
4572,RENNICK,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.
4573,GUARD #1,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, They get spooked by their own shadows.
4574,RENNICK,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, Shh. Do you hear that?
4575,GUARD #1,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, No.
4576,RENNICK,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, There's something out there.
4577,GUARD #1,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," Oh. Oh, you're a right little prick. You should see your face."
4578,RENNICK,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," I swear you pissed yourself. ""Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"""
4579,GUARD #1,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, There is something out there.
4580,RENNICK,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," Yeah, don't even try me."
4581,GUARD #1,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, Rennick.
4582,RENNICK,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, Do you think I'm an idiot?
4583,GUARD #1,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, Rennick!
4584,MAN,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, King in the North!
4585,MEN,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, The King in the North!
4586,ROOSE BOLTON,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own.
4587,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton."
4588,ROOSE BOLTON,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans."
4589,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, I doubt it.
4590,ROOSE BOLTON,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, ""A naked man has few secrets. ""A flayed man none."""
4591,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, My father outlawed flaying in the North.
4592,ROOSE BOLTON,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, We're not in the North.
4593,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, We're not torturing them.
4594,ROOSE BOLTON,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," The high road's very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it."
4595,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.
4596,WOUNDED SOLDIER,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," No, don't! Don't! Please!"
4597,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, Shhh.
4598,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, The rot's set in.
4599,WOUNDED SOLDIER,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," No, don't! No, don't!"
4600,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, Shh.
4601,WOUNDED SOLDIER,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," Please, don't! It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt."
4602,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, The rot will spread if we don't take the foot now
4603,WOUNDED SOLDIER,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," No, you can't!"
4604,WOUNDED SOLDIER,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," Ser! Please, ser. I can't lose-"
4605,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, You'll die if she doesn't.
4606,WOUNDED SOLDIER,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," I don't want to be a cripple, please."
4607,ROOSE BOLTON,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.
4608,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," Your men are not my men, my lord."
4609,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.
4610,WOUNDED SOLDIER,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50, No! You can't!
4611,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_50," Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me."
4612,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, What's your name?
4613,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, Talisa.
4614,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, Your last name?
4615,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, You want to know what side my family fights on?
4616,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.
4617,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, That boy lost his foot on your orders.
4618,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, They killed my father.
4619,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, That boy did?
4620,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, The family he fights for.
4621,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
4622,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, I have no hatred for the lad.
4623,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, That should help his foot grow back.
4624,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1," You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey."
4625,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, You're going to kill Joffrey?
4626,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, If the gods give me strength.
4627,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, And then what?
4628,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
4629,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, So who will?
4630,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, I don't know.
4631,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1," You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?"
4632,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, First we have to win the war.
4633,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, You never told me where you're from.
4634,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, Volantis.
4635,ROBB,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.
4636,TALISA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, He was unlucky that you were.
4637,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.
4638,SANSA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1," Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please"
4639,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1," Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage."
4640,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1," Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain."
4641,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, Killing you would send your brother a message.
4642,SANSA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, (cries)
4643,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn.
4644,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, Leave her face. I like her pretty.
4645,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1," Meryn, my lady is overdressed. Unburden her."
4646,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1," If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder."
4647,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, What is the meaning of this?
4648,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
4649,MERYN,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1," The kind who serves his king, Imp."
4650,BRONN,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1," Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak."
4651,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
4652,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, I'm punishing her.
4653,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1," For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit."
4654,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!
4655,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
4656,MERYN,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
4657,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1," I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?"
4658,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
4659,SANSA,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1," I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love."
4660,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1," Lady Stark, you may survive us yet."
4661,BRONN,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.
4662,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
4663,BRONN,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1, There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
4664,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1," What are you doing here, dog?"
4665,HOUND,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1, Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.
4666,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1, And? What is it?
4667,HOUND,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1," Look inside, Your Grace."
4668,DAISY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1, Your Grace.
4669,ROS,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1," Happy nameday, Your Grace."
4670,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1, My nameday has passed.
4671,ROS,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1, We won't tell if you won't.
4672,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1, No. Her. Touch her.
4673,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1, Could you hit her?
4674,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1, My uncle sent you?
4675,DAISY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1," Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself."
4676,ROS,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1, Hmm.
4677,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1, Use this.
4678,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1, Harder.
4679,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1, I said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth.
4680,ROS,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1," Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure."
4681,DAISY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1," Please, Your Grace."
4682,ROS,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1," Your Grace, if your uncle finds out"
4683,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1," Oh, I want him to find out. You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done, or the same thing will happen to you."
4684,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1, Begin.
4685,JOFFREY,2,14,garden of bones,RED KEEP HALLWAY_1, Harder!
4686,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_1"," Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger. Pray I haven't kept you waiting long."
4687,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_1", Your Grace.
4688,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_1"," Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron?"
4689,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_1", I'm a practical man.
4690,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_1", Just not a loyal one.
4691,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_1", And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?
4692,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_1"," I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?"
4693,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_1", You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.
4694,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_1"," You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim."
4695,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_1"," Now I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head."
4696,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_1", I would give priority to my head.
4697,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_1", (snorts)
4698,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_1"," I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates."
4699,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", Your Grace.
4700,MARGAERY,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", Lord Baelish.
4701,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", All of these tents look the same to me. Would you be so kind-
4702,MARGAERY,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again."
4703,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," ""Your tent""? Not ""Our tent""? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne."
4704,MARGAERY,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers."
4705,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now."
4706,MARGAERY,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.
4707,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?"
4708,MARGAERY,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", You seem quite interested in our marriage.
4709,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else."
4710,MARGAERY,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," You've never married, have you?"
4711,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly."
4712,MARGAERY,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night."
4713,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", (Valerian) This isn't your horse.
4714,KOVARRO,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", (Valerian) It was given to me by the Thirteen. The Elders of Qarth.
4715,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", (Valerian) Qarth?
4716,KOVARRO,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," (Valerian) Three days to the east, on the sea."
4717,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", (Valerian) Will they let us in?
4718,KOVARRO,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", (Valerian) They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons.
4719,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", What do you know of this place?
4720,JORAH,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows."
4721,MAN #3,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", Go on!
4722,MAN #4,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," You, keep moving!"
4723,MAN,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", Bring her about!
4724,HOT PIE,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", What kind of fire melts stone?
4725,ARYA,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", Dragonfire.
4726,HOT PIE,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", There's dragons here?
4727,GENDRY,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," No, all the dragons are dead."
4728,HOT PIE,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", What's that smell?
4729,ARYA,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", Dead people.
4730,SOLDIER,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", Move.
4731,MAN,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Please, please, no, no! No."
4732,WOMAN,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1"," He's dead. He was my son. My sister was three days ago. My husband, the day before that."
4733,GENDRY,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", They take someone every day?
4734,WOMAN,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", (nods)
4735,ARYA,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT_1", Does anyone live?
4736,ARYA,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
4737,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", How dare you?
4738,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", You may have heard false reports.
4739,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", You betrayed Ned.
4740,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.
4741,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1",I trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery.
4742,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1"," No, my lady."
4743,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", Get out!
4744,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1"," Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance"
4745,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", Have you lost your mind? Get out!
4746,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1"," Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?"
4747,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1"," You have Arya, too?"
4748,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.
4749,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", What do you want?
4750,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.
4751,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.
4752,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.
4753,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", You think I keep secrets from my son?
4754,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1"," Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift."
4755,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.
4756,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", Good faith?
4757,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", What's this?
4758,LITTLEFINGER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe
4759,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", Get out.
4760,MAN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Get up, you dogs!"
4761,HOT PIE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," That's him, the one who picks."
4762,ARYA,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", The Mountain. What are you doing?
4763,HOT PIE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", He told me he stares at him every day. That's why he doesn't get picked.
4764,MOUNTAIN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", You.
4765,SOLDIER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Move, boy! Move!"
4766,THE TICKLER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Is there gold and silver in the village?
4767,PRISONER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", I don't know.
4768,THE TICKLER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Gems?
4769,PRISONER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", I didn't see any.
4770,THE TICKLER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Where is the Brotherhood?
4771,PRISONER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", I don't know.
4772,THE TICKLER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Where is the Brotherhood?
4773,PRISONER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", I don't know. Please.
4774,THE TICKLER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Where is the Brotherhood?
4775,PRISONER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", I don't know.
4776,THE TICKLER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Which of the villagers aided them?
4777,PRISONER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1",I don't know.
4778,THE TICKLER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Who?
4779,PRISONER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", I-
4780,THE TICKLER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Who?
4781,PRISONER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," I never saw. Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to-"
4782,THE TICKLER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1",  Who?
4783,PRISONER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", I didn't see anyone help him. Take it off! Take it off!
4784,THE TICKLER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Who helped him?
4785,PRISONER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1","  Ganes, the butcher,  and his son."
4786,THE TICKLER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1",  That's better. You've been very helpful.
4787,PRISONER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," No, stop, please! What are you doing? Please, stop! Please, stop!"
4788,PRISONER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", No! No! I told you everything! No! No!
4789,ARYA,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
4790,WOMAN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Please, Polliver. Some food. Just a crust of bread."
4791,ARYA,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Polliver. The Mountain.

4793,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands."
4794,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis."
4795,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Can that truly be you?
4796,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Who else might it be?
4797,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?"
4798,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", My own.
4799,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?"
4800,MELISANDRE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
4801,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age."
4802,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Watch yourself, Renly."
4803,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man."
4804,MELISANDRE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," You should kneel before your brother. He's the Lord's chosen, born amidst salt and smoke."
4805,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Born amidst salt and smoke? Is he a ham?
4806,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", That's twice I've warned you.
4807,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers."
4808,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me."
4809,CATELYN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", We share a common enemy.
4810,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.
4811,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power."
4812,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you."
4813,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?"
4814,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
4815,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
4816,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see."
4817,MELISANDRE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors."
4818,RENLY,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Would you believe I loved him once?
4819,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", I thought we were welcome.
4820,JORAH,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi."
4821,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Horde?
4822,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", My name is Daenerys-
4823,SPICE KING,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.
4824,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," You know me, my lord?"
4825,SPICE KING,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons."
4826,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", And what should I call you?
4827,SPICE KING,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be."
4828,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1",  The beauty of Quarth is legendary-
4829,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1",  Qarth.
4830,SPICE KING,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Might we see the dragons?
4831,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored"
4832,SPICE KING,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves."
4833,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", I am not a liar.
4834,SPICE KING,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value."
4835,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates."
4836,SPICE KING,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Then perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well.
4837,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", What are you doing? You promised to receive me.
4838,SPICE KING,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," We have received you. Here we are, and here you are."
4839,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," If you do not let us in, all of us will die."
4840,SPICE KING,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
4841,JORAH,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Khaleesi, please be careful."
4842,DAENERYS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first."
4843,SPICE KING,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Ah. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die. And so-"
4844,XARO,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.
4845,SPICE KING,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken."
4846,XARO,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking."
4847,SPICE KING,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons.
4848,XARO,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands."
4849,SPICE KING,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Our decision is final.
4850,XARO,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Very well. I invoke soumai.
4851,XARO,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law."
4852,SPICE KING,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Be it on your head.
4853,XARO,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1"," Welcome to Qarth, my lady."
4854,THE MOUNTAIN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", (to Gendry) You.
4855,THE TICKLER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Is there gold or silver in the village?
4856,GENDRY,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", I'm not from the village.
4857,THE TICKLER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", Where is the Brotherhood?
4858,GENDRY,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, PRISONER ENCAMPMENT_1", I don't know what that is.
4859,MAN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", You two. Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.
4860,TYWIN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", What's this?
4861,THE MOUNTAIN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin."
4862,TYWIN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
4863,THE MOUNTAIN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Cells are overflowing, my lord."
4864,POLLIVER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just-"
4865,TYWIN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?
4866,TYWIN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," You, do you have a trade?"
4867,GENDRY,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Smith, my lord."
4868,POLLIVER,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy."
4869,TYWIN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?"
4870,ARYA,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Safer to travel, my lord."
4871,TYWIN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.
4872,THE MOUNTAIN,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", My lord.
4873,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Your visits are too few, cousin."

4875,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",  So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
4876,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp."
4877,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?"
4878,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately."
4879,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
4880,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", As I said several times.
4881,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
4882,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay."
4883,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf."
4884,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn.
4885,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
4886,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl."
4887,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", I am a knight!
4888,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?"
4889,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
4890,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
4891,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", It's not my fault!
4892,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?"
4893,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything."
4894,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Did he tell you to fuck her, too?"
4895,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", I only meant I did as I was bid.
4896,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this."
4897,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you."
4898,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
4899,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear."
4900,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," No, I think not."
4901,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", My lord?
4902,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me."
4903,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command."
4904,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent."
4905,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", But her demands?
4906,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Oh, I'll give her Pycelle."
4907,LANCEL,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", You will?
4908,TYRION,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length."
4909,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Your Grace.
4910,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?
4911,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean."
4912,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Fewer.
4913,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Pardon?
4914,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
4915,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
4916,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good."
4917,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
4918,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Does he listen?
4919,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest"
4920,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
4921,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", I've lived within the law for seventeen-
4922,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", I want you to be a smuggler this time.
4923,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?"
4924,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
4925,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways."
4926,STANNIS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Cleaner ways don't win wars.
4927,MELISANDRE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Are you afraid, Onion Knight?"
4928,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
4929,MELISANDRE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","  You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?"
4930,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad."
4931,MELISANDRE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","  If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil."
4932,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", And which are you?
4933,MELISANDRE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life."
4934,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Well, that must be very nice for you."
4935,MELISANDRE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Do you love your wife?
4936,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", I do.
4937,MELISANDRE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",  Yet you have known other women.
4938,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Don't talk about my wife.
4939,MELISANDRE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","  I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe."
4940,MELISANDRE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",  And you will.
4941,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
4942,MELISANDRE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are."
4943,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
4944,MELISANDRE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", They can't bar our passage.
4945,DAVOS,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1", Gods protect us.
4946,MELISANDRE,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1"," There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him."
4947,RENLY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, You swear it?
4948,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
4949,RENLY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51," Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty."
4950,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, And the wording of this oath?
4951,RENLY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51," The same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together."
4952,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, And in return for my son's loyalty?
4953,RENLY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51," In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army."
4954,RENLY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51," When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before."
4955,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51," Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother."
4956,RENLY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.
4957,RENLY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
4958,BRIENNE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, No! No.
4959,SOLDIER #1,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, Follow me!
4960,SOLDIER #2,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, (to BRIENNE) You'll die for this.
4961,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51," No, wait, it wasn't her!"
4962,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.
4963,MAN #1,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, Inside the king's tent - go
4964,MAN #2,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, Now.
4965,BRIENNE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, I won't leave him.
4966,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, You can't avenge him if you're dead.
4967,MAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51," Over there, go!"
4968,BRIENNE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_51, Not that way.
4969,MARGAERY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, We need to go home. Loras.
4970,LITTLEFINGER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," My lord, my lady."
4971,LORAS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, Get out.
4972,LITTLEFINGER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king."
4973,LORAS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, And you want that privilege for yourself.
4974,LITTLEFINGER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis."
4975,MARGAERY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, There's no time for this.
4976,LORAS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis."
4977,MARGAERY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
4978,LORAS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?
4979,LITTLEFINGER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, Stannis.
4980,LORAS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, I will put a sword through his righteous face.
4981,MARGAERY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, You can't stay here.
4982,LORAS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," He would have been a true king, a good king."
4983,LITTLEFINGER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?"
4984,LORAS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, Revenge.
4985,LITTLEFINGER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."
4986,MARGAERY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.
4987,MARGAERY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, He was very handsome.
4988,LITTLEFINGER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," He was, Your Grace."
4989,MARGAERY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," ""Your Grace."" Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen."
4990,LITTLEFINGER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, Do you want to be a queen?
4991,MARGAERY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, No. I want to be the queen.
4992,CERSEI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, Killed? By whom?
4993,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
4994,CERSEI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, Really? Who'd have thought?
4995,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
4996,CERSEI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," Whomever did it, I say well done."
4997,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."
4998,CERSEI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
4999,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
5000,CERSEI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?"
5001,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, She'll be safer in Dorne.
5002,CERSEI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."
5003,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
5004,CERSEI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
5005,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
5006,CERSEI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
5007,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
5008,CERSEI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
5009,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, It's important that we talk about this.
5010,CERSEI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
5011,LANCEL,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, It's wildfire.
5012,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
5013,LANCEL,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, No.
5014,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,MThat's a lie right there.
5015,LANCEL,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
5016,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
5017,LANCEL,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, I'm telling you the truth.
5018,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, The smart money would be on more likely.
5019,LANCEL,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, She's making wildfire.
5020,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
5021,LANCEL,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
5022,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, I suppose there's only one way to find out.
5023,LANCEL,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.
5024,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, When did she tell you this?
5025,LANCEL,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you."
5026,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, Swear to me on what?
5027,LANCEL,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, On my life.
5028,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, But I don't care about your life.
5029,LANCEL,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow..."
5030,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out."
5031,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1," Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me."
5032,LANCEL,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.
5033,BRONN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1, It will be my pleasure.
5034,DAVOS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", Your Grace.
5035,STANNIS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", What is it?
5036,DAVOS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him."
5037,STANNIS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
5038,DAVOS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
5039,STANNIS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
5040,DAVOS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," Your Grace, I-"
5041,STANNIS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
5042,DAVOS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", And I've never known you to hide from the truth.
5043,STANNIS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", You've come to lecture me on truth?
5044,DAVOS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", I've come to tell you that what I saw.
5045,STANNIS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne."
5046,DAVOS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron"
5047,STANNIS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", I'll hear no more about it.
5048,MAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," Take a company of men, secure the perimeter."
5049,DAVOS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", When do we sail for King's Landing?
5050,STANNIS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."
5051,DAVOS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
5052,STANNIS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", That's not your concern.
5053,DAVOS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers."
5054,STANNIS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
5055,DAVOS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", Loyal service means telling hard truths.
5056,STANNIS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?"
5057,DAVOS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
5058,STANNIS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", What do you believe?
5059,DAVOS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
5060,STANNIS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
5061,DAVOS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy."
5062,STANNIS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."
5063,GIRL,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", I've got it! I've got it!
5064,MAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," So it's that one there at the top, on the right."
5065,MAN #2,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit."
5066,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?"
5067,BRONN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
5068,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
5069,BRONN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
5070,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."
5071,PROTESTER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", Corruption.
5072,CROWD,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", Yes!
5073,PROTESTER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," We are swollen, bloated, foul. Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king."
5074,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", It's hard to argue with his assessment.
5075,BRONN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", Not after what he did to your birthday present.
5076,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
5077,MAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3"," A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey."
5078,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", You have to admire his imagination.
5079,BRONN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", He's talking about you.
5080,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", What? Demon monkey?
5081,BRONN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.
5082,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
5083,BRONN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", You don't need to convince me.
5084,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3", Demon monkey.
5085,MAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," Yeah, come on."
5086,THEON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.
5087,THEON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!
5088,BLACK LORREN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," Where are we headed, Captain?"
5089,THEON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well."
5090,BLACK LORREN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", And who decides if we've done our jobs well?
5091,THEON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", I do. Your captain.
5092,BLACK LORREN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?"
5093,THEON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."
5094,BLACK LORREN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", (laughs)
5095,YARA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", Stop. We yield.
5096,YARA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", Congratulations on your first command.
5097,THEON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
5098,YARA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got thirty ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow."
5099,THEON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
5100,YARA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore."
5101,DAGMER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," Come on, I'll take you out."
5102,THEON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", Who are you?
5103,DAGMER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," Dagmer, your first mate."
5104,THEON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
5105,DAGMER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
5106,THEON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
5107,DAGMER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", You're not.
5108,THEON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
5109,DAGMER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?
5110,THEON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
5111,DAGMER,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?"
5112,THEON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","  No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-"
5113,THEON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", Take me to my ship.
5114,REGINALD,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed."
5115,TYWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.
5116,AMORY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
5117,TYWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?"
5118,REGINALD,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep."
5119,TYWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you."
5120,REGINALD,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", My wife's in Lannisport.
5121,TYWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head."
5122,TYWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!"
5123,TYWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?"
5124,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," Maidenpool, my lord."
5125,TYWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
5126,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," House Mooton, my lord."
5127,TYWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", And what is their sigil?
5128,TYWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?"
5129,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", (nods)
5130,TYWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," Good. One more time, where are you from?"
5131,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown."
5132,TYWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
5133,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", They call him the Young Wolf.
5134,TYWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", And?
5135,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.
5136,TYWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", And do you believe them?
5137,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," No, my lord. Anyone can be killed."
5138,TYWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", Fetch that water.
5139,JAQEN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", A girl says nothing.
5140,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", (gasps)
5141,JAQEN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl."
5142,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", I was always a girl.
5143,JAQEN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.
5144,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.
5145,JAQEN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
5146,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", I didn't have a choice.
5147,JAQEN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", You did. I did. And here we are.
5148,JAQEN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", A man pays his debts. A man owes three.
5149,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", Three what?
5150,JAQEN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done."
5151,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", I can name anyone and you'll kill him?
5152,JAQEN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", A man has said.
5153,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", The one who tortures everyone.
5154,JAQEN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", A man needs a name.
5155,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1", I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.
5156,JAQEN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1"," That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty."
5157,JEOR,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1," He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn."
5158,JON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, When will he come?
5159,JEOR,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, The Halfhand does things in his own time.
5160,JON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, My uncle told me stories about him.
5161,JEOR,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, Most of them are true.
5162,JON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
5163,JEOR,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.
5164,JON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
5165,JEOR,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1," Well, possible for the Halfhand."
5166,SAM,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1," Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here."
5167,DOLOROUS EDD,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, (to GRENN) There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.
5168,MAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, About time you did something. At least you'll keep warm.
5169,SAM,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1," The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men."
5170,DOLOROUS EDD,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1," Before I die, please, stop talking."
5171,SAM,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1," Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?"
5172,DOLOROUS EDD,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
5173,GRENN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, (laughs)
5174,JON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
5175,GRENN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, Wildlings?
5176,JON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
5177,DOLOROUS EDD,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1," So you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes."
5178,SAM,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1," And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times."
5179,GRENN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1," But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?"
5180,SAM,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, Well I read it in a book.
5181,DOLOROUS EDD,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, I read it in a book.
5182,JON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1, Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.
5183,HAYLENE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1"," Take care, my lord."
5184,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1"," I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, ""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. """
5185,HAYLENE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1"," Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow."
5186,HAYLENE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1"," After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power."
5187,BRONN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1", (scoffs)
5188,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1", My companion takes issue.
5189,BRONN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1", If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
5190,HAYLENE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1", Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
5191,BRONN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1", To do what?
5192,HAYLENE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1", The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
5193,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1", How much do you have?
5194,BRONN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1"," If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father."
5195,HAYLENE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1"," My lord, this man is insulting."
5196,BRONN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1"," I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down."
5197,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1", My friend remains unconvinced.
5198,HAYLENE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1", He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
5199,BRONN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1"," Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks."
5200,HAYLENE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1"," We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both."
5201,BRONN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1", This is a shit idea.
5202,TYRION,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1"," I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me."
5203,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, Dracarys. Dracarys.
5204,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, He'll be able to feed himself from now on.
5205,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1," Let him sleep, Doreah."
5206,DOREAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1," Yes, Khaleesi."
5207,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, (amused) He loves you.
5208,IRRI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, (Dothraki) I rewove this part of the top. And I fixed the heel on this one.
5209,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1," Thank you, my friend."
5210,DOREAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.
5211,IRRI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, It is known.
5212,DOREAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos-
5213,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1," The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo."
5214,IRRI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, (Dothraki) May he ride forever through the night lands.
5215,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1," Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy."
5216,DOREAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, (chuckles) You would look like a real princess in Xaro's-
5217,IRRI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1," She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi. You should wear it, Khaleesi."
5218,IRRI,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, You are their guest. It would be rude not to.
5219,WOMAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, And you must visit the night market. The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.
5220,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, It sounds wonderful.
5221,WOMAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, The Meereenis think they have a night market. I will take you there myself.
5222,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, Please excuse me for a moment.
5223,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, (speaks Dothraki)
5224,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, What are they doing?
5225,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1," Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry."
5226,KOVARRO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, (Dothraki) Or melt it. Very simple.
5227,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, (Dothraki)  We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
5228,KOVARRO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1," (Dothraki) Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave."
5229,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, (Dothraki) Not even when we leave.
5230,KOVARRO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, (Dothraki) Why not?
5231,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, (Dothraki) Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
5232,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
5233,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.
5234,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
5235,PYATT PREE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1," Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration?"
5236,PYATT PREE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once.
5237,PYATT PREE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1," Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons."
5238,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, My apologies. Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
5239,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, What is the House of the Undying?
5240,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1," It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic."
5241,QUAITHE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, You watch over her.
5242,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, Do I know you?
5243,QUAITHE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
5244,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1, Who are you?
5245,QUAITHE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1," I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power."
5246,BRIENNE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", It looked like Stannis.
5247,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.
5248,BRIENNE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", In the shape of Stannis.
5249,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",  We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
5250,BRIENNE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1"," Will you stay there long, my lady?"
5251,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1"," Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long."
5252,BRIENNE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", I never knew my mother.
5253,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", I'm sorry.
5254,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.
5255,BRIENNE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", It's a bloody business.
5256,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", What comes after is even harder.
5257,BRIENNE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1"," Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?"
5258,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", You mean to kill Stannis.
5259,BRIENNE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", I swore a vow.
5260,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
5261,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.
5262,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.
5263,BRIENNE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", I only held him that once as he was dying.
5264,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1"," He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well."
5265,BRIENNE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1"," I do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis."
5266,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1"," When the time comes, I will not hold you back."
5267,BRIENNE,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1"," Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new."
5268,CATELYN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",  I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
5269,WINTERFELL SHEPHERD,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1"," And it's not just thieves, my lord. There's wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen. They come down in the night and they kill my sheep. My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord. They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home. I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night."
5270,BRAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.
5271,WINTERFELL SHEPHERD,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1"," My wife always prayed for more children. We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord. And may the gods bless you and yours."
5272,BRAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1"," (to RICKON) Stop it. If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark."
5273,LUWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", Good.
5274,BRAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", Hodor.
5275,HODOR,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", Hodor.
5276,RODRIK,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", Bran! Lord Stark. Torrhen's Square is under siege.
5277,LUWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", Torrhen's Square is barely forty leagues from here. How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
5278,RODRIK,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain. Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.
5279,BRAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", We have to help them.
5280,RODRIK,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1"," Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather two hundred decent men."
5281,LUWIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1", Do you need so many?
5282,BRAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1"," If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need."
5283,RODRIK,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1"," Won't take long, my lord. Southerners don't do well up here."
5284,BRAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3," So, what does it mean?"
5285,OSHA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3, Ask your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time.
5286,BRAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3, I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.
5287,OSHA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3," Must not mean anything, then."
5288,BRAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3, You're lying.
5289,OSHA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3," You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar."
5290,BRAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3, You know what it means.
5291,OSHA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3, I never said I didn't.
5292,BRAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3, You didn't give me an honest answer.
5293,OSHA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3, That's not the same as being a liar.
5294,BRAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3," Well, it's not far off."
5295,OSHA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3," So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream. Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream?"
5296,OSHA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3," Something bad? Tell me, boy."
5297,BRAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3," I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell. I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls. It flooded the castle. Drowned men were floating here, in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them."
5298,OSHA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3, The sea is hundreds of miles away.
5299,BRAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3, I know. It's just a stupid dream.
5300,OSHA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3, I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen. Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.
5301,BRAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3," Osha. The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?"
5302,OSHA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3, They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.
5303,QHORIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, There.
5304,JEOR,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Where?
5305,QHORIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, On that mountain.
5306,SAM,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, I don't see very well.
5307,JON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, A fire.
5308,QHORIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," There's a fire. The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine. When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal. Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor."
5309,JEOR,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, How many wildlings have joined him?
5310,QHORIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," From what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move."
5311,JON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,  Where?
5312,QHORIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Somewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.
5313,JEOR,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, You saying we should fall back to the Wall?
5314,QHORIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," Mance was one of us once. Now he's one of them. He's going to teach them our way of doing things. They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back. They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us. So we need to be more like them, do things their way. Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. And to do that"
5315,JEOR,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, We need to get rid of those lookouts.
5316,QHORIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," It's not a job for 400 men. I need to move fast and silent. Harker, Stonesnake, Borba."
5317,JON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin."
5318,QHORIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin. You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger."
5319,JON,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?
5320,QHORIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,  He's the one?
5321,JEOR,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
5322,QHORIN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," Craster? In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat."
5323,SAM,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble."
5324,JEOR,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward. Go on."
5325,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?"
5326,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend.
5327,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Unlikely. I can almost always tell what a man wants.
5328,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, And what about what a woman wants?
5329,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?"
5330,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
5331,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Why?
5332,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.
5333,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
5334,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
5335,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," Ah, a conqueror."
5336,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
5337,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo."
5338,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious."
5339,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, (chuckles)
5340,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why?"
5341,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, I will show you why.
5342,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark. I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key.
5343,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, And behind the door?
5344,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, (chuckles)
5345,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, And it can all be mine?
5346,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies. Enough to go home."
5347,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, All I have to do?
5348,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Is marry me.
5349,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, That was a romantic proposal.
5350,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses."
5351,XARO,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead."
5352,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it...
5353,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country.
5354,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros."
5355,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, The usurper is dead.
5356,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, (laughs)
5357,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other."
5358,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
5359,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
5360,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way."
5361,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now."
5362,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, but you musT-"
5363,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Do not speak to me like I'm a child.
5364,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, I only want-
5365,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,  What do you want? Tell me.
5366,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, To see you on the Iron Throne.
5367,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,  Why?
5368,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real."
5369,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," So what would you have me do, as my advisor?"
5370,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1," Make your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth."
5371,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, And how do I get the ship?
5372,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain.
5373,DAENERYS,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, I look forward to meeting him.
5374,JORAH,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Khaleesi.
5375,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, You should stand sideface.
5376,GENDRY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Sideface?
5377,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Sideways.
5378,GENDRY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Why?
5379,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Smaller target.
5380,GENDRY,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Am I fighting someone?
5381,ARYA,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, You're practicing for a fight. You should practice right.
5382,GOLD CLOAK,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Guards! Did you see anything? Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.
5383,GOLD CLOAK,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Go up the battlement.
5384,WOMAN,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, That is strange.
5385,GOLD CLOAK,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1, Move away. Stand back. He's dead.Embed
5386,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, I've taken your castle.
5387,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, Theon?
5388,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.
5389,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, Why?
5390,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, To take the castle.
5391,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, You went with Robb.
5392,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?
5393,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, I don't know.
5394,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, Find the halfwit.
5395,DAGMER,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, (nods)
5396,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.
5397,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, Why?
5398,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
5399,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, I won't.
5400,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1," Yes, you will."
5401,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, I won't. I'll never yield. We'll fight you and throw you out.
5402,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1," The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say."
5403,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1, Theon. Did you hate us the whole time?
5404,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.
5405,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, Louder. Say Prince Theon.
5406,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me.
5407,FARLEN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit."
5408,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," Farlen, you be silent."
5409,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do."
5410,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, All of you should do as he commands.
5411,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.
5412,FARLEN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with it-
5413,IRONBORN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, Shut up!
5414,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?"
5415,LUWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, I am.
5416,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens.
5417,LUWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, My lord.
5418,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, My Lord Greyjoy.
5419,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.
5420,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, You were here the day I was taken.
5421,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, I'm the one who took you. What of it?
5422,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, Let me serve you.
5423,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts."
5424,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again.
5425,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.
5426,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, Step aside.
5427,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, Why?
5428,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," It's your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain't letting it drown me."
5429,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, You'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time-
5430,BLACK LORREN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, Greyjoy!
5431,BLACK LORREN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword.
5432,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes."
5433,RODRIK,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people.
5434,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, They are not my people.
5435,RODRIK,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, King Robb thought of you as a brother.
5436,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you."
5437,RODRIK,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons."
5438,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home."
5439,RODRIK,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, If he were alive to see this
5440,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.
5441,RODRIK,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.
5442,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," You've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll-"
5443,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, Take him to the cells. Lock him up
5444,DAGMER,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, My prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay.
5445,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.
5446,DAGMER,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," No, he has to pay the iron price. They'll never respect you while he lives."
5447,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death!"
5448,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.
5449,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.
5450,LUWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, I urge you not to make a hasty decision.
5451,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine."
5452,LUWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do."
5453,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.
5454,DAGMER,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, Come.
5455,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, No! No! Theon! Please. Ser Rodrik!
5456,RODRIK,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
5457,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, I'm begging you.
5458,RODRIK,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, Coward.
5459,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, Stop. Stop! Stop right now!
5460,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," You don't give commands anymore, little lord."
5461,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," Please, stop this. Please stop him."
5462,RODRIK,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," Hush now, child. I'm off to see your father."
5463,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please."
5464,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," Any last words, old man?"
5465,RODRIK,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost."
5466,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," Theon, please don't."
5467,RICKON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5, Do something!
5468,BRAN,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5," I'll do anything, please! No, please stop it!"
5469,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3," Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!"
5470,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3, There goes your pet.
5471,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3, He's not a pet.
5472,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3," No, you're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing."
5473,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3, Ghost is different.
5474,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3," So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night."
5475,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3, I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
5476,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3, I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.
5477,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3, We could do the same.
5478,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3," No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it."
5479,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3, My father always said I'm of the North.
5480,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3, (laughs)
5481,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3, I wasn't joking.
5482,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3," Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?"
5483,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3, (nods)
5484,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3," No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life."
5485,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3, I'll gladly give my life.
5486,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3," I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?"
5487,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3, I do.
5488,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3," You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us."
5489,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, Can you read?
5490,AMORY,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, My lord?
5491,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, Can you read?
5492,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
5493,AMORY,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," My apologies, my lord. I must have-"
5494,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this-"
5495,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, My cupbearer can read better than you.
5496,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
5497,ARMORY,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," My lord, I-"
5498,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have twenty thousand men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us."
5499,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it."
5500,GUARD,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, Lord Petyr Baelish.
5501,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, Mmm. Give us the room.
5502,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, (to Arya) Clear all this.
5503,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, Lord Tywin.
5504,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, (not amused) Baelish.
5505,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, Wine?
5506,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, Thank you.
5507,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, What news from the capital?
5508,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
5509,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear."
5510,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.
5511,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
5512,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
5513,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?"
5514,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers."
5515,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"  Yes, yes, yes."
5516,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery-
5517,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, Wants to be queen.
5518,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," Yes, she does."
5519,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.
5520,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated."
5521,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, (to Arya) More wine for Lord Baelish.
5522,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement TYWIN"
5523,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, They have.
5524,ARYA,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," Pardon, my lord."
5525,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, It's only wine.
5526,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, You would ride there yourself?
5527,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," Tonight, with your leave."
5528,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl."
5529,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, And what else?
5530,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1," On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark."
5531,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, Why?
5532,LITTLEFINGER,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
5533,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1, Hmm.
5534,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, A girl.
5535,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, A wildling.
5536,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, We could question her.
5537,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, You could. She won't answer. I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.
5538,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, What's your name?
5539,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, Ygritte.
5540,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1," She was reaching for this ax when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face."
5541,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, I gave you my name.
5542,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, I'm Jon Snow.
5543,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, You ought to burn them you killed.
5544,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1," We'd need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area?"
5545,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.
5546,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, Our boy here's already killed one dead man. He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass?
5547,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, The Free Folk.
5548,QHORIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, How many?
5549,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1," Hundreds and thousands. More than you've ever seen, crow."

5566,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, You can't do it. We both know it.
5567,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1," The sun's going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close."
5568,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1, I'll find them.

5640,HOUND,2,16,the old gods and the new,RED KEEP INTERIOR_1, I didn't do it for you.
5641,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", He shouldn't make me wait.
5642,XARO,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth."
5643,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", I already have a husband.
5644,XARO,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful."
5645,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.
5646,XARO,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," I have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery."
5647,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", The Mother of Dragons!
5648,XARO,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," Ah, here he comes."
5649,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night. Terrible dreams. I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself."
5650,XARO,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself."
5651,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I'll have them flogged in the square."
5652,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want."
5653,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want?"
5654,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
5655,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have.
5656,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships.
5657,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another."
5658,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.
5659,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
5660,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," My father sat there, before he was murdered."
5661,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say ""take the Iron Throne""?"
5662,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", I didn't come here to argue grammar.
5663,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army?"
5664,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", Not yet.
5665,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?
5666,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", There are many there that support my claim.
5667,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", When were you there last?
5668,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", I left when I was a baby.
5669,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," So, in truth, you have no allies."
5670,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.
5671,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," Ah. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you'll pardon me."
5672,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met."
5673,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", A shrewd man.
5674,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons."
5675,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1", Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.
5676,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess."
5677,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it."
5678,SPICE KING,2,16,the old gods and the new,"MEREEN, COURTYARD, DAY_1"," Yes, my lady, but not with my ships."
5679,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,"HARRENHAL, COUNCIL CHAMBER, DUSK_1", Who taught you to read?
5680,ARYA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"HARRENHAL, COUNCIL CHAMBER, DUSK_1"," My father, my lord."
5681,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,"HARRENHAL, COUNCIL CHAMBER, DUSK_1"," Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?"
5682,ARYA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"HARRENHAL, COUNCIL CHAMBER, DUSK_1", A stonemason.
5683,TWYIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,"HARRENHAL, COUNCIL CHAMBER, DUSK_1", A stonemason who could read? Hmm.
5684,ARYA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"HARRENHAL, COUNCIL CHAMBER, DUSK_1", He taught himself.
5685,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,"HARRENHAL, COUNCIL CHAMBER, DUSK_1", Quite a man. What killed him?
5686,ARYA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"HARRENHAL, COUNCIL CHAMBER, DUSK_1", Loyalty.

5688,ARYA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"HARRENHAL, COUNCIL CHAMBER, DUSK_1"," Did... Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn't ask questions."
5689,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,"HARRENHAL, COUNCIL CHAMBER, DUSK_1", No. But you've already begun.
5690,ARYA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"HARRENHAL, COUNCIL CHAMBER, DUSK_1"," Did you know your father, my lord?"
5691,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,"HARRENHAL, COUNCIL CHAMBER, DUSK_1", I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old.
5692,TYWIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,"HARRENHAL, COUNCIL CHAMBER, DUSK_1"," He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I'm cold."
5693,ARYA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"HARRENHAL, COUNCIL CHAMBER, DUSK_1"," I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord."

5697,AMORY,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3, Why?
5698,ARYA,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3, Lord Tywin sent me.
5699,AMORY,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3, What might this be?
5700,ARYA,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3, Lord Tywin gave it to me.
5701,AMORY,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3, What for?
5702,ARYA,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3, To take to the armory.
5703,AMORY,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3, Why would he do that? Let's go and ask him.
5704,AMORY,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3, Move! Get out of the way!
5705,ARYA,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3, Amory Lorch.

5707,ARYA,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3, Now!
5708,JAQEN,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3, A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.

5714,SOLDIER #3,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1," My honor, Your Grace."
5715,SOLDIER #4,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Your Grace.
5716,QUENT,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Your Grace.
5717,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Quent.
5718,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Lady Talisa.
5719,TALISA,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Your Grace. I'm not sure I'm a lady. Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.
5720,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1," It's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows."
5721,TALISA,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?
5722,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Because it's obvious.
5723,TALISA,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1," What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother, and I lived with him above our shop?"
5724,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, I'd call you a liar.
5725,TALISA,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.
5726,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, (nods)
5727,TALISA,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, I always thought I was a brilliant liar.
5728,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1," Better at amputations, I'm afraid."
5729,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Quite a pretty spot.
5730,TALISA,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Will we be here long?
5731,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.
5732,TALISA,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, I'm not a spy.
5733,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1," Of course, a spy would deny being a spy."
5734,TALISA,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1," You're right. You've found me out. I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters. ""The Young Wolf is on the move. """
5735,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1," Perhaps you'd join me... If you've got time, of course, for, well-"
5736,CATELYN,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Robb.
5737,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1," Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She's been helping with the wounded. She's been very... helpful."
5738,CATELYIN,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Lady Talisa.
5739,TALISA,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Lady Stark.
5740,CATELYN,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Lady Talisa...?
5741,TALISA,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Maegyr.
5742,CATELYN,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1," Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name."
5743,TALISA,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1," An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace."
5744,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, I've missed you.
5745,CATELYN,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1," Yes, you look positively forlorn."
5746,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1," You surprised me, that's all. I didn't think I'd see you today."
5747,CATELYN,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, I wish that you were free to follow your heart.
5748,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, I know.
5749,CATELYN,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, You have inherited your father's responsibilities. I'm afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another.
5750,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, I know.
5751,CATELYN,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, A debt that must be paid.
5752,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, I haven't forgotten.
5753,ROOSE BOLTON,2,16,the old gods and the new,THE STARK WAR CAMP._1, Your Grace. My lady. News from Winterfell.
5754,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go.
5755,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.
5756,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, Here? There's no shelter here.
5757,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, There's no shelter anywhere.
5758,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, There is if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire-
5759,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, No fire.
5760,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, But a fire is-
5761,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, No fire.
5762,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, Have it your way.
5763,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, We'll stay warmer if we stay close.
5764,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life.
5765,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, Think they're out looking for you?
5766,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, Yes.
5767,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, Think they'll find you?
5768,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, Yes.
5769,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5," You're brave. Stupid, but brave."
5770,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, We start again at first light. Get some sleep.
5771,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, Stop moving.
5772,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, I'm just trying to get comfortable.
5773,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, Stop it!
5774,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, You're still moving.
5775,YGRITTE,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, Was I? I didn't notice that time.
5776,JON,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5, (sighs)
5777,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, This cannot be true.
5778,ROOSE,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I'm afraid it is true."
5779,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Why? Why would Theon-
5780,ROOSE,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.
5781,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, My brothers?
5782,ROOSE,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  We've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
5783,CATELYN,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!"
5784,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, I must go north at once.
5785,ROOSE,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," There's still a war to win, Your Grace."
5786,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't-
5787,ROOSE,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, You are a king. And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.
5788,CATELYN,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Let me go and talk to Theon.
5789,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, There will be no talk. He will die for this.
5790,ROOSE,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head."
5791,ROBB,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself."
5792,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5, Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
5793,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5, I'm no liar.
5794,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5, All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.
5795,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5," I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord."
5796,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5, How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.
5797,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5," There are other ways to serve, my lord."
5798,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5," I'm a prince now, and you'd do well-"
5799,AHSA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5," There are other ways to serve, my prince."
5800,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5, Like what?
5801,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5," We know things, the free people."
5802,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5, You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?
5803,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5, Other things.
5804,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5, Savage things.
5805,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5, Wait outside.
5806,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5, I always wondered what you had under there.
5807,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5, It comes at a price.
5808,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5, I'm not killing you. That's your price.
5809,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5, I already had that.
5810,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5," What do you want then, other than your miserable life?"
5811,AHSA,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5, What all free people want. My freedom.
5812,THEON,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5," Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well."
5813,SANSA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1", Ow!
5814,SHAE,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1", Shh. It's not deep.
5815,SANSA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1", I thought they were going to kill me.
5816,SHAE,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1"," They thought so, too."
5817,SANSA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1"," He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me."
5818,SHAE,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",  Of course he did.
5819,SANSA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1", Why? Why would a stranger-
5820,SHAE,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1", You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead.
5821,SANSA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1", I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them.
5822,SHAE,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1", Don't say these things. If the wrong people hear you-
5823,SANSA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1", But you're not the wrong people.
5824,SHAE,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1", Don't trust anybody. Life is safer that way.
5825,GUARD,2,16,the old gods and the new,"WINTERFELL, NIGHT_1", And where are you going?
5826,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"WINTERFELL, NIGHT_1", I have something for you from Prince Theon.
5827,GUARD,2,16,the old gods and the new,"WINTERFELL, NIGHT_1", What?
5828,OSHA,2,16,the old gods and the new,"WINTERFELL, NIGHT_1", Me. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm.
5829,DAENERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"QARTH, GARDEN PATH_1", The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
5830,XARO,2,16,the old gods and the new,"QARTH, GARDEN PATH_1"," When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets."
5831,XARO,2,16,the old gods and the new,"QARTH, GARDEN PATH_1"," Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi."
5832,DANAERYS,2,16,the old gods and the new,"QARTH, GARDEN PATH_1", Where are they? Where are my dragons?
5833,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_7," A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?"
5834,BLACK LORREN,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_7, The giant must have took him.
5835,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_7," The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?"
5836,BLACK LORREN,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_7," Gone, along with the wildling woman. The one you were fucking."
5837,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_7, Right. Get the horses and the hounds.
5838,DAGMER,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_7, (laughs)
5839,MAN,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1," Come on, find the scent. Where they going?"
5840,DAGMER,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, Halt!
5841,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, Enjoying your first hunt?
5842,LUWIN,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1," So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord."
5843,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1," With hunting, there's blood at the end."
5844,LUWIN,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, They're little boys.
5845,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1," I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them."
5846,LUWIN,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.
5847,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, They have no value to me missing.
5848,LUWIN,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
5849,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1," Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000."
5850,MAN,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1,  We have a scent!
5851,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1," The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game."
5852,OSHA,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3, We should have took more food.
5853,BRAN,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3, We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.
5854,OSHA,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3, Those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed.
5855,BRAN,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3," And if Theon found out, he'd hang them."
5856,OSHA,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3, The boy can't survive on walnuts.
5857,RICKON,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3, I'm fine.
5858,OSHA,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3, We've been walking since before sunrise. Even Hodor will tire.
5859,HODOR,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3, Hodor.
5860,OSHA,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3," Even you, sweet giant."
5861,HODOR,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3, Hodor.
5862,BRAN,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3," Wait, I know that farm. I sent those two Winterfell orphans there."
5863,RICKON,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3, Jack and Billy. They'll give us some food.
5864,BRAN,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3," We can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are."
5865,RIKON,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3, Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.
5866,OSHA,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3," You've never seen me climb a tree, little man."
5867,BRAN,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3, They'll be after us with hounds.
5868,OSHA,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_3," We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever."
5869,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, Did you pull a knife on me in the night?
5870,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.
5871,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, Let's move.
5872,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7," It is the first time. How old are you, boy?"
5873,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
5874,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets-
5875,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, Don't call them that.
5876,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7," What, stones? Or bone?"
5877,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, Neither. Both.
5878,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, Move!
5879,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7," I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?"
5880,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7," There are no women of the Night's Watch, no."
5881,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, So the lads just do it with each other?
5882,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, No.
5883,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, Never?
5884,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, Never. We swore an oath.
5885,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7," You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable."
5886,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, Would you please shut up?
5887,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7," Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman."
5888,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, You're a free woman?
5889,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7," I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman."
5890,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7," If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what ""prisoner"" means."
5891,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
5892,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, It was my choice to say the words.
5893,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, So you don't like girls?
5894,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, Of course I like girls.
5895,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, But you chose never to touch them.
5896,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
5897,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7," So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands-"
5898,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7," Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!"
5899,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
5900,JON,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7," My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours."
5901,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7, So why are you fighting us?
5902,MAN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," Go on. Now I want you to tell me what happened. Come on, this way. Come on, speak up. Speak up."
5903,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.
5904,MOUNTIAN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, We hanged twenty men last night.
5905,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, I don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
5906,THE MOUNTAIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
5907,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one."
5908,THE MOUNTAIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence."
5909,TWYIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side."
5910,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Mmm. Is that mutton?
5911,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," Yes, my lord."
5912,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Don't like mutton.
5913,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, I'll bring something else.
5914,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Leave it. Are you hungry?
5915,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, No.
5916,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Of course you are. Eat.
5917,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, I'll eat in the kitchen later.
5918,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer. Sit. Eat.
5919,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
5920,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, I eat a lot. I just don't grow.
5921,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.
5922,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Have you ever lost before?
5923,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
5924,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, (shakes her head)
5925,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months."
5926,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.
5927,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?"
5928,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Dragons?
5929,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Yes. Dragons happened.
5930,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name"
5931,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Aegon and his sisters.
5932,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Mmm?
5933,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too."
5934,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," Correct. A student of history, are you?"
5935,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
5936,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
5937,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
5938,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?"
5939,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, (smiles)
5940,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
5941,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Most girls are idiots.
5942,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
5943,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, From my father.
5944,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
5945,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?"
5946,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want."
5947,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," And, girl."
5948,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," ""M'lord."""
5949,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," Lowborn girls say ""m'lord,"" not ""my lord. "" If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly."
5950,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3," My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly."
5951,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?
5952,ARYA,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Yes.
5953,TYWIN,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3, Go on.
5954,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1," I beg pardon, ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. You were so brave."
5955,THE HOUND,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1, Brave? A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.
5956,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1, Does it give you joy to scare people?
5957,THE HOUND,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1," No, it gives me joy to kill people."
5958,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1, (gasps)
5959,THE HOUND,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1, Spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.
5960,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1, It was his duty. He never liked it.
5961,THE HOUND,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1, Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is.
5962,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1, Why are you always so hateful?
5963,THE HOUND,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1, You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king.
5964,XARO,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1, I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen. One of them did this or knows who did.
5965,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1, You are one of the Thirteen.
5966,XARO,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1," If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them. They mean nothing to me on their own."
5967,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1, Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.
5968,XARO,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1, Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.
5969,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1," There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?"
5970,XARO,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1," I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof."
5971,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1, But it did happen under your roof.
5972,XARO,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1," Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been-"
5973,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1, I don't care where you've been.
5974,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_1," You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was."
5975,JON,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_1," No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall."
5976,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_1," We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night."
5977,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_1, You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.
5978,JON,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_1, Walk.
5979,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_1, I could teach you how to do it.
5980,JON,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_1, I know how to do it.
5981,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_1," You know nothing, Jon Snow."
5982,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", And what did she say?
5983,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1"," She admired your spirit, Your Grace."
5984,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", And what then?
5985,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1"," She, uh..."
5986,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1"," If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang."
5987,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1"," She tore the paper in half, Your Grace."
5988,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1"," You've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper."
5989,RICKARD KARSTARK,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1"," Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace. The prisoners from the Yellow Fork."
5990,ROOSE,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", Too many prisoners.
5991,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", Is there room for Ser Alton?
5992,RICKARD KARSTARK,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", Does he need to lie down?
5993,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.
5994,RICKARD KARSTARK,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", Torrhen.
5995,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", That will be all.
5996,TALISA,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", Your Grace. A minute of your time?
5997,TALISA,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", I've been treating your wounded men.
5998,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1"," And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning."
5999,TALISA,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", They're not my enemies.
6000,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", That's what I tell my bannermen.
6001,TALISA,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1"," I've already run through the supplies I brought with me. Some are easily replaced. Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses."
6002,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", But some are not.
6003,TALISA,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", I need silk for stitching.
6004,TALISA,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1"," I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy. You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any. I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over."
6005,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", If you need help finding these-
6006,TALISA,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1"," I know where to find them. I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you."
6007,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1"," Continue, my lady."
6008,TALISA,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?
6009,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", Yes.
6010,TALISA,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need.
6011,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", I expect he will.
6012,TALISA,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", If I could write a list-
6013,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", Come with me to the Crag.
6014,TALISA,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1", I don't think that will be-
6015,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1"," Let the maester show you his stores. I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men."
6016,WOMAN,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1," Children, come inside, quick. Come on."
6017,CHILD,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, Hurry up!
6018,MAN,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1," Can't find anything, ser. They've lost the scent."
6019,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, Try again.
6020,MAN,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, We've circled this farmhouse twice. There's no sign of them.
6021,LUWIN,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1," We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord."
6022,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1," I'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak."
6023,MAN #2,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, Prince Theon.
6024,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, Where are they?
6025,WINTERFELL SHEPHERD,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1," Who, m'lord?"
6026,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, The Stark boys. Where are they?
6027,WINTERFELL SHEPHERD,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, I don't know. I seen no one.
6028,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, Think harder.
6029,WINTERFELL SHEPHERD,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1," I swear, m'lord. I don't know."
6030,DAGMER,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1," My lord, over here. I think I've found what we're looking for."
6031,DAGMER,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, Send the old man home.
6032,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, (nods)
6033,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1, Go back to Winterfell. Take him back.
6034,LUWIN,2,17,a man without honor,FARM OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1," Theon, don't do this."
6035,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", You came back.
6036,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", As soon as I heard. Do you know anything?
6037,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", Irri is dead.
6038,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", I know. She was a good-
6039,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.
6040,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", Doreah?
6041,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1"," We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse."
6042,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", I should have been here.
6043,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", You went to find me a ship.
6044,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", My place is by your side. I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.
6045,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1"," ""These people""?"
6046,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", They are not to be trusted.
6047,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1"," And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse."
6048,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", Your people are in Westeros.
6049,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.
6050,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", They will soon enough.
6051,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.
6052,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1"," You are not your brother. Trust me, Khaleesi."
6053,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1"," There it is. ""Trust me. "" And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it."
6054,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", You are too young to be so-
6055,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", And you are too familiar.
6056,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1"," Forgive me, Khaleesi. No one can survive in this world without help. No one. Let me help you, please. Tell me how."
6057,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS_1", Find my dragons.
6058,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3, How long till we get back to your crows?
6059,JON,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3, We're close.
6060,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3," What, a day? A half-day? You don't know, do you? Do you even know where they are?"
6061,JON,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3, We're close.
6062,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3, What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?
6063,JON,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3, Nothing happened between you and me.
6064,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3," ""I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth. And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined. The shame of it. Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. What will me poor savage father say?"""
6065,JON,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3, Turn back around.
6066,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3," ""And I thought that we were done, but he said, ''Turn back around.'"" I'll tell you what, Jon Snow. Since it's gonna be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just-"
6067,JON,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3," What, right here in the muck?"
6068,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3, I'll keep you warm enough.
6069,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3, Are you that afraid of it?
6070,JON,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3, That's enough.
6071,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3, It's nice and wet and warm.
6072,JON,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3, Enough!
6073,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3, It don't have teeth.
6074,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3,"  All right! All right. Gods, you're dull."
6075,YGRITTE,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_3, Should have took me while you had the chance.
6076,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_3," No, no!"
6077,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_3," No. Oh, no."
6078,SHAE,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_3, It's all right. Give me that.
6079,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_3," If the Queen sees, I can have Joffrey's children now."
6080,SHAE,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_3, Help me flip it over.
6081,SHAE,2,17,a man without honor,DARK HALLWAY_1, Where are you going?
6082,HANDMAIDEN,2,17,a man without honor,DARK HALLWAY_1,  To tell Her Grace.
6083,SHAE,2,17,a man without honor,DARK HALLWAY_1, You'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand?
6084,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1," Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more."
6085,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1," My mother told me, but I thought it would be different."
6086,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1, In what way?
6087,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1, I thought it would be less messy.
6088,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1, Wait until you birth a child.
6089,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1, You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?
6090,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1, I'm fit to bear children for the king?
6091,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1," A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen."
6092,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1, (nods)
6093,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1," Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood."
6094,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1, His Grace was not with you?
6095,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1," Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion."
6096,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1," You may never love the king, but you will love his children."
6097,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1, I love His Grace with all my heart.
6098,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1," That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice."
6099,SANSA,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1," But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?"
6100,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,CERSEI'S ROOM_1," You can try, little dove."
6101,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", Who did you say your mother was again?
6102,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", Cinda Lannister.
6103,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", Is she the fat one?
6104,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she-"
6105,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it."
6106,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," I squired for you once, you know."
6107,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", When?
6108,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding."
6109,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", I went to Willem Frey's wedding?
6110,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", You did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.
6111,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?
6112,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", Bryan.
6113,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Poor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before."
6114,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," That's right. I ran up and volunteered. ""Let me, my lord. Let me."" My father was furious. Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family."
6115,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," You didn't, though."
6116,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", You really remember?
6117,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them."
6118,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", When I think back to that day-
6119,GUARD,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", Shh!
6120,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", You were saying?
6121,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", I- Never mind. It's embarrassing.
6122,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
6123,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about."
6124,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", I understand completely.
6125,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you."
6126,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice."
6127,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", Which knight was it?
6128,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
6129,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", What was he like?
6130,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
6131,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", It's hard to put into words.
6132,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life."
6133,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", (nods) Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
6134,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", Did you squire for him again?
6135,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire."
6136,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", (smiles)
6137,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint."
6138,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", And have you thought about
6139,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", Of course. Every day.
6140,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", And?
6141,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful."
6142,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", (nods)
6143,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now."
6144,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", What is it?
6145,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", It's actually quite simple.
6146,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Well, let me help you."
6147,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", You'll only have to do one thing.
6148,ALTON,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", Tell me.
6149,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1", (whispers)You'll have to die.
6150,QUAITH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, GARDEN_1", Jorah the Andal. This man must sail past old Valyria. All who travel too close to the doom must have protection.
6151,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, GARDEN_1", I didn't come here for lessons.
6152,QUAITH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, GARDEN_1"," No, you came for the dragons."
6153,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, GARDEN_1", You have them? Where are they?
6154,QUAITH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, GARDEN_1", Draw your sword. See what your steel is worth. You want to please the Mother of Dragons.
6155,QUAITH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, GARDEN_1", You love her.
6156,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, GARDEN_1", Where are the dragons?
6157,QUAITH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, GARDEN_1"," Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?"
6158,QUAITH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, GARDEN_1", Will you betray her again?
6159,JORAH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, GARDEN_1", Never.
6160,QUAITH,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, GARDEN_1", The thief you seek is with her now.
6161,SPICE KING,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1", I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.
6162,XARO,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1", No one is calling you a thief. Who is she to accuse us?
6163,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1"," Please, they're my children. I'm begging you."
6164,SILK KING,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1", Begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.
6165,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1"," Without me, the dragons will die."
6166,SPICE KING,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1"," It will be for the best. Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear. If I knew where they were, I would not tell you."
6167,PYAT PREE,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1"," You are cruel, my friend. The Mother of Dragons is in the right. She must be reunited with her babies. I will help you, Khaleesi."
6168,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1", How?
6169,PYATT PREE,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1", I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
6170,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1", You have my dragons?
6171,PYAT PREE,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1"," When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth. He procured them for me."
6172,DAENERYS,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1", But there is no King of Qarth.
6173,XARO,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1", There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement.
6174,XARO,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1"," You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change. I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me."
6175,SPICE KING,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1"," Your ambition is an inspiration. But like all upstarts, you overreach. Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king."
6176,XARO,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1"," An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise."
6177,PYAT PREE,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1"," The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies. She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever."
6178,PYATTPREE,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1", A mother should be with her children.
6179,PYAT PREE,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1","  Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying. Come see them."
6180,JACKS,2,17,a man without honor,RIVERLANDS_3, Lady Stark!
6181,BRIENNE,2,17,a man without honor,RIVERLANDS_3, No farther.
6182,JACKS,2,17,a man without honor,RIVERLANDS_3," Keep your hands off me, woman."
6183,BRIENNE,2,17,a man without honor,RIVERLANDS_3," Don't enter without an invitation, man."
6184,JACKS,2,17,a man without honor,RIVERLANDS_3, Forgive me. Lady Stark.
6185,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,RIVERLANDS_3, What is it?
6186,JACKS,2,17,a man without honor,RIVERLANDS_3, They caught the Kingslayer.
6187,MAN,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, Kingslayer!
6188,MAN #2,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, Kill the fucking Kingslayer!
6189,MAN #3,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, Hang him!
6190,MAN #4,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, Hang him!
6191,MAN #5,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, You'll die today.
6192,MAN #6,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, Justice for the Karstark.
6193,MAN,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, Gut him!
6194,RICKARD KARSTARK,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, Get back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.
6195,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1," Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner."
6196,RICKARD,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, This monster killed my son.
6197,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1," And crippled mine. He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here."
6198,RICKARD KARSTARK,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, I will have his head. And if you try and stop me
6199,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1," You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark. I am the mother of your king!"
6200,RICKARD KARSTARK,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, And where is our king now?
6201,ROBB,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, You know very well.
6202,RICKARD KARSTARK,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1," He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender. Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate. He brought that foreign bitch with him."
6203,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, How dare you!
6204,BRIENNE,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
6205,RICKARD KARSTARK,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?
6206,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1," I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it. But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down."
6207,RICKARD KARSTARK,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1," When your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head."
6208,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, Wise men do not make demands of kings.
6209,RICKARD KARSTARK,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, Fathers who love their sons do. I will have his head.
6210,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1," Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but-"
6211,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, Take him to the stockades. Bind him with every chain you can find!
6212,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.
6213,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,THE CAMP_1, And gag him!
6214,TYRION,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, Since when do you light your own candles?
6215,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
6216,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, How many times can you read one raven scroll?
6217,TYRION,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5," Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships."
6218,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, More than we have.
6219,TYRION,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5," Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind."
6220,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5," We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above."
6221,TYRION,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5," ""Rain fire on them from above."" You're quoting Father, aren't you?"
6222,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5," Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?"
6223,TYRION,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5," Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
6224,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
6225,TYRION,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
6226,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
6227,TYRION,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, I thought the girls might help him.
6228,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, Did you?
6229,TYRION,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, I was wrong. If we can't control him
6230,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.
6231,TYRION,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
6232,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.
6233,TYRION,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, The boy is more Robert than Jaime.
6234,CESEI,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5," Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins."
6235,TYRION,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5, Sins?
6236,CERSEI,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5," The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""
6237,TYRION,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5," You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them."
6238,MAN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, Then why wait?
6239,MAN #2,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, We're sworn to the king.
6240,MAN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, There's not a king.
6241,MAN #2,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, That's treason.
6242,MAN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1," So is saving Lannisters, yeah?"
6243,MAN #2,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1," Back off, you."
6244,MAN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1," No, I won't."
6245,BRIENNE,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1," Your son returns at dawn, my lady?"
6246,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, So they say.
6247,BRIENNE,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1," The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?"
6248,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, Come.
6249,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, I need to be alone with him.
6250,GUARD,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,"  My lady, our orders-"
6251,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1," Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him."
6252,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1," Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?"
6253,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, Do you hear them out there? They want your head.
6254,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
6255,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, You strangled his son with your chains.
6256,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.
6257,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
6258,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1," So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?"
6259,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1," She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer."
6260,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1," Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back."
6261,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, You are a man without honor.
6262,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1," Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?"
6263,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, Brienne.
6264,JAIME,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1," No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman."
6265,CATELYN,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1, (to BRIENNE) Your sword.
6266,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_9, I told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not.
6267,LUWIN,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_9, What are you doing? What have you done?
6268,THEON,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_9," If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question."
6269,LUWIN,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_9, No!
6270,MAN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,Unnamed Scene_52, Riders approaching!
6271,MAR #2,2,18,the prince of winterfell,Unnamed Scene_52, Open the gate!
6272,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1," Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell."
6273,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, Envy isn't attractive.
6274,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,  What envy?
6275,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with twenty men.
6276,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1," You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?"
6277,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1," I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery."
6278,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, You treated them with honor? By butchering them?
6279,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, Before I had to kill them- I treated them-
6280,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1," You seized their home, as is your right. We're Ironborn, we take what we need."
6281,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, Exactly.
6282,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.
6283,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, They made me a promise
6284,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
6285,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, Don't call me
6286,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?
6287,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1," If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak."
6288,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, You are weak. And you're stupid.
6289,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, I'm warning you.
6290,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1," Go on, then. Warn me."
6291,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
6292,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, You're not. I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word.
6293,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.
6294,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1," Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out-"
6295,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.
6296,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, (to her men) Leave us.
6297,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1," Theon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother. We both endured our father. Come home with me. Don't die here alone."
6298,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1, I don't intend to die.
6299,YARA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1," You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea."
6300,YGRITTE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9," I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones."
6301,LORD OF BONES,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9, I already got one crow. Don't need two.
6302,YGRITTE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9, Mance will want to question this one. Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.
6303,LORD OF BONES,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9, The Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy. Gut him.
6304,YGRITTE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9, He could have killed me half a dozen times.
6305,LORD OF BONES,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9, And now he wishes he did. Gut him.
6306,YGRITTE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9," He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son."
6307,YGRITTE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9, Mance will want him.
6308,LORD OF BONES,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9, What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard?
6309,YGRITTE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9, I don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself.
6310,LORD OF BONES,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9," He runs, I'll chop his balls off."
6311,YGRITTE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9," He runs, I'll do it meself."
6312,YGRITTE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9," We're even now, Jon Snow."
6313,JON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9," I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-"
6314,QHORIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9, I know.
6315,JON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9, The others?
6316,QHORIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9," When you didn't come back, we went looking for you. We found your tracks fast enough. But they found us before we found you."
6317,JON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9, They died because of me.
6318,QHORIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9, See that it wasn't for nothing.
6319,WILDLING,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9," All right, up, lad."
6320,WILDLING #2,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9," Come on, on your feet, now. Move it."
6321,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, Is she beautiful?
6322,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,  I've never met her.
6323,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, What's her name?
6324,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1," Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name."
6325,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, I'm sure you'll be very happy.
6326,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, And you're marrying her for a bridge?
6327,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, An important bridge.
6328,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, Ah.
6329,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1," It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge."
6330,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1," When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father."
6331,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1," He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but"
6332,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1," Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me."
6333,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1," He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me."
6334,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, I wish I could have met him.
6335,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, He would have liked you.
6336,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, (chuckles) Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
6337,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, He didn't care much about gold or glory.
6338,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,  And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. I want the men following me to go home.
6339,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, Then why don't you?
6340,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.
6341,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1," Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean."
6342,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, That would be a start.
6343,RIDER,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1," Your Grace, milady. The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night."
6344,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, How? How?
6345,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1, Tell me this isn't true.
6346,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1, Why?
6347,CATELYN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1, For the girls.
6348,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1, You betrayed me.
6349,CATELYN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1, Robb-
6350,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1, No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
6351,CATELYN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1," Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free."
6352,RICKARD KARSTARK,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1," I lost one son fighting by your son's side. I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain. You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell."
6353,CATELYN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1," I grieve for your sons, my lord."
6354,RICKARD KARSTARK,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1, I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance. And you stole it from me.
6355,CATELYN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1," Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine."
6356,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1, Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.
6357,CATELYN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1, Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
6358,SOLDIER,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1," Forty, Your Grace."
6359,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1, Send another forty with our fastest horses.
6360,CATELYN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1, Robb.
6361,JAIME,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1, Damn.
6362,JAIME,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1," You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin."
6363,JAIME,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1, A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.
6364,BRIENNE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1, Brienne of Tarth.
6365,JAIME,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1," Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another."
6366,JAIME,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1, Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.
6367,JAIME,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1," I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me."
6368,BRIENNE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1," Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer."
6369,JAIME,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1, Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
6370,BRIENNE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1," You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent."
6371,JAIME,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1, Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
6372,BRIENNE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1, You will not provoke me to anger.
6373,JAIME,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1, I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
6374,BRIENNE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,  I've never seen you fight.
6375,JAIME,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1, The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.
6376,BRIENNE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1, All my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.
6377,JAIME,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1," If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens."
6378,BRINENNE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1, Do you take me for an idiot? In!
6379,JAIME,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1," I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid."
6380,BRINENNE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1," Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer."
6381,KEVAN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5, King's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force. It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.
6382,TYWIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5, Surrender the Iron Throne?
6383,KEVAN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5, Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates. Stannis will execute them all.
6384,TYWIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5," No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep."
6385,KEVAN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5, The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.
6386,TYWIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5," Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner."
6387,TWYIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5, Too close to Casterly Rock.
6388,KEVAN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5, He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell. The Greyjoys have done us a great favor. Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.
6389,TYWIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5, He's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
6390,TYWIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5," We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work."
6391,GUARD,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_5, You've got some questions to answer.
6392,MAN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_5, Who killed Ser Amory?
6393,MAN #2,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_5, I don't know! Please!
6394,MAN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_5, Give me the name. Take this one out for the crows.
6395,MAN #2,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_5," I told you, I don't know. Please."
6396,RORGE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_5," Look, it's Yoren's little cunt. Used to be a boy, now it's a girl."
6397,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_5, Where's Jaqen?
6398,RORGE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_5," Don't care. Where's your stick now, bitch? I promised to fuck you with it."
6399,GUARD,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_5," Come on, time to kill some wolves."
6400,HOT PIE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1," You need sour cherries to make it right. And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet. That's where the real flavor is. You crush 'em up real fine. And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust."
6401,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1, Where's Jaqen?
6402,HOT PIE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1, How would I know?
6403,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1, I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
6404,GENDRY,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1, You need him?
6405,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1, He's helping me.
6406,HOT PIE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1, I saw him.
6407,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1, Where?
6408,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1, Where?
6409,HOT PIE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1, Ow!
6410,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1, Where?
6411,HOT PIE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1, They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.
6412,HOT PIE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1, On patrol. Let go of my ears.
6413,HOT PIE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1, What do you want with him anyway?
6414,QUORIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3," Mance is gonna march on the Wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth a thousand fighting against it."
6415,JON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3, They'll never trust me.
6416,QUORIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3, They might. If you do what needs to be done.
6417,JON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3, What?
6418,QUORIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3, (yelling) How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?
6419,JON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3, I didn't.
6420,QUORIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3," I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard."
6421,LORD OF BONES,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3," He's not yours to kill, crow."
6422,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, I like to keep me hands clean.
6423,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7," Yes, but do you have to do it here?"
6424,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, You should start wearing the gold cloak.
6425,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
6426,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common
6427,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7," A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."
6428,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7," Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out."
6429,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
6430,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7," Fine, fine. No gold cloak."
6431,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, What?
6432,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,  What?
6433,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, What? What? Why are you staring at me?
6434,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, (scoffs) You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
6435,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
6436,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, Stannis will be here any day.
6437,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, And one of these explains how to beat him?
6438,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7," ""An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. "" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh."
6439,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
6440,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
6441,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
6442,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
6443,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, For questioning?
6444,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
6445,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, We talked about this.
6446,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7," Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Food's worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
6447,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7," The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
6448,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7," Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted."
6449,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, (nods)
6450,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7," Ah. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer."
6451,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7," Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land."
6452,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7," And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
6453,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, We could throw books at his men.
6454,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, We don't have that many books.
6455,BRONN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7," We don't have that many men, either."
6456,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, What do we have?
6457,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7, Pig shit.
6458,SAM,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, (panting) I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
6459,DOLOROUS EDD,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
6460,GRENN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse.
6461,DOLOROUS EDD,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, You lack imagination.
6462,SAM,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, Where do you think Jon is right now?
6463,DOLOROUS EDD,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead.
6464,SAM,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5," He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter."
6465,GRENN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5," Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you."
6466,SAM,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
6467,EDDISION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, So did his father.
6468,SAM,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
6469,DOLOROUS EDD,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, Great rangers never get old is the problem. Shit ones neither. It's them in the middle that last a long time.
6470,GRENN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, What in seven hells is that?
6471,SAM,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.
6472,GRENN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, Look.
6473,DOLOROUS EDD,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5," If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it."
6474,SAM,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, That's a Night's Watch cloak.
6475,GRENN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, It's been here a long time.
6476,SAM,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, Oh. Must be dragonglass.
6477,GRENN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, Dragonglass?
6478,SAM,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, The maesters call it obsidian.
6479,GRENN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, Why would a brother hide it here?
6480,DOLOROUS EDD,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5, I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
6481,SOLDIER,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, Mind where you're going.
6482,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, I'm sorry. I'll-
6483,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, (annoyed) Where were you?
6484,JAQEN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, A man has patrol duty.
6485,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7," Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone."
6486,JAQEN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, A girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name.
6487,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
6488,JAQEN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7," A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not."
6489,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.
6490,JAQEN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, This a man cannot do.
6491,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, You promised you'd help me.
6492,JAQEN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7," Help was not promised, lovely girl. Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name."
6493,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, And you'll kill them? Anybody?
6494,JAQEN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7," By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it."
6495,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, All right. Jaqen H'ghar.
6496,JAQEN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, A girl gives a man his own name?
6497,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, That's right.
6498,JAQEN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.
6499,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.
6500,JAQEN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, Un-name me.
6501,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, No.
6502,JAQEN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, Please?
6503,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, I'll un-name you.
6504,JAQEN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, Thank you.
6505,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, If you help me and my friends escape.
6506,JAQEN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, This would require more than one life. This is not part of our bargain.
6507,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7," Fine, Jaqen H'ghar."
6508,JAQEN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7," A girl lacks honor. If I do this thing, a girl must obey."
6509,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, A girl will obey.
6510,JAQEN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7, A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
6511,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," Thank you, Podrick."
6512,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Odd little boy.
6513,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
6514,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", You and Varys both.
6515,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
6516,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", He's only a boy.
6517,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Younger boys are off fighting his war.
6518,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", He's not ready.
6519,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?"
6520,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."
6521,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us."
6522,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Do you think I'm an idiot?
6523,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
6524,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
6525,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
6526,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
6527,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
6528,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Because he doesn't have a cock.
6529,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Neither do you.
6530,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking."
6531,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", It's not that little.
6532,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", (laughs)
6533,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Why are you smiling?
6534,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Because I'm happy.
6535,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", And why are you happy?
6536,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Because I have your little whore.
6537,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", I thought you preferred blondes.
6538,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased."
6539,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Why do you care who I fuck?
6540,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."
6541,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
6542,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time."
6543,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Where did you find her?
6544,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."
6545,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
6546,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me."
6547,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," You don't buy them, you only rent them."
6548,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt."
6549,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
6550,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."
6551,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.
6552,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", I promise I will free you.
6553,ROS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Don't forget me.
6554,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Never.
6555,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1"," I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid."
6556,CERSEI,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1", Get out.
6557,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9, Shae!
6558,SHAE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9, I've been waiting all night. What is wrong?
6559,TRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9, You're beautiful.
6560,SHAE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9, Then why do you look sad?
6561,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9, We have to be more careful.
6562,SHAE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9, Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.
6563,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9, There are people who want to hurt me.
6564,SHAE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9, I know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will.
6565,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9, I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.
6566,SHAE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9, I'm yours.
6567,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9, Promise me.
6568,SHAE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9, I'm yours and you are mine.
6569,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, Still no word?
6570,ROOSE BOLTON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell. Once he captures the castle
6571,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle
6572,ROOSE BOLTON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
6573,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
6574,ROOSE BOLTON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1," A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much-"
6575,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, Any Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
6576,ROOSE BOLTON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.
6577,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1," Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace."
6578,ROOSE BOLTON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, My lady.
6579,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, How are you?
6580,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
6581,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.
6582,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.
6583,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, You have every right. You're a king.
6584,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, That's not the kind of king I want to be.
6585,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, What kind do you want to be?
6586,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
6587,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1," I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry."
6588,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, I'd like to hear you play the harp.
6589,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1," No. No, you would not."
6590,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
6591,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1," When I was twelve, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on."
6592,ROBB,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
6593,TALISA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1, I don't want you to marry her. But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.
6594,HOT PIE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.
6595,GENDRY,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", Shut up.
6596,HOT PIE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1"," Probably in the piecrust by now. In the oven. The nice, warm oven."
6597,AYRA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", Shut up. What did you bring?
6598,HOT PIE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages.
6599,GENDRY,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", What did he want us to do about those guards?
6600,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1"," He didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates."""
6601,GENDRY,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", What about the guards?
6602,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", He didn't say anything about the guards.
6603,GENDRY,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1"," What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think?"
6604,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", We have to trust him.
6605,GENDRY,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.
6606,HOT PIE,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", I want to go back to the kitchens.
6607,ARYA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.
6608,GENDRY,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1"," Arry, don't."
6609,MAN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, Away! Reset!
6610,DAVOS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1," If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day."
6611,STANNIS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, Will it hold?
6612,DAVOS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1," Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace."
6613,MAN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1," Again, pull!"
6614,STANNIS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1," I admire you, Ser Davos."
6615,DAVOS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1," I thank you, Your Grace."
6616,STANNIS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1," Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag."
6617,DAVOS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1," My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me."
6618,STANNIS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, Do you? Why?
6619,DAVOS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, My father was a crabber.
6620,STANNIS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, And?
6621,DAVOS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1," Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink."
6622,STANNIS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
6623,DAVOS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.
6624,STANNIS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
6625,DAVOS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, Some are happy to do it to my face.
6626,STANNIS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1," We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men."
6627,DAVOS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1," No one has forgotten, Your Grace."
6628,STANNIS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
6629,DAVOS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, He was only a boy.
6630,STANNIS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
6631,DAVOS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, (exhales)
6632,STANNIS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1," First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."
6633,DAVOS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1," And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe."
6634,STANNIS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
6635,DAVOS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, I was relieved they did not.
6636,STANNIS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1," Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
6637,DAVOS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1," Your Grace, I pray I serve you well."
6638,STANNIS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1, I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
6639,JOFFREY,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11, You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.
6640,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell."
6641,JOFFREY,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11, The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.
6642,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?"
6643,JOFFREY,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him."
6644,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you."
6645,JOFFREY,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11, They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
6646,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11, Imagine Stannis' terror.
6647,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11, I am trying.
6648,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11, You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
6649,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."
6650,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
6651,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," I wish we could, too."
6652,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11, What do you want? Tell me.
6653,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," If we're going to play, you'll have to start."
6654,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock."
6655,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11, A most highborn plumber.
6656,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11, The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
6657,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game."
6658,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11, I do. Last thing I expected.
6659,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11, And you play it well.
6660,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
6661,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11, They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
6662,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?"
6663,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats."
6664,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11, We should sail there immediately.
6665,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives."
6666,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11, A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
6667,VARYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide."
6668,TYRION,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11," One game at a time, my friend."
6669,JORAH,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5," Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow."
6670,DAENERYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5, Astapor?
6671,JORAH,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5, We cannot stay here.
6672,DAENERYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5, They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
6673,JORAH,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5," They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die."
6674,DAENERYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5, You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
6675,JORAH,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5," You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve."
6676,DAENERYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5," Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there."
6677,JORAH,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5," That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong."
6678,DAENERYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5, And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
6679,JORAH,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5," Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face."
6680,DAENERYS,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5, They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.
6681,JORAH,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5, (nods)
6682,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_11, We should bury them.
6683,DAGMER,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_11, I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message.
6684,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_11," If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer."
6685,DAGMER,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_11, What's this?
6686,THEON,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_11, Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.
6687,DAGMER,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_11, His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now.
6688,DAGMER,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_11," His wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him."
6689,OSHA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS_1, Got as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
6690,LUWIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS_1, You're right so far.
6691,OSHA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS_1, Who was that out there hung up at the gates?
6692,LUWIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS_1, Must have been the farmer's boys.
6693,OSHA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS_1, He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
6694,LUWIN,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS_1, They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.
6695,OSHA,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS_1, They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.
6696,MATTHOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53, That's it. The tide's against us.
6697,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53," Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates."
6698,MATTHOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53, You're coming home.
6699,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53, King's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.
6700,MATTHOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53," This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain."
6701,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53," Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment."
6702,MATTHOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53," Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand."
6703,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53, Gods be good.
6704,MATTHOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53," God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us."
6705,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53, But not over them?
6706,MATTHOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53," Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike."
6707,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53," Well, first, we have to put it there."
6708,MATTHOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53, Our ships outnumber theirs ten-to-one.
6709,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53," Our army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire."
6710,MATTHOS,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_53, I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.
6711,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_3"," Are you afraid, my lion?"
6712,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_3"," If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."
6713,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_3", I won't let them hurt you.
6714,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_3", I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
6715,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_3", It is now.
6716,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_3", You can't fuck your way out of everything.
6717,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_3", I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.
6718,PYCELLE,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1," As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war."
6719,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1, Your words are always wise and measured.
6720,PYCELLE,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1," If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King"
6721,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1, You brought me something?
6722,PYCELLE,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1," Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however-"
6723,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1, I know what ten drops will bring.
6724,PYCELLE,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1," Your Grace, if I may ask-"
6725,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1, You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
6726,PYCELLE,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1, Yes. A siege is very-
6727,ERSEI,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1," Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many."
6728,PYCELLE,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1, Your Grace.
6729,MEN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13," (singing) And so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his halls / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls / And not a soul to hear-"
6730,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, To the boys!
6731,MEN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,
6732,SOLDIER,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, Lannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song?
6733,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, Drunk Lannisters.
6734,PROSTITUTE,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, You've got a pretty voice.
6735,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, Thank you very much.
6736,PROSTITUTE,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, And I like your nose. How many times you break it?
6737,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13," Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker."
6738,PROSTITUTE,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,  Oh.
6739,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
6740,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13," Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-"
6741,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13," Eh, you don't want to know about the third time."
6742,PROSTITUTE,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, Poor nose.
6743,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
6744,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13," Welcome, friends. This round's on me."
6745,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, (whispering) I don't think he likes me.
6746,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, You think you're a hard man?
6747,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, I know it.
6748,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
6749,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13," Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me."
6750,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, Only smaller.
6751,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, And quicker. Eh?
6752,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
6753,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, Aye I expect he will someday.
6754,MAN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, Here we are.
6755,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13, One more drink before the war? Shall we?
6756,VARYS,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1," I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege."
6757,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1, A wedding.
6758,VARYS,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1," Exactly. Podrick, is that it?"
6759,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1," ""Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town."
6760,VARYS,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1, I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
6761,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1, I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
6762,VARYS,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1, Do you trust him?
6763,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1," Oddly enough, I do."
6764,VARYS,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1, Good.
6765,VARYS,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1, The map you asked for.
6766,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1, There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.
6767,VARYS,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1, Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
6768,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1," I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
6769,VARYS,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1," That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord."
6770,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1," Well, I'm not."
6771,VARYS,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1," For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai."
6772,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1, What of it?
6773,VARYS,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1," You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
6774,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1," Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
6775,VARYS,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1, I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
6776,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1," Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself."
6777,VARYS,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1," And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut."
6778,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1," No, I don't believe you have."
6779,VARYS,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1," One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him."
6780,MATTHOS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_1, They're welcoming the new king.
6781,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_1, I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.
6782,MATTHOS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_1, Drums!
6783,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," Remember, wait till the ships-"
6784,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, The ships are in the bay.
6785,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, They must be far enough in-
6786,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?"
6787,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
6788,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
6789,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, Don't get killed.
6790,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," Nor you, my friend."
6791,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," Oh, are we friends now?"
6792,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
6793,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," Enhances it, really."
6794,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword."
6795,BRONN,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, Been spending time with fancy folks.
6796,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, Lady Sansa and Sheila.
6797,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, Shae.
6798,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast."
6799,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off."
6800,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, Sansa.
6801,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," Always been a great romantic, my nephew."
6802,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," Sansa, come here."
6803,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," I will pray for your safe return, my lord."
6804,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, Will you?
6805,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, Just as I pray for the king's.
6806,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," Stay safe, my lady."
6807,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," And you, my lion."
6808,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, Your king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss.
6809,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it."
6810,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.
6811,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, Will you slay him yourself?
6812,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
6813,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
6814,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
6815,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender."
6816,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15," Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too."
6817,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, Some of those boys will never come back.
6818,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15, Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.
6819,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"  Shh. Come, my lady."
6820,LANCEL,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1, Where's our fleet?
6821,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1, On the way.
6822,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1, Why isn't it here now? They're coming.
6823,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1," Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question."
6824,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1, The king has asked you a question.
6825,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1," Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy."
6826,LANCEL,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1, The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king-
6827,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1," If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought."
6828,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1," That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet."
6829,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_3, Where are their ships?
6830,MATTHOS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_3, It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
6831,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_3, Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.
6832,MATTHOS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_3," If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied."
6833,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_3, Maybe.
6834,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
6835,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
6836,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, I doubt it.
6837,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, Maybe she's jealous of you.
6838,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, Why would she be jealous?
6839,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, Sansa.
6840,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1," I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?"
6841,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, Yes.
6842,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1," Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine."
6843,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1," I'm not thirsty, Your Grace."
6844,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, So? I didn't offer you water.
6845,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, What's he doing here?
6846,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1," Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
6847,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, But we have guards to defend us.
6848,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1," Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors."
6849,GOLD CLOAK,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
6850,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
6851,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
6852,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, You said he was here to protect us.
6853,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1, He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.
6854,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1, There they are.
6855,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1, Archers to their marks.
6856,SOLDIER,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1," Archers, to your marks!"
6857,SOLDIER,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1, Archers! Nock your arrows!
6858,SOLDIER #2,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1, Nock arrows!
6859,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1, Hold fast.
6860,SOLDIER,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1, Hold fast!
6861,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1, What are you doing? We need to attack them.
6862,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1, Hold fast.
6863,SOLDIER,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1, Boulders ready!
6864,SOLDIER #2,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1, Hold fast!
6865,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1, There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?
6866,MATTHOS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_5, There's only one ship.
6867,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_5," Archers, stand to! Man the below! Nock."
6868,MAN,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_5, Nock and set!
6869,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_5, Draw! Hold.
6870,MAN,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_5, Hold.
6871,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_5, (confused) There's no one on board.
6872,MAN,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_1, More rocks coming up!
6873,MAN,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_7, Hold.
6874,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_7, Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!
6875,DAVOS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_9, Matthos! Get down!
6876,STANNIS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_13, Prepare to land.
6877,SOLDIER,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_13, Your Grace.
6878,STANNIS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_13, The dwarf has played his little trick.
6879,SOLDIER,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_13, The wildfire.
6880,STANNIS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_13, He can only play it once.
6881,SOLDIER,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_13," We're too far from the gates. The fire, their archers- Hundreds will die."
6882,STANNIS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_13, Thousands.
6883,STANNIS,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_13, Come with me and take this city!
6884,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3," Sansa, come here, little dove."
6885,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3, My queen.
6886,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3, What are you doing?
6887,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3, Praying.
6888,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3," You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for?"
6889,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3, For the gods to have mercy on us all.
6890,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3, Oh. On all of us?
6891,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3," Yes, Your Grace."
6892,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3, Even me?
6893,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3," Of course, Your Grace."
6894,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3, Even Joffrey?
6895,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3, Joffrey is my-
6896,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3," Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four."
6897,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3, Your father doesn't believe in the gods?
6898,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3," He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much."
6899,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3, One for her.
6900,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3, Here. Sit. Drink.
6901,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3," Not like that. Drink, girl."
6902,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3, I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.
6903,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3, They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.
6904,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3," It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits."
6905,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3, And if the city should fall?
6906,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3," You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse."
6907,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3," Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink."
6908,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3," Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten."
6909,MAN,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR_1," More pressure! Pull! Pull! That's it, men! Pull! Pull!"
6910,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_9," He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon."
6911,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_9, They're coming. They're coming ashore.
6912,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_9, Rain fire on them.
6913,MAN,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_9, Archers!
6914,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_9, There are too many.
6915,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_9," Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now."
6916,PODRICK,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_9," Yes, my lord."
6917,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,BELOW THE HARBOR WALL_1," Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat. You, too."
6918,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,BELOW THE HARBOR WALL_1," Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts."
6919,MEN,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR_3," Pull, pull! Go!"
6920,SOLDIER,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_11, Nock! Draw!
6921,MEN,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_11, Draw!  Draw!
6922,MEN,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR_5, Kill the Lannisters!
6923,MEN,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_13, Loose! Loose!
6924,MAN,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR_7, Form the line!
6925,MEN,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_15, Draw! Draw! Loose! Loose!
6926,STANNIS,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_15," To the Mud Gate, go now!"
6927,MEN,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_15," First and second squads, to the gate! To the Mud Gate!"
6928,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,INSIDE THE HARBOR WALL_1," Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse."
6929,CERSEL,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5," When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired."
6930,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, You were Robert's queen.
6931,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.
6932,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, Pretty.
6933,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5," That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend."
6934,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?
6935,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5," A few weeks, Your Grace."
6936,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, When did you leave Lorath?
6937,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
6938,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, (smiles)
6939,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?
6940,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5," Ten years ago, Your Grace."
6941,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5," From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?"
6942,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5," Shae, Your Grace."
6943,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5," Tell us a story, Shae."
6944,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5," When I was thireen, I-"
6945,LANCEL,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, Your Grace!
6946,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, What news?
6947,LANCEL,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5," The Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls."
6948,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, Where is Joffrey?
6949,LANCEL,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
6950,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, Bring him back inside at once.
6951,LANCEL,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, Your Grace-
6952,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, What?
6953,LANCEL,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, The king's presence is good for morale.
6954,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, Bring him back to his chambers now.
6955,LANCEL,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, Not here?
6956,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?
6957,LANCEL,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5," No, but I-"
6958,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5, Now!
6959,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5," When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive."
6960,MAN,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR SHORE_1, Help me!
6961,MAN,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR SHORE_1, Fall back! Fall back!
6962,STANNIS,2,19,blackwater,STANNIS ON THE HARBOR SHORE_1, Get the ladders up!
6963,MAN,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1," Faster, you bastards! Faster! Come on, kill the scum!"
6964,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1, Someone bring me a drink.
6965,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1, Fuck the water. Bring me wine.
6966,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1," Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?"
6967,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1," Eat shit, dwarf."
6968,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1, You're on the wrong side of the wall.
6969,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1, I lost half my men. The Blackwater's on fire.
6970,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1," Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight!"
6971,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1," You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city."
6972,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1, Fuck the Kingsguard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king.
6973,MAN,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR_9, Loose!
6974,MAN #2,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR_9, Put your backs into it!
6975,MAN #3,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR_9," All right, get up!"
6976,MAN,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR_9, Loose!
6977,MAN #2,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR_9, Clear!
6978,MAN #3,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR_9, Forward!
6979,MAN,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR_9, Loose!
6980,MAN,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR_9, Forward ladders!
6981,MEN,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR_9, Heave! Heave!
6982,LANCEL,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1," Your Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep."
6983,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1," If you won't defend your own city, why should they?"
6984,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1, What would you have me do?
6985,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1, Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
6986,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1, What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me?
6987,LANCEL,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1," She did not say, Your Grace."
6988,MAN,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1, All men to the battlements!
6989,JOFFREY,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1," Ser Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my uncle and represent the king on the field of battle."
6990,MANDON,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1, (nods)
6991,MAN,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1," Archers, hold your line or I'll kill you myself."
6992,MAN,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1, Stand fast!
6993,MAN #2,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1," No! Get up, you fool."
6994,MAN #3,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1, We need more arrows!
6995,MAN,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1, Where is the king?  Why isn't he with us?
6996,MAN #2,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1, Who are we fighting for?
6997,MAN #3,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1, Who leads us?
6998,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1, I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!
6999,MAN,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1, Yes.
7000,MAN #2,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1,  What are you talking about?
7001,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1," Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?"
7002,MAN,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1, The only way out is through the gates. And they're at the gates.
7003,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1, There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
7004,MEN,2,19,blackwater,BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL_1, Heave! Heave!
7005,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_3," Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape."
7006,MEN,2,19,blackwater,BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL_3, Heave! Heave! Heave!
7007,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_5, Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.
7008,LANCEL,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7," The battle is lost, Your Grace. Stannis' troops are at the gates. When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart."
7009,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7, Where is my son?
7010,LANCEL,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7, I want to escort him back to the battle.
7011,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7, Why do I care what you want? Bring me-
7012,LANCEL,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7, Now listen to me-
7013,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7,"  Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy..."
7014,ALL,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7," Save our sons from war, we pray."
7015,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7, You must go. Run to your chamber and bar your door. Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.
7016,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7, Come with me.
7017,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7, I need to say goodbye to someone.
7018,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7, The queen said they'd rape everyone.
7019,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7, No one is raping me.
7020,SHAE,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7, Go. Run.
7021,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1, The lady is starting to panic.
7022,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1, What are you doing here?
7023,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1, Not here for long. I'm going.
7024,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1, Where?
7025,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1," Someplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be."
7026,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1, What about the king?
7027,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1, He can die just fine on his own.
7028,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1, I can take you with me. Take you to Winterfell.
7029,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1, I'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home?
7030,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1, I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.
7031,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1, Look at me. Stannis is a killer. The Lannisters are killers. Your father was a killer. Your brother is a killer. Your sons will be killers someday. The world is built by killers. So you'd better get used to looking at them.
7032,SANSA,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1, You won't hurt me.
7033,THE HOUND,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1," No, little bird, I won't hurt you."
7034,MEN,2,19,blackwater,BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL_5, Heave!
7035,MAN,2,19,blackwater,BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL_5," Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!"
7036,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL_5, Attack!
7037,MEN,2,19,blackwater,BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL_5,  Roll it over!
7038,ALL,2,19,blackwater,BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL_5, Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!
7039,TYRION,2,19,blackwater,BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL_5," Oh, fuck me."
7040,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1," Shh! Be calm, my sweet."
7041,TOMMEN,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1, They're still fighting.
7042,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1, No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.
7043,TOMMEN,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1, The Kingswood?
7044,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1," Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things."
7045,TOMMEN,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1, Like what?
7046,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1, Like stags.
7047,TOMMEN,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1, Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass.
7048,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1, And wolves.
7049,PODRICK,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR SHORE_3, My lord.
7050,CERSEL,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR SHORE_3," He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, ""You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid."""
7051,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_3," ""For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head."""
7052,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_5," And the cub said, ""Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"""
7053,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_5," ""Yes,"" said his mother. ""You will be strong and fierce just like your father."""
7054,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_7," ""I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you."""
7055,MAN,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR SHORE_9, Back to the boats!
7056,STANNIS,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR SHORE_9," Stand and fight! Stand and fight, damn you!"
7057,STANNIS,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR SHORE_9, No!
7058,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_9, Father.
7059,TYWIN,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_9, The battle is over. We have won.
7060,CERSEI,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_9, (cries)
7061,MALE SINGER,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_9," ""And who are you,"" the proud lord said / ""That I must bow so low?"" / ""Only a cat of a different coat / That's all the truth I know / In a coat of gold or a coat of red / A lion still has claws / And mine are long and sharp, my lord / As long and sharp as yours"" / And so he spoke, and so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his hall / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall / And not a soul to hear1Embed"
7062,TYRION,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_54, Pod.
7063,TYRION,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_54, Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive.
7064,PODRICK,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_54," Yes, my lord."
7065,PYCELLE,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_54, Would you like something for the pain?
7066,TYRION,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_54, What happened?
7067,PYCELLE,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_54, The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.
7068,TYRION,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_54, Where am I?
7069,PYCELLE,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_54," These are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King."
7070,PYCELLE,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_54," Oh, For your trouble."
7071,JOFFREY,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfather, Tywin Lannister, the savior of the city and the Hand of the King."
7072,TYWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," Thank you, Your Grace."
7073,JOFFREY,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward."
7074,JOFFREY,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time."
7075,LITTLEFINGER,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," You honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons."
7076,JOFFREY,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1, Ser Loras Tyrell.
7077,JOFFFREY,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," Your house has come to our aid. The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I. If your family would ask anything of me, ask it, and it shall be yours."
7078,LORAS,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before... She remains innocent. I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our houses."
7079,JOFFREY,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?"
7080,MARGAERY,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me."
7081,JOFFREY,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady. It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another. A king must keep his word."
7082,CERSEI,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside."
7083,CROWD,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1, Margaery! We want Margaery!
7084,JOFFREY,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow."
7085,PYCELLE,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness. I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods."
7086,JOFFREY,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," The gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister. You will be my queen and I will love you from this day until my last day."
7087,LITTLEFINGER,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1, My lady. My sincerest condolences.
7088,SANSA,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1, They're right. I'm not good enough for him.
7089,LITTLEFINGER,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well."
7090,SANSA,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," But, if he's not marrying me-"
7091,LITTLEFINGER,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1," He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home."
7092,SANSA,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1, King's Landing is my home now.
7093,LITTLEFINGER,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1, Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.
7094,ROS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, Come in. Make yourself comfortable.
7095,ROS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1," That doesn't look very comfortable. Here, watch me."
7096,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1," No need for that, my dear."
7097,ROS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, You sure? Most men like what they see.
7098,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, I'm not like most men.
7099,ROS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, That's what most men say.
7100,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, (laughs)
7101,ROS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1," If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do."
7102,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.
7103,ROS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, Have we met?
7104,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, You wouldn't remember me if we had?
7105,ROS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, I meet a lot of men.
7106,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them.
7107,ROS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1," You're very kind, my lord. Allow me to return the favor."
7108,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.
7109,ROS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, I know who you are.
7110,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1," And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other."
7111,ROS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, How do you know about that?
7112,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, I thought you said you knew who I was.
7113,ROS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1," What can I do for you, Lord Varys?"
7114,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.
7115,ROS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1, I'm afraid of him.
7116,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1," Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks."
7117,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," You're a virgin, I take it?"
7118,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Walk.
7119,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne."
7120,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, One or two tried.
7121,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough."
7122,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Not interested.
7123,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
7124,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," Ah. ""They lay with lions."" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks."
7125,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.
7126,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.
7127,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, What are you doing?
7128,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Burying them.
7129,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.
7130,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, I think these women would understand if I don't care what you think.
7131,MAN,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, I didn't leave it here.
7132,MAN #2,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, I had me dagger.
7133,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Untie me. Now!
7134,MAN,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have me dagger no more."
7135,MAN,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," So unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it's gone. (notices BRIENNE and JAIME) Whoa. What's your business here?"
7136,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Traveling a prisoner.
7137,MAN,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, You're a woman. A woman!
7138,MAN #2,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," Well, fuck me!"
7139,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, If you've quite finished up-
7140,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," All right, we'll be going."
7141,MAN,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Whoa. Whoa! Who do you fight for?
7142,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, The Starks.
7143,MAN #2,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, What did he do?
7144,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
7145,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," No, stealing is a crime."
7146,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.
7147,MAN,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Where are you taking him?
7148,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, To Riverrun.
7149,MAN #2,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Why Riverrun?
7150,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in."
7151,MAN #2,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Why not kill him?
7152,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, For stealing a pig?
7153,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.
7154,MAN,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Sending him with you? How important could he be?
7155,MAN,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," All right, have it your way, my lady."
7156,MAN #2,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Do I know you?
7157,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Have you been to Ashemark?
7158,MAN #2,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, No.
7159,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Then you don't know me.
7160,MAN #2,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?
7161,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Is it near Ashemark?
7162,MAN #2,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, No.
7163,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, I've never been there.
7164,MAN,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, What do you think of these beauties?
7165,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, I hope you gave them quick deaths.
7166,MAN,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," Two of them we did, yeah."
7167,MAN #2,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Wait. I do know you. That's Jaime Lannister.
7168,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
7169,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it."
7170,MAN,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?
7171,MAN #2,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king.
7172,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head."
7173,MAN,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," I have a question for you both. And I want you to answer it at the same time. I count to three, you both answer. What's his name? One. Two. Three."
7174,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Two quick deaths.
7175,JAIME,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1, Those were Stark men.
7176,BRIENNE,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1," I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay."
7177,CATELYN,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1, Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
7178,ROBB,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1, I know that.
7179,CATELYN,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1, And you mean to do it anyway?
7180,ROBB,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1, I love her.
7181,CATELYN,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1, I know that seems important to you.
7182,ROBB,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1, It is important to me.
7183,CATELYN,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1," Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer."
7184,ROBB,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1," And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?"
7185,CATELYN,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1, Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?
7186,ROBB,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1, Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
7187,CATELYN,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1," And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing"
7188,ROBB,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1, My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.
7189,STANNIS,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", You said you saw my victory in the flames.
7190,MELISANDRE,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", l I did. I still see it.
7191,STANNIS,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1","  The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?"
7192,MELISANDRE,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
7193,STANNIS,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", You claimed to speak for a god.
7194,MELISANDRE,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?
7195,STANNIS,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", You talk about war as if you understand it.
7196,MELISANDRE,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", I've been fighting far longer than you.
7197,STANNIS,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", Have you? Show me how you fight.
7198,STANNIS,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", Show me.
7199,STANNIS,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?
7200,MELISANDRE,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", Inside you.
7201,STANNIS,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", I murdered my brother.
7202,MELISANDRE,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", We murdered him. Share the weight with me.
7203,STANNIS,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", He wasn't your brother.
7204,MELISANDRE,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king.
7205,STANNIS,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1"," You promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know."
7206,MELISANDRE,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", Let me show you.
7207,MELISANDRE,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Look into the fire, my king. Look."
7208,STANNIS,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", I see fire.
7209,MELISANDRE,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Keep looking. Do you see? Do you see, my king?"
7210,STANNIS,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1", Yes.
7211,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13," I will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall."
7212,LUWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, They want you to know you're surrounded.
7213,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.
7214,LUWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before
7215,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13," Thank you, wise bald man. Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me."
7216,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, No word from my father?
7217,LUWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, No.
7218,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, Send more ravens.
7219,LUWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, You killed all the ravens.
7220,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, The first time I saw Winterfell-
7221,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13," First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, ""Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. ""We never stood a chance against the man who lives here."""
7222,LUWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.
7223,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13," Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father"
7224,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13," I will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man."
7225,LUWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13," Theon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you."
7226,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13," And what's your counsel, trusted friend?"
7227,LUWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, Run. Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have twenty men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run.
7228,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13," There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family."
7229,LUWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch.
7230,LUWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13," Once a man has taken the black, he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven."
7231,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it ten feet past the Winterfell gates.
7232,LUWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck...
7233,LUWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13," The Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there."
7234,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.
7235,LUWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.
7236,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13," I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing."
7237,LUWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13," I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet."
7238,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13, You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.
7239,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1"," You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to fuck us. Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one."
7240,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", They say every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.
7241,MEN,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", Aye!
7242,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", You think they're right?
7243,BLACK LORREN,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", Aye.
7244,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1"," We die today, brothers. We die bleeding from a hundred wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren. Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle."
7245,MEN,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", Aye!
7246,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", Mothers will name their sons for us.
7247,MEN,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", Aye!
7248,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.
7249,MEN,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", Aye!
7250,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!
7251,MEN,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", Aye!
7252,THEON,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", What is dead may never die!
7253,MEN,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", What is dead may never die!
7254,BLACK LORREN,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", Thought he'd never shut up.
7255,DAGMER,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt.
7256,LUWIN,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", What is this? What are you doing?
7257,DAGMER,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", Let's go home.
7258,MAN,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING_1", Come on.
7259,TYRION,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5", Why should I believe you?
7260,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5", Why would I lie about it?
7261,TYRION,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5", To create strife between my sister and me.
7262,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5"," Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man."
7263,TYRION,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5", Pod.
7264,PODRICK,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5"," Yes, my lord?"
7265,TYRION,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5", Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
7266,PODRICK,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5"," No, my lord."
7267,TYRION,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5"," You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times."
7268,PODRICK,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5", (nods)
7269,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5", I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak.
7270,TYRION,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5", Then my hill tribesmen.
7271,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5"," Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord."
7272,TYRION,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5", Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.
7273,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5"," We are. Podrick, would you mind?"
7274,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5"," There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget."
7275,VARYS,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5"," Come along now, Podrick."
7276,SHAE,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5", My love.
7277,TYRION,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5", It was good of you to come.
7278,SHAE,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5", Good of me? Of course I come.
7279,SHAE,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5", I want to see you.
7280,TYRION,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5"," Believe me, you don't."
7281,SHAE,2,20,valar morghulis,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5", Have you looked?

7452,TORMUND,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, I smell a crow.
7453,RATTLESHIRT,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, We killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one.
7454,TORMUND,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, What do we want with a baby crow?
7455,YGRITTE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.
7456,TORMUND,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.
7457,JON,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
7458,TORMUND,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?"
7459,JON,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Jon Snow.
7460,JON,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Your Grace.
7461,TORMUND,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart. ( Laughs. )"
7462,MANCE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," Stand, boy. We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall."
7463,MANCE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," So, you're Ned Stark's bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us."
7464,MANCE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," The girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?"
7465,TORMUND,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls."
7466,MANCE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
7467,TORMUND,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,  Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.
7468,MANCE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead.
7469,MANCE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, He was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him?
7470,JON,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
7471,MANCE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Why?
7472,JON,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, He wants me to lead one day.
7473,MANCE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-Beyond-the-Wall."
7474,JON,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," If I'm a traitor, then you are, too."
7475,MANCE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?"
7476,JON,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, (Hesitates) I want to be free.
7477,MANCE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?"
7478,JON,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
7479,MANCE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, You saw what?
7480,JON,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
7481,MANCE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?
7482,JON,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?"
7483,MANCE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, We'll need to find you a new cloak.
7484,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, What if you took off that bit there?
7485,WHORE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Don't you want to leave something to the imagination?
7486,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," Trouble is, I've never had much imagination."
7487,WHORE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, I want you to take it off.
7488,WHORE,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Mouth.
7489,PODRICK,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.
7490,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, I didn't hear that.
7491,PODRICK,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," Apologies, ser."
7492,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Back away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. Then back away some more.
7493,PODRICK,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Lord Tyrion sent me.
7494,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," I will murder you, boy."
7495,PODRICK,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, He said it was a matter of life and death.
7496,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Pod?
7497,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, It's your sister. The queen.
7498,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, What are they doing here?
7499,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?"
7500,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," No, I don't think so."
7501,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?"
7502,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, They stay outside.
7503,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," I'm not afraid of you, little brother."
7504,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Why are you here?
7505,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that."
7506,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
7507,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father."
7508,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me."
7509,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.
7510,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
7511,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, You're meeting Father today?
7512,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, How do you know that?
7513,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?
7514,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came."
7515,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, You're going to make me cry.
7516,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Why do you care what I want from him?
7517,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Because you've slandered me to Father before.
7518,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Slandered? When?
7519,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
7520,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe."
7521,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," I was nine, too."
7522,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," She lost an eye, if I remember correctly."
7523,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again."
7524,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, It's not slander if it's true.
7525,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?
7526,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
7527,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey."
7528,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Any lies in particular?
7529,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are."
7530,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Still makes me more clever than you.
7531,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares."
7532,MERYN TRANT,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Ser Meryn Trant.
7533,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
7534,MERYN TRANT,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, You're no knight.
7535,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Pod.
7536,PODRICK,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.
7537,MERYN TRANT,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more."
7538,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion."
7539,MERYN TRANT,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand."
7540,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me."
7541,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.
7542,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, I've been doing that for a while now.
7543,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Do you grow bored protecting me?
7544,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, I grow poor protecting you.
7545,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch."
7546,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Briefly.
7547,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, I'm sure you filled your pockets.
7548,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1," And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more."
7549,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, I thought we were friends.
7550,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
7551,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, How much?
7552,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Double.
7553,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Double?
7554,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.
7555,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
7556,BRONN,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Which means you can afford it.
7557,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1, Here. Here! Help me!
7558,MAN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Who are you?
7559,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight.
7560,MAN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," Aye, ser, and serving which king?"
7561,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", The one true king of Westeros...  Stannis Baratheon.
7562,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I thought you were dead. Everyone thought you were dead. And your son?
7563,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", (Nods)
7564,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", He may have swam ashore as you did.
7565,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," No, the wildfire took him. I saw it."
7566,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," I'm so sorry, my friend. I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world. But, Davos, you were a good father."
7567,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives?"
7568,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
7569,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Will you take me there?
7570,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
7571,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", This war is not over.
7572,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," Not for you, maybe. But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over."
7573,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", We're both sworn to King Stannis.
7574,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I am sworn to no man. I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory. I delivered the ships.
7575,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Stannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ...
7576,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," He's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive."
7577,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", What?
7578,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned.
7579,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I'm a pirate.
7580,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", You're a smuggler.
7581,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Servants of darkness. I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
7582,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," Take me back there, please."
7583,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", You cannot turn Stannis against her.
7584,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out."
7585,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," You could try. If you fail, they will burn you. If you succeed, they'll burn you. And you've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend."
7586,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.
7587,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors."
7588,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," I have to stop her. Please, do this for me."
7589,SALLADHOR,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck."
7590,ROOSE BOLTON,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", We should set the siege lines a thousand yards from Harrenhal.
7591,ROBB,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
7592,ROOSE BOLTON,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.
7593,ROBB,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.
7594,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Two hundred Northmen slaughtered like sheep.
7595,ROOSE BOLTON,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons."
7596,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
7597,ROOSE BOLTON,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him.
7598,ROBB,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", A Mallister?
7599,CATELYN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.
7600,ROBB,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", (to his men) Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
7601,TALISA,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", She's your mother.
7602,ROBB,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
7603,QYBURN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", (barely audible) Water. Water.
7604,TALISA,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", This needs to be cleaned and closed.
7605,ROBB,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," What's your name, friend?"
7606,QYBURN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Qyburn.
7607,TALISA,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", You're lucky to be alive.
7608,QYBURN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Lucky?
7609,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", (sighs) The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?
7610,TYWIN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Am I enjoying it?
7611,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I was very happy as Hand of the King.
7612,TYWIN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", (chuckles) Yes. I heard how happy you were.
7613,TYWIN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", You brought a whore into my bed.
7614,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", It wasn't your bed at the time.
7615,TYWIN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves."
7616,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
7617,TYWIN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," What do you want, Tyrion?"
7618,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
7619,TYWIN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
7620,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start."
7621,TYWIN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want."
7622,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir."
7623,TYWIN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", You want Casterly Rock?
7624,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", It is mine by right.
7625,TYWIN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," (sighs) We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock."
7626,TYRION,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Why?
7627,TYWIN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."
7628,TYWIN,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang."
7629,SANSA,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Dorne. It's going to Dorne.
7630,SHAE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Why Dorne?
7631,SANSA,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
7632,SHAE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.
7633,SANSA,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Don't ruin the game.
7634,SHAE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," I told you, I don't want to play."
7635,SANSA,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", (pointing to another ship) What about that one there?
7636,SHAE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", That one? It's going to Volantis.
7637,SANSA,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Why?
7638,SHAE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one."
7639,SANSA,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
7640,SHAE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
7641,SANSA,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
7642,LITTLEFINGER,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.
7643,SANSA,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Lord Baelish.
7644,LITTLEFINGER,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
7645,LITTLEFINGER,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.
7646,SANSA,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
7647,LITTLEFINGER,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
7648,SANSA,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I won't tell anyone.
7649,LITTLEFINGER,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", How do I know?
7650,SANSA,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when."
7651,LITTLEFINGER,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice."
7652,ROS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", You're her handmaiden?
7653,SHAE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Yes. And you're his...?
7654,ROS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I help manage his affairs.
7655,SHAE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", He's an important person.
7656,ROS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," So is she. I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle. The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset. We've both done rather well, you and I."
7657,SHAE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Yes.
7658,ROS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Given where we started.
7659,SHAE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", And where is that?
7660,ROS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Watch out for her.
7661,SHAE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I always do.
7662,ROS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Watch out for her with him.
7663,JORAH,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", They're growing fast.
7664,DAENERYS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army
7665,JORAH,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
7666,DAENERYS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people.
7667,JORAH,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
7668,DAENERYS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", It's too beautiful a day to argue.
7669,JORAH,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas.
7670,DAENERYS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ..."
7671,JORAH,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi. You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong. And not before."
7672,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Your Grace.
7673,STANNIS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I heard you were dead.
7674,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Not yet.
7675,STANNIS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace."
7676,STANNIS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", We are alone.
7677,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," Your Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight."
7678,STANNIS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I am fighting.
7679,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", By burning prisoners alive?
7680,MELISANDRE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?"
7681,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone."
7682,MELISANDRE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I'm not your enemy.
7683,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", You are my enemy.
7684,MELISANDRE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them."
7685,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", (gasps)
7686,MELISANDRE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," Don't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true."
7687,MELISANDRE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",  Death by fire is the purest death.
7688,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", (growls) This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons.
7689,STANNIS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
7690,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Your Grace!
7691,GUARD,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Come on.
7692,MELISANDRE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos."
7693,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", She will destroy us all!
7694,MELISANDRE,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", I will pray for you.
7695,DAVOS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Your Grace!
7696,GUARD,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Guard
7697,GUARD #2,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Guard #2
7698,JOFFREY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", Why have we stopped?
7699,GUARD,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1"," It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace."
7700,JOFFREY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1", What is she doing? Who gave her permission?
7701,MAID,3,21,valar dohaeris,NEARBY STREETS_1," My lady. We should have guards, my lady."
7702,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,NEARBY STREETS_1, Why?
7703,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,NEARBY STREETS_1, Pardon me.
7704,MAID,3,21,valar dohaeris,NEARBY STREETS_1," Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress."
7705,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,NEARBY STREETS_1, I have others.
7706,GUARD,3,21,valar dohaeris,JOFFREY'Ss PALAQUIN._1," Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?"
7707,JOFFREY,3,21,valar dohaeris,JOFFREY'Ss PALAQUIN._1, No.
7708,CHILD,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD_1, He was a soldier. He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay. He never came back.
7709,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD_1, And your mother?
7710,CHILD,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD_1, She died when she had me.
7711,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD_1," Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them."
7712,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD_1," Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father."
7713,CHILD,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD_1, He wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier.
7714,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD_1, And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him.
7715,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD_1," Was your father a soldier, too?"
7716,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD_1," You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you."
7717,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1"," Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them. Directly to me."
7718,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1", Your Grace.
7719,LORAS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1", Your Grace.
7720,JOFFREY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1"," Please, sit. Sit. I do apologize, my lady. Small council meetings. At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time?"
7721,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1", (laughs)
7722,JOFFREY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1"," That's a lovely gown, my lady."
7723,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1"," Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold."
7724,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1"," The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace."
7725,JOFFREY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1"," Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?"
7726,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1"," I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras?"
7727,LORAS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1", Yes.
7728,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1"," Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it."
7729,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1", You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
7730,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1", Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
7731,LORAS,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1", Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.
7732,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1", The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
7733,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1"," An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life."
7734,JOFFREY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1", My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger.
7735,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1"," You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery."
7736,MARGAERY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1"," Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need."
7737,JOFFREY,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1"," Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing."
7738,CERSEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1", I'm sure she does.
7739,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian)
7740,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.
7741,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, ( speaking Valyrian )
7742,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, They will stand until they drop.
7743,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, ( speaking Valyrian )
7744,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, Such is their obedience.
7745,DANAERYS,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training.
7746,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1," (speaking Valeryan) The Westrosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down. She wished to know how they are trained."
7747,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian) Tell her what she would know and be quick about it.
7748,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1," They begin their training at five. Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears. Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training."
7749,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian)
7750,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, Their discipline and loyalty are absolute. They fear nothing.
7751,JORAH,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, Even the bravest men fear death.
7752,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian)
7753,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian)
7754,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian) The knight says even brave men fear death.
7755,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian) Tell the old man he smells of piss.
7756,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1," (speaking Valyrian) Truly, master?"
7757,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1," (speaking Valyrian) No, not truly. Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing? (Continues in Valyrian)"
7758,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, My master says the Unsullied are not men. Death means nothing to them.
7759,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian) Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch.
7760,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1," He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace."
7761,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian)
7762,DAENERYS,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, Tell the good master there is no need.
7763,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, ( speaking Valyrian ) She's worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls?
7764,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, My master points out that men don't need nipples.
7765,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1," (speaking Valyrian) Here, I'm done with you."
7766,UNSULLIED,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian) This one is pleased to have served you.
7767,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian)
7768,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1," To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn, and kill it before its mother's eyes. This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them."
7769,DAENERYS,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1," You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?"
7770,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian) She is offended. She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby.
7771,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian) What a soft mewling fool this one is. (continues in Valyrian)
7772,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1," My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother."
7773,DAENERYS,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, How many do you have to sell?
7774,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian)
7775,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, Eight thousand.
7776,KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, (speaking Valyrian) Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow.
7777,MISSANDEI,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1, Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry. Many other buyers are interested.
7778,DAENERYS,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1, Eight thousand dead babies.
7779,JORAH,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1, The Unsullied are a means to an end.
7780,DAENERYS,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1," Once I own them, these men..."
7781,JORAH,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1, They're not men. Not anymore.
7782,DAENERYS,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1," Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?"
7783,JORAH,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1, Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
7784,JORAH,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1, You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
7785,JORAH,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1, You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.
7786,CHILD,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1, (hisses)
7787,DAENERYS,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1, (to JORAH) The warlocks.
7788,DAENERYS,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1," I owe you my life, Ser."
7789,BARRISTAN,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1," The honor is mine, my queen."
7790,DAENERYS,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1, You know this man?
7791,JORAH,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1, (Nods) I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.
7792,BARRISTAN,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1," King Robert is dead. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I was sworn to protect your family. I failed them."
7793,JON,3,22,dark wings dark words,Unnamed Scene_56," Don't think too much, Bran."
7794,JON,3,22,dark wings dark words,Unnamed Scene_56, Relax your bow arm.
7795,NED STARK,3,22,dark wings dark words,Unnamed Scene_56, (O.S.) And which one of you was a marksman at ten?
7796,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,Unnamed Scene_56, Father?
7797,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,Unnamed Scene_56," You can't kill it, you know."
7798,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,Unnamed Scene_56, Why not?
7799,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,Unnamed Scene_56,  Because the raven is you.
7800,HODOR,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1, Hodor.
7801,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1," It's all right, Hodor."
7802,HODOR,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1, Hodor.
7803,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1," Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?"
7804,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1," No, it was the three-eyed raven."
7805,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1, He's back.
7806,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1," I tried to kill it, but I couldn't. There was a boy."
7807,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1, I don't want to hear about it.
7808,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1, But you asked.
7809,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1, We've got plenty of worries. We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.
7810,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1, I didn't ask for black magic dreams.
7811,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1," I know you didn't, little lord."
7812,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1, We need to move.
7813,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1, We don't know who might be after us. No one even knows we're alive.
7814,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1, And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you?
7815,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1, No.
7816,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1," Some good he is, then."
7817,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1, I don't know what other people know and what they don't. I only know the Wall is a long way off.
7818,TALISA,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1," My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot. Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds."
7819,ROBB,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1, Did you ever think you'd marry one?
7820,TALISA,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1, I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.
7821,ROBB,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1, Never?
7822,TALISA,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1," Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians."
7823,ROOSE BOLTON,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1," Pardon me, Your Grace. My queen."
7824,TALISA,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1, Lord Bolton.
7825,ROBB,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1, Let me guess which one is the good news.
7826,ROOSE BOLTON,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1, Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.
7827,CATELYN,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9, I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.
7828,ROBB,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9, We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
7829,CATELYN,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9, Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
7830,CATELYN,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9, Something else?
7831,ROBB,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9," By the time Bolton's bastard Ramsay got to Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages."
7832,CATELYN,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9, Have you received any demands?
7833,ROBB,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9, No.
7834,CATELYN,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9, Have you heard anything from Theon at all?
7835,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1, Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?
7836,TORTURER,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1, I want to do this.
7837,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?
7838,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, Yes.
7839,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, So how shall we pass the time?
7840,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, By putting one foot in front of the other.
7841,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, It's going to be a very dull walk.
7842,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.
7843,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1," You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword."
7844,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1," If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman."
7845,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1, All the good it's done her.
7846,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
7847,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1"," Not your concern, Kingslayer."
7848,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
7849,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", How would you know?
7850,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
7851,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", Move.
7852,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", Were you pledged to Stannis?
7853,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1"," Gods, no."
7854,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1"," Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal."
7855,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", Shut your mouth.
7856,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1"," Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you."
7857,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1"," I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king."
7858,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", Sounds like you quite fancied him.
7859,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", I did not fancy him.
7860,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1"," Oh, gods, you did."
7861,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1"," Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid."
7862,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
7863,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", I'm not interested in foul rumors.
7864,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.
7865,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", Shut your mouth!
7866,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1"," I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love."
7867,MAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1"," Where are you headed, then?"
7868,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", South. You?
7869,MAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1"," Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win."
7870,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1"," No, you really can't."
7871,MAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1"," Looks like you're safe enough, though. Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you. Seven blessings to you."
7872,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", And you.
7873,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", He knows who I am.
7874,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", He doesn't.
7875,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", Maybe you're right.  But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?
7876,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.
7877,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1", More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
7878,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",  Make it tighter here.
7879,CERSEI,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", That's better. It makes you look very strong.
7880,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others.
7881,TAILOR,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1"," Yes, Your Grace."
7882,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", Bloody flowers. On the king.
7883,CERSEI,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.
7884,CERSEI,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", Tell me what you think of her.
7885,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", Who?
7886,CERSEI,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", Margaery.
7887,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1"," She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century."
7888,CERSEI,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1"," It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent."
7889,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1"," Yes, she is."
7890,CERSEI,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
7891,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", Not to me.
7892,CERSEI,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.
7893,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
7894,CERSEI,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
7895,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.
7896,CERSEI,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", You need to ask yourself
7897,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", I don't need to do anything.
7898,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1", Better. Much better.
7899,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3", I still don't believe it.
7900,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3", He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
7901,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3", Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
7902,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3", Littlefinger's not in love with me.
7903,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3", Love is not the thing he wants.
7904,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3", He's too old.
7905,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3", They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?
7906,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3", No.
7907,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3"," If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me."
7908,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3", Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.
7909,GUARD,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3"," Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady."
7910,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3", Send him in.
7911,LORAS,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3", Lady Sansa.
7912,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3", Ser Loras.
7913,LORAS,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3"," My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens. May I escort you to them?"
7914,LORAS,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"  I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa."
7915,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose."
7916,LORAS,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, Of course I did.
7917,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, (to a maid) It's more your color. You take it.
7918,MAID,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, Thank you.
7919,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, (to LORAS) You're such a dear.
7920,LORAS,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.
7921,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," Thank you, Ser Loras."
7922,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell."
7923,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," Kiss me, child."
7924,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.
7925,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant."
7926,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king."
7927,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras."
7928,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-
7929,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
7930,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?"
7931,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, Lemon cake's my favorite.
7932,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," So we've been told. (To the servant) Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others."
7933,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
7934,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, I haven't had the pleasure.
7935,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey."
7936,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," I-, I-"
7937,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?"
7938,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, Has he ripped out your tongue?
7939,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"  Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion"
7940,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?"
7941,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,  I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.
7942,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, Bring me some cheese.
7943,SERVANT,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady."
7944,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.
7945,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you."
7946,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, My father always told the truth.
7947,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head."
7948,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
7949,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, Go on.
7950,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.
7951,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her."
7952,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it."
7953,SANSA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, He's a monster.
7954,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1, Ah. That's a pity.

7956,OLENNA,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1," Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese."
7957,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1, We're at war. This march is a distraction.
7958,ROBB,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1, My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.
7959,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1, Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
7960,ROBB,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1, No.
7961,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1, Then it's a distraction.
7962,ROBB,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1, My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.
7963,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1," Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference."
7964,ROBB,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1, Have you lost faith in our cause?
7965,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,"  If it's revenge, I still got faith in it."
7966,ROBB,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1, If you no longer believe-
7967,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1, I can believe till it snows in Dorne. Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.
7968,ROBB,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1, You don't think we can win?
7969,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,"  May I speak my mind, Your Grace?"
7970,ROBB,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,"  Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?"
7971,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,  I think you lost this war the day you married her.
7972,TALISA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1"," Whoa, whoa."
7973,MAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1", Your Grace.
7974,CATELYN,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1", You're afraid of her. And she knows it.
7975,TALISA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1"," I'm not afraid of her. May I help you, Lady Stark?"
7976,CATELYN,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1", No.
7977,TALISA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1"," I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-"
7978,CATELYN,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1", You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.
7979,TALISA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1", You've made them before?
7980,CATELYN,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1", Twice.
7981,TALISA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1", Did they work?
7982,CATELYN,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1", After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.
7983,TALISA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1", (Nods)
7984,CATELYN,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1"," Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering."
7985,TALISA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1", Which boy?
7986,CATELYN,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1"," Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us."
7987,TALISA,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1", And he lived.
7988,CATELYN,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH_1", And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.
7989,MANCE,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_13, Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?
7990,JON,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_13, Yes.
7991,MANCE,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_13," You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people."
7992,JON,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_13, I understand.
7993,MANCE,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_13," Well, how could you understand?"
7994,JON,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_13,  You want to protect your people.
7995,MANCE,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_13," Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?"
7996,JON,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_13, No.
7997,MANCE,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_13, I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south. Because that's the truth.
7998,TORMUND,3,22,dark wings dark words,A CRAG NEXT TO THE MARCHING FORCES_1, Shouldn't be long now.
7999,JON,3,22,dark wings dark words,A CRAG NEXT TO THE MARCHING FORCES_1, What's wrong with him?
8000,MANCE,3,22,dark wings dark words,A CRAG NEXT TO THE MARCHING FORCES_1," He's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us."
8001,YGRITTE,3,22,dark wings dark words,A CRAG NEXT TO THE MARCHING FORCES_1," What, you've never met a warg?"
8002,MANCE,3,22,dark wings dark words,A CRAG NEXT TO THE MARCHING FORCES_1, Orell.
8003,MANCE,3,22,dark wings dark words,A CRAG NEXT TO THE MARCHING FORCES_1, Where were you this time?
8004,ORELL,3,22,dark wings dark words,A CRAG NEXT TO THE MARCHING FORCES_1,  The Fist of the First Men.
8005,MANCE,3,22,dark wings dark words,A CRAG NEXT TO THE MARCHING FORCES_1, What did you see?
8006,ORELL,3,22,dark wings dark words,A CRAG NEXT TO THE MARCHING FORCES_1, Dead crows.
8007,RAST,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15," What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold? There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering. That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole. Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to."
8008,GRENN,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15," Hey. Get up, Sam."
8009,SAM,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15, No.
8010,GRENN,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15, Get up.
8011,SAM,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15, I can't.
8012,GRENN,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15," If you stop, you'll die."
8013,DOLOROUS EDD,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15," 'Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too."
8014,SAM,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15, You don't care.
8015,DOLOROUS EDD,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15, 'Course we care.
8016,SAM,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15," You left me. When the white walkers came, you left me."
8017,DOLOROUS EDD,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15," Aye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow. We didn't want to die."
8018,GRENN,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15, Help me get him up.
8019,RAST,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15, Looks like that piggy is done for.
8020,GRENN,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15, Help us get him up.
8021,RAST,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15, He's slowing us down.
8022,GRENN,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15, Just get him up!
8023,RAST,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15,  Why? So the rest of us can die? We'll move faster without him.
8024,JEOR,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15," What is this? Get up, Tarly. Is he all right?"
8025,GRENN,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15,"  Aye, I think so."
8026,RAST,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15," If he can't, we may as well just go without him."
8027,JEOR,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15," That's enough. Tarly, I forbid you to die. Do you hear me?"
8028,SAM,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15, (nods)
8029,RAST,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15, Why should the rest of us-
8030,JEOR,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15," Rast, you're responsible for him."
8031,RAST,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15, What am I supposed to do?
8032,JEOR,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15," Make sure he gets back alive. If he doesn't, you don't. Move on!"
8033,RAST,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_15,"  I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me?"
8034,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,WOODS IN THE NORTH_1, Where's Rickon and Hodor?
8035,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,WOODS IN THE NORTH_1, Looking for food.
8036,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,WOODS IN THE NORTH_1, What's out there?
8037,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,WOODS IN THE NORTH_1,"  Not another step, boy. Unless you want to drown in your own blood."
8038,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,WOODS IN THE NORTH_1, I'm unarmed.
8039,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,WOODS IN THE NORTH_1, That was poor planning.
8040,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,WOODS IN THE NORTH_1, My sister carries the weapons.
8041,MEERA,3,22,dark wings dark words,WOODS IN THE NORTH_1, I'm better with them. Drop the spear.
8042,MEERA,3,22,dark wings dark words,WOODS IN THE NORTH_1, Drop it.
8043,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,WOODS IN THE NORTH_1," If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits."
8044,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,WOODS IN THE NORTH_1, You must be SUMMER.
8045,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,WOODS IN THE NORTH_1," I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera. We've come a long way to find you, Brandon. And we have much farther to go."
8046,GENDRY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, I'm just trying to understand.
8047,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Would you please shut up about it?
8048,GENDRY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.
8049,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, I'm not listening.
8050,GENDRY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.
8051,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Shut up.
8052,GENDRY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, You could have picked Tywin Lannister.
8053,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3," Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?"
8054,GENDRY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, But you could have ended the war.
8055,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Where are we going?
8056,GENDRY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, North.
8057,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3," If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now."
8058,GENDRY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Maybe we already passed it.
8059,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3," It's a hundred feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather, he's a lord. He'll protect us."
8060,GENDRY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Could be a minstrel.
8061,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Shut up.
8062,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, A lion still has claws...
8063,HOT PIE,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3,"  A minstrel's got gold sometimes. We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food."
8064,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Shh.
8065,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3," And so he spoke, and so he spoke"
8066,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?
8067,ANGUY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3,"  Just a dirty little cub, I think."
8068,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Loose a few more shafts.
8069,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Don't.
8070,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3," Put the sword down, girl."
8071,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you.
8072,ANGUY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Generous.
8073,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, You're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy?
8074,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, What friends?
8075,ANGUY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3,  The fat to your left and the lad beside him.
8076,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal?
8077,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Who are you?
8078,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.
8079,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3," No, who do you fight for?"
8080,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3,  The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
8081,HOT PIE,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.
8082,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3," You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way."
8083,ANGUY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3," Here's the thing, fat"
8084,ANGUY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3," When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head. So I advise you move, because I'm done talking."
8085,ANGUY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Half the country's starving and look at this one.
8086,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3, Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.
8087,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", My lion.
8088,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.
8089,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", But you said I should come to you with any problems.
8090,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", Did anyone see you? No.
8091,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", No.
8092,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.
8093,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", All right. What is this problem?
8094,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7","  I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him."
8095,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", Baelish doesn't have friends.
8096,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", I don't know her name.
8097,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7"," Oh, Ros? The redhead?"
8098,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", How do you know her?
8099,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.
8100,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", She's a whore.
8101,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7"," Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things."
8102,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", You fucked her.
8103,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7"," Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice."
8104,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7"," But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else."
8105,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", And was she good? Did you like her?
8106,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7"," Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?"
8107,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
8108,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
8109,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", We have to protect her.
8110,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7"," We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name."
8111,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7"," A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?"
8112,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7"," Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you."
8113,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", You pervert. You want her? This child?
8114,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7",  I don't even want to talk about her.
8115,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", But you are.
8116,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", Only because you're making me.
8117,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
8118,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
8119,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7"," Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."
8120,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7"," Hmm, yes."
8121,SHAE,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", Now do you think I'm cruel?
8122,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.
8123,TYRION,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7", Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.
8124,GUARD,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3"," Lady Tyrell, my king."
8125,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", Send her in.
8126,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3"," You wanted to see me, Your Grace?"
8127,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
8128,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3"," That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want."
8129,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.
8130,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.
8131,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?
8132,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3"," Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all."
8133,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
8134,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.
8135,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", You failed to do this.
8136,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3"," Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace."
8137,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?
8138,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
8139,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", What makes you say this?
8140,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3"," Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me."
8141,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3"," No, he was a known degenerate."
8142,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3"," It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace."
8143,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
8144,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.
8145,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", You are the king.
8146,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", Yes. I am.
8147,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
8148,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
8149,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",  It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.
8150,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", The bolt goes here.
8151,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", And then you just aim and-
8152,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3"," Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman."
8153,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", It's not unheard of.
8154,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", My father would never let me before-
8155,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it?
8156,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",  May I? Please.
8157,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
8158,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", Could you do it? Could you kill something?.
8159,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3","  I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?"
8160,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", Yes.
8161,MARGAERY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", Would you like to watch me?
8162,JOFFREY,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3", Yes.
8163,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, Stop! Stop!
8164,TORTURER,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, Tell us the truth.
8165,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, (screaming) About what?
8166,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, I don't know what you want.
8167,TORTURER,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, I want the truth.
8168,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, What truth?
8169,TORTURER,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, Why'd you take Winterfell?
8170,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, I took it to-I took it-
8171,TORTURER,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, Who gave the orders?
8172,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, No one. I took it on my own.
8173,TORTURER,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, Why?
8174,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, To take the North while it was vulnerable.
8175,TORTURER,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, What were you going to do once you took it?
8176,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, Hold it. Rule it.
8177,TORTURER,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, Good. That's very good.
8178,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, Why did you do that?
8179,TORTURER,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,  I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?
8180,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,  I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
8181,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3," (panicking) Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them."
8182,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, What are you doing?
8183,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, Please.
8184,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3," I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off."
8185,RAMSAY,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, Your sister sent me.
8186,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, Yara?
8187,RAMSAY,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3, I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
8188,THEON,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3," No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go."
8189,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7," Rickon, stay with us."
8190,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, It's all right. The wolves will protect him.
8191,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7," You can get inside his head, see through his eyes."
8192,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, Only when I'm asleep.
8193,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.
8194,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-
8195,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, A three-eyed raven?
8196,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, You've seen it?
8197,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,  We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?
8198,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, Does it have anything to do with warging?
8199,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,"  No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight."
8200,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, Seeing things that haven't happened yet?
8201,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,  Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
8202,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, What's he telling him?
8203,MEERA,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, Why don't you ask?
8204,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,"  Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?"
8205,MEERA,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, Where's the shame in that?
8206,OSHA,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
8207,MEERA,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.
8208,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7," When my father died, I dreamt it."
8209,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.
8210,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7," You have the sight, too?"
8211,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7," (Nods) When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry."
8212,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.
8213,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, Yeah.
8214,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, He saved my father's life during the rebellion.
8215,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7," Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too."
8216,BRAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7, What else have you seen?
8217,JOJEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,  Only one thing that matters-you.
8218,MAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1," I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand."
8219,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, I don't drink ale.
8220,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.
8221,MAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, Yeah!
8222,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1," You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-"
8223,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, We're not children.
8224,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1," How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?"
8225,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
8226,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1," A smith, eh? Where'd you train?"
8227,GENDRY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
8228,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.
8229,GENDRY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, That's because he's twice as good.
8230,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, Aha! A smith and a salesman.
8231,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, Gendry stole us weapons.
8232,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1," Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see."
8233,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
8234,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, My brothers taught me.
8235,MEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, Ooh!
8236,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, To your brothers!
8237,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, You can finish your meals before you go. It may be awhile before you see another.
8238,ARYA,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, You'll free us?
8239,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, I gave you my word.
8240,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1," But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-"
8241,ANGUY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1," Hey, hey."
8242,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, Now that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
8243,ANGUY,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
8244,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, Poor man. You have my sympathy.
8245,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1," Aha, not a man at all. A Hound!"
8246,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1," So good to see you again, Clegane."
8247,THE HOUND,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, Thoros? The fuck you doing here?
8248,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.
8249,THOROS,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1," A pretty prize, lads."
8250,MEN,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, Yeah!
8251,THE HOUND,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, Girl.
8252,THE HOUND,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1, (to Thoros) What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?
8253,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_5,  It's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
8254,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_5," Silence, Kingslayer."
8255,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_5," Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river."
8256,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_5, Good luck.
8257,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_5, It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?
8258,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1, Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.
8259,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1, Be quick about it.
8260,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1, I need to rest.
8261,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1, Get up.
8262,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1," I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?"
8263,BRIENNE,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1, Get up now.
8264,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1," Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year."
8265,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1, This heel is ruined. There's no way-
8266,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,  I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
8267,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1, Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.
8268,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1, You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.
8269,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1," Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you."
8270,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1," You're good. Graceless, but good."
8271,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1," See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there."
8272,LOCKE,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1," Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman."
8273,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1, We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.
8274,LOCKE,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1, You sure he's the one?
8275,MAN,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,"  That's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding."
8276,LOCKE,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1, Give the man his silver.
8277,JAIME,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1, Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
8278,LOCKE,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1," Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours."
8279,EDMURE,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1"," If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-"
8280,BRYNDEN,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1"," Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him ""nephew."" He is your king."
8281,EDMURE,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", Robb knows I meant him no disr-
8282,BRYNDEN,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", You're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
8283,EDMURE,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1"," My blunder sent Tywin's mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around."
8284,ROBB,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
8285,EDMURE,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", I seized an opportunity.
8286,ROBB,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", What value was the mill?
8287,EDMURE,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
8288,ROBB,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", Is he there now? Of course not.
8289,EDMURE,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.
8290,ROBB,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1"," I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill."
8291,EDMURE,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.
8292,ROBB,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", Willem and Martyn Lannister are fourteen years old.
8293,BRYNDEN,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1"," Martyn is fifteen, I believe."
8294,ROBB,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?
8295,EDMURE,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", No.
8296,ROBB,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?
8297,EDMURE,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", No.
8298,ROBB,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", How many men did you lose?
8299,EDMURE,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1","  But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-"
8300,ROBB,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
8301,EDMURE,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", I'm sorry. I didn't know.
8302,ROBB,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1",  You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
8303,BRYNDEN,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", We seem to be running short of patience here.
8304,ROBB,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1", You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
8305,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1", Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
8306,TYWIN,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1", What news of Jaime?
8307,TYWIN,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1"," Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?"
8308,VARYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1"," We are trying, my lord."
8309,TYWIN,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1","  Try harder. What do we have, then?"
8310,VARYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1"," Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name."
8311,TYWIN,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1","  Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn."
8312,LITTLEFINGER,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1"," For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord.  Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me."
8313,PYCELLE,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1", A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
8314,LITTLEFINGER,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1", Titles do seem to breed titles.
8315,TYWIN,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1", You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
8316,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1"," Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended."
8317,TYWIN,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1", Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
8318,CERSEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1", (chuckles)
8319,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1", Master of Coin?
8320,TYWIN,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1",  It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
8321,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1"," I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it."
8322,CERSEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1", I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
8323,PYCELLE,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1"," Hear, hear."
8324,MEN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5," (singing) He lifted her high in the air. He sniffed and roared and smelled her there. She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair. But he licked the honey from her hair. From there to here, from here to there. All black and brown and covered with hair. He smelled that girl in the summer air. The bear, the bear and the maiden fair."
8325,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5," I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us."
8326,BRIENNE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5, You were armed when we were taken.
8327,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5, I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
8328,BRIENNE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5," All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable."
8329,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5, I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.
8330,BRIENNE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5, And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.
8331,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5, You were not beating me.
8332,BRIENNE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5, Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
8333,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5," When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist."
8334,BRIENNE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,  Would I?
8335,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5, They'll knock your teeth out.
8336,BRIENNE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5, You think I care about my teeth?
8337,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5," No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?"
8338,BRIENNE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5, What does it matter?
8339,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5, Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.
8340,BRIENNE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5," If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted?"
8341,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,"  If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods."
8342,GENDRY,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7," If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new."
8343,THOROS,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
8344,ARYA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
8345,THOROS,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7," You're not our prisoner, little lady."
8346,ARYA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, What am I?
8347,THOROS,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, Our guest. No one's put any chains on you.
8348,ARYA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7," So I can walk away, then?"
8349,THOROS,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter. You're lucky we found you.
8350,THE HOUND,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7," You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?"
8351,ANGUY,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, Better than anyone you've ever met.
8352,THE HOUND,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, A coward's weapon. I like to fight up close. I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.
8353,ANGUY,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, Why? So you can kiss him?
8354,ARYA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,  You remember the last time you were here?
8355,THE HOUND,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, Looks like every other shit inn on the road.
8356,ANGUY,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7," Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more."
8357,ANGUY,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, (sarcastically) Watch your head. Off we go.
8358,DRIVER,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, Walk up!
8359,ARYA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,  What are you doing? We're about to leave.
8360,HOT PIE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, I'm staying.
8361,GENDRY,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, You're what?
8362,HOT PIE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7," I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better. Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him. Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king. I'm not a Stark of ""Winterhell""."
8363,ARYA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, Winterfell.
8364,HOT PIE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, You sure?
8365,ARYA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, I'm sure.
8366,HOT PIE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7," Well, I made you something."
8367,ARYA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, What is it?
8368,HOT PIE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,  It's a wolf.
8369,GENDRY,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7," Yes, it is."
8370,ARYA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, That's the tail?
8371,HOT PIE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, Yeah.
8372,GENDRY,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7," Well, be safe."
8373,HOT PIE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7," Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed."
8374,GENDRY,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7, You don't burn your fingers.
8375,ARYA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7," Good-bye, Hot Pie."
8376,HOT PIE,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7," Good-bye, Arry."
8377,MAN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7," Up you go, little lady."
8378,ARYA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7," Hey, Hot Pie. It's really good."
8379,CATELYN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1, A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.
8380,BRYNDEN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1," It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening."
8381,CATELYN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1," I've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words-"
8382,BRYNDEN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1, Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox. I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience.
8383,CATELYN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1, I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?
8384,BRYNDEN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1," After thirty years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it. He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish. He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with. I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name."
8385,CATELYN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1," Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say. 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again."
8386,BRYNDEN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1, You mustn't think it. We don't know the truth. They could be in hiding. Robb believes they're alive. And he must go on believing. He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail. And you must remain strong for him.
8387,CATELYN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1, (sighs)
8388,MARTYN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1, You're Robb Stark's wife.
8389,TALISA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1, Hold still.
8390,MARTYN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1, Is it true what they say about him?
8391,TALISA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1, I don't know. What do they say about him?
8392,MARTYN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1, That he can turn into a wolf at night.
8393,TALISA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1, True.
8394,MARTYN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1, And he eats the flesh of his enemies.
8395,TALISA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1," True. You're a Lannister, aren't you?"
8396,MARTYN,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1, Martyn Lannister.
8397,TALISA,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1," Martyn Lannister. You've nothing to fear. My husband doesn't eat children. Unless it's a full moon. It's not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear."
8398,MANCE,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17, Always the artists.
8399,JON,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17, It's only horses. No men.
8400,YGRITTE,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17, You said there was dead crows.
8401,ORELL,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17, There was.
8402,MANCE,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17, How many men were here?
8403,JON,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17, About three hundred.
8404,MANCE,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17, And you know what those men are now?
8405,JON,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17, (nods)
8406,MANCE,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17, We're all the same to them - meat for their army.
8407,JON,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17, Do you think anyone got away?
8408,MANCE,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17," It's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont. But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north. And he lost. His best fighting men are dead. And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home. Tormund. Climb the Wall. Take Orell and twenty good men. And take this one. He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us. And if he's useful, good. If not throw him off the Wall. See if crows can fly."
8409,TORMUND,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17," We're finally going to war, old friend?"
8410,MANCE,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17," Hide near Castle Black. When I give the signal, hit them in the night. They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side."
8411,TORMUND,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,  We'll meet again.
8412,MANCE,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,  Aye. If you do your job. Ah.
8413,ORELL,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17, How will we see your signal?
8414,MANCE,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17," Send your eagle above the Wall every night. When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen."
8415,SAM,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_3", Ghost?
8416,CRASTER,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_3", What have we here? Frozen crows?
8417,JEOR,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_3", We've come a long way.
8418,CRASTER,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_3", Smaller flock than you went north with.
8419,JEOR,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_3", We can talk inside.
8420,CRASTER,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_3"," Oh, can we?"
8421,WOMAN,3,23,walk of punishment,CRASTER'S KEEP_1, They need some water.
8422,WOMAN #2,3,23,walk of punishment,CRASTER'S KEEP_1, Tether it and I'll be inside.
8423,CRASTER,3,23,walk of punishment,CRASTER'S KEEP_1, Keep your eyes where they belong. They're not for you.
8424,KARL TANNER,3,23,walk of punishment,CRASTER'S KEEP_1, Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
8425,CRASTER,3,23,walk of punishment,CRASTER'S KEEP_1," Aye, pig's got value to me. You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in. I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man."
8426,JEOR,3,23,walk of punishment,CRASTER'S KEEP_1, You are a godly man?
8427,CRASTER,3,23,walk of punishment,CRASTER'S KEEP_1," I am. I got no fear of what's out there. When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you. The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods. The real gods."
8428,CRASTER,3,23,walk of punishment,CRASTER'S KEEP_1," Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist. Women. That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight. Barely a grunt. (Pointing to SAM) And she's almost as fat as this one here.  Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go. Well, look at him. He's a walking feast."
8429,WOMAN,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, COURTYARD_1", Here we are.
8430,WOMAN #2,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, COURTYARD_1"," Sharpen these for me, would ya?"
8431,WOMAN #3,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, COURTYARD_1", I see the head. Push.
8432,WOMAN,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, COURTYARD_1", That's it. You're nearly there. One more push should do it.
8433,GILLY,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, COURTYARD_1", (desperate) What is it? What is it?
8434,RAMSAY,3,23,walk of punishment,"DUNGEON, NIGHT_1", Keep quiet.
8435,RAMSEY,3,23,walk of punishment,"DUNGEON, NIGHT_1"," If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance."
8436,THEON,3,23,walk of punishment,"DUNGEON, NIGHT_1", I can ride.
8437,RAMSAY,3,23,walk of punishment,"DUNGEON, NIGHT_1", You're sure?
8438,RAMSAY,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, Ride east. Follow the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you.
8439,THEON,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.
8440,RAMSAY,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, We're not in the Iron Islands. Go.
8441,THEON,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
8442,MAN,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, Come on back.
8443,STANNIS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, You refuse to tell me where you're going?
8444,MELISANDRE,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, I don't know yet. The fires will show me.
8445,STANNIS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,  How long will you be gone?
8446,MELISANDRE,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, I don't know.
8447,STANNIS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, You're abandoning me.
8448,MELISANDRE,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, I will never abandon you. You are the Son of Fire.  I am sworn to serve you.
8449,STANNIS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,  Then serve me.
8450,MELISANDRE,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," When I return, you will understand."
8451,STANNIS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son.
8452,MELISANDRE,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, I cannot.
8453,STANNIS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, Why?
8454,MELISANDRE,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, You don't have the strength. It would kill you.
8455,STANNIS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.
8456,STANNIS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, (whispering) I want you.
8457,MELISANDRE,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," Your fires burn low, my king."
8458,MELISANDRE,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, There is another way. A better way.
8459,STANNIS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, You told me your magic requires a king's blood.
8460,MELISANDRE,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,  Yes.
8461,STANNIS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,  I'm the one true king.
8462,MELISANDRE,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," You are. But there are others with your blood in their veins. You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices. The Lord of Light demands it."
8463,BARRISTAN,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace."
8464,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, To whom?
8465,BARRISTAN,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.
8466,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, Give me your water.
8467,JORAH,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death."
8468,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," Here, drink."
8469,BARRISTAN,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," Leave this place, Your Grace. Leave tonight, I beg you."
8470,JORAH,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, And what is she to do for soldiers?
8471,BARRISTAN,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.
8472,JORAH,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," Is it 'we' already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done."
8473,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents."
8474,JORAH,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?"
8475,BARRISTAN,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, Three.
8476,JORAH,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,  Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?
8477,BARRISTAN,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, (shakes his head)
8478,JORAH,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."
8479,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?"
8480,BARRISTAN,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction. I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace. I bled beside him."
8481,JORAH,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died."
8482,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?"
8483,BARRISTAN,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1," I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met."
8484,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1, I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon.
8485,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1"," All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?"
8486,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", They did not. I want to buy them all.
8487,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", (speaking Valerian) She wants to buy them all.
8488,KRAZNYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1"," (speaking Valerian) She can't afford them. The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants."
8489,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", There are eight thousand Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all?
8490,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", Yes. eight thousand. And the ones still in training as well.
8491,GREIZHEN,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1"," (speaking Valerian) If they fail on the battlefield, they will shame Astapor."
8492,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1"," Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys. If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor."
8493,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.
8494,KRAZNYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", (speaking Valerian) The slut cannot pay for all of this.
8495,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
8496,KRAZNYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1"," (speaking Valerian) Her ship will buy her a hundred Unsullied, no more."
8497,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous.
8498,KRAZNYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", (speaking Valerian) And this is because I like the curve of her ass.
8499,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", The gold you have left is worth ten.
8500,KRAZNYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", (speaking Valerian) What is left will buy her ten. I will give her twenty if it stops her ignorant whimpering.
8501,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", But good Master Kraznys will give you twenty.
8502,KRAZNYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", (speaking Valerian) Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed.
8503,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", The Dothraki you have with you-
8504,KRAZNYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", (speaking Valerian) I will give her three for those.
8505,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1"," The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them."
8506,KRAZNYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1"," (speaking Valerian) So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?"
8507,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1"," Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied."
8508,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", I have dragons. I'll give you one.
8509,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", (speaking Valerian)
8510,BARRISTAN,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1"," You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace."
8511,JORAH,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1"," Khaleesi, please."
8512,KRAZNYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", Three dragons.
8513,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1",  One.
8514,KRAZNYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1",  Two.
8515,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", One.
8516,KRAZNYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", (speaking Valerian)
8517,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1", They want the biggest one.
8518,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1",  Done.
8519,KRAZNYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1",  Done.
8520,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1"," I'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck."
8521,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,"ASTAPOR, BUILDING COURTYARD_1"," (speaking Valerian) She asks that you give me to her, as a present. She asks that you do this now."
8522,JORAH,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1," Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army."
8523,BARRISTAN,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1, Aegon Targaryen proved that.
8524,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1," You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood?"
8525,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1, Do you have a name?
8526,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1," This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace."
8527,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1, Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?
8528,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1," No, Your Grace. No family living."
8529,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1, You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.
8530,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1," Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense. Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less."
8531,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1, I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.'
8532,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1," There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace."
8533,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1, Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?
8534,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1," All questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all. Once they are yours, they are yours. They will fall on their swords if you command it."
8535,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1, And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed.
8536,MISSANDEI,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1, Valar morghulis.
8537,DAENERYS,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD_1," Yes, all men must die. But we are not men."
8538,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1, A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
8539,LITTLEFINGER,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1, I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city.
8540,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1, Not for bastards.
8541,ROS,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1," That's all of them, my lord."
8542,LITTLEFINGER,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1," Thank you, my dear."
8543,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1, Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.
8544,PODRICK,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1,"  Yes, my lord."
8545,LITTLEFINGER,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1, I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
8546,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1," Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid."
8547,LITTLEFINGER,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1, You should have him knighted.
8548,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1, If only the Master of Coin had such power.
8549,LITTLEFINGER,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1, If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.
8550,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1," Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding."
8551,LITTLEFINGER,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1," Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship."
8552,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1, We don't. I did fuck her once.
8553,LITTLEFINGER,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1,  I know.
8554,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1,  But we don't.
8555,LITTLEFINGER,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1, I know. But how would the queen get that idea?
8556,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1, Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
8557,LITTLEFINGER,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1, Keep a low profile.
8558,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1," If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are."
8559,LITTLEFINGER,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1," Well, you are richer than I am."
8560,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1, Good point.
8561,LITTLEFINGER,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1," They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores."
8562,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL_1," I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie."
8563,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Come on, I'm here later. Come on."
8564,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading."
8565,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, You think all reading is dull reading.
8566,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
8567,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.
8568,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.
8569,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Unless he made it all up, yes. Podrick, do keep up."
8570,PODRICK,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Yes, my lord."
8571,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, Podrick.
8572,PODRICK,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Yes, my lord?"
8573,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?"
8574,PODRICK,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," No, my lord."
8575,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1,  Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.
8576,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," She's not bad with second-timers, either."
8577,PODRICK,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Uh, my lord"
8578,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?"
8579,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me."
8580,MAREI,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, He's handsome. You didn't tell me he was handsome.
8581,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
8582,PODRICK,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," My lord, I don't even"
8583,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.
8584,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, Be back in time for my supper.
8585,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Pace yourself, lad."
8586,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold."
8587,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, Let me guess. He's not a magician.
8588,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, No.
8589,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1,  He's stealing it?
8590,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Worse, he's borrowing it."
8591,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, What's wrong with that?
8592,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father."
8593,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt."
8594,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive."
8595,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
8596,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest."
8597,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, And what if I don't?
8598,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Well, you have to."
8599,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, But what if I don't?
8600,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back."
8601,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?"
8602,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, The lad's practically skipping.
8603,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?
8604,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year."
8605,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, He's a squire. You don't pay him.
8606,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year."
8607,PODRICK,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," They wouldn't take it, my lord."
8608,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.
8609,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
8610,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, What did you tell them?
8611,PODRICK,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, I didn't tell them anything.
8612,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1,  What did you do to them?
8613,PODRICK,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, Lots of things.
8614,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, And they seemed to like these things?
8615,PODRICK,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Yes, my lord."
8616,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.
8617,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, Only they weren't paid.
8618,BRONN,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?"
8619,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, Is that what you're telling us?
8620,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Sit down, Podrick."
8621,TYRION,3,23,walk of punishment,HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, We're going to need details. Copious details.
8622,THEON,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on.

8631,RAMSAY,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1"," Come, my lord."
8632,RAMSAY,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", You're a long way from home and winter is coming.
8633,LOCKE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1"," I'll take the big bitch first. When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off."
8634,BRIENNE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1"," My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth. Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing."
8635,LOCKE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt. Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive. Nobody said shit about you.
8636,MAN,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", You're only making it worse.
8637,LOCKE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", Take her over there where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy.
8638,MAN,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", Come on!
8639,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1"," You know who she is, don't you?"
8640,LOCKE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", A big dumb bitch from who cares where. Never been with a woman that big.
8641,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?
8642,MAN,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", I'm gonna cut your throat!
8643,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.
8644,LOCKE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", I know what they are.
8645,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1"," Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched."
8646,LOCKE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", Bring her back here.
8647,MAN,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1"," Yes, my lord. Get up."

8651,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", Not defiled.
8652,LOCKE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", Fancy word for a fancy man.
8653,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1"," I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words."
8654,LOCKE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", I bet you did.
8655,BRIENNE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", (screams)
8656,LOCKE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1"," Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?"
8657,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1"," You'll be a rich man till the end of your days. And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them. Lands, titles- you'll have them all. The North can't win this war. You're a smart man. You understand that. We have the numbers. We have the gold."
8658,LOCKE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1"," Aye, you have both."
8659,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
8660,LOCKE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", Hard to argue with that.
8661,JAIME,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1"," Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once."
8662,LOCKE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1", None of us are. Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.
8663,MAN,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1"," Come on, men."

8676,LOCKE,3,23,walk of punishment,"HILLS SOMEWHERE, MORNING/b>_1"," Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing. You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here. Never forget that."

8678,MAN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,Unnamed Scene_57, How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
8679,LOCKE,3,24,and now his watch is ended,Unnamed Scene_57," Depends if he's had any practice. Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us?"
8680,BRIENNE,3,24,and now his watch is ended,Unnamed Scene_57, He's going to fall. He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.
8681,JAIME,3,24,and now his watch is ended,Unnamed Scene_57," (desperately) Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please."

8689,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17," Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in."
8690,TYRION,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17, I hope we might speak. In confidence.
8691,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17," Oh, always in confidence."
8692,TYRION,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17, About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?
8693,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17," Oh, no. It's a wonderful time."
8694,TYRION,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17, I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-
8695,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17, End your life?
8696,TYRION,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17," I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof."
8697,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17, Proof? Will there be a trial?
8698,TYRION,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17, I need to know.
8699,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17," I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?"
8700,TYRION,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17, I don't know. Do I?
8701,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17," As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."
8702,TYRION,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17," Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-"
8703,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17, You do not possess at the moment.
8704,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17," But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special."
8705,TYRION,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17, The sorcerer.
8706,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17," Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it."
8707,GRENN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3," When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling."
8708,DOLOROUS EDD,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3, Or the shit.
8709,GRENN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3," They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it."
8710,DOLOROUS EDD,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3, And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that.
8711,GRENN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3," But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling."
8712,DOLOROUS EDD,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3," Oh, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day."
8713,RAST,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3, We need to get out of here.
8714,GRENN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3," When the Lord Commander says we go, we go."
8715,RAST,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3, The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us?
8716,DOLOROUS EDD,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3, He had no way of knowing.
8717,RAST,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3, We do now. We know what's out there.
8718,GRENN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3, Craster's been out here surviving.
8719,RAST,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3, So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?
8720,DOLOROUS EDD,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3, We're like the sons he never had.
8721,RAST,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3," Mormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves."
8722,GILLY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5," Shh, shh, shh."
8723,GILLY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5, You woke him.
8724,SAM,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5, I'm sorry. He's beautiful.
8725,GILLY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5, Shh!
8726,SAM,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5, He's beautiful.  Does he have a name?
8727,GILLY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5, No.
8728,SAM,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5, Are you going to give him one?
8729,GILLY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5, Why?
8730,GILLY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5, Here.
8731,SAM,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5, Gilly.
8732,GILLY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5, You said to hold it for you until you came back. You're back.
8733,SAM,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5, I wanted you to have it.
8734,GILLY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5, I don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you?
8735,GILLY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5, I don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.
8736,JOJEN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"WOODS, SOMEWHERE_1", You have to go after him.
8737,BRAN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"WOODS, SOMEWHERE_1", How?
8738,JOJEN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"WOODS, SOMEWHERE_1", You know how.
8739,CATELYN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"WOODS, SOMEWHERE_1", Brandon.
8740,BRAN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"WOODS, SOMEWHERE_1", Mother.
8741,CATELYN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"WOODS, SOMEWHERE_1", How many times have I told you? No climbing.
8742,BRAN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"WOODS, SOMEWHERE_1"," Mother, I need to find it. It's here. It's calling me."
8743,CATELYN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"WOODS, SOMEWHERE_1", I want you to promise me. No more climbing.
8744,CATELYN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"WOODS, SOMEWHERE_1", Promise me. Promise me! Promise me!
8745,BRAN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"WOODS, SOMEWHERE_1", Mother! Mother!
8746,CATELYN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"WOODS, SOMEWHERE_1"," Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me!"
8747,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, Is he very large?
8748,ROS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19," No larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was-"
8749,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, Extraordinary.
8750,ROS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men.
8751,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?
8752,ROS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, (nods)
8753,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, What did he do to them?
8754,ROS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19," I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive."
8755,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, So what did they say?
8756,ROS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, They said it was hard to describe.
8757,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
8758,ROS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
8759,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19," Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?"
8760,ROS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19," He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest."
8761,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, What makes you say so?
8762,ROS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, His shipboard inventory.
8763,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
8764,ROS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, Former profession.
8765,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
8766,ROS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
8767,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
8768,ROS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19," He's not interested in them, my lord."
8769,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, How do you know?
8770,ROS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, Because I'm one of his girls.
8771,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19, Prodigies in odd places indeed.
8772,JOFFREY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1"," Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon. It ate her while her son watched. What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there."
8773,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1"," The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats seven hundred comfortably."
8774,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1",  There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.
8775,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", There aren't more than seven hundred people of any importance.
8776,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1"," No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the seven hundred to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats."
8777,JOFFREY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1"," Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen. Aerion Brightflame, they called him. He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon."
8778,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", (laughs)
8779,JOFFREY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1"," He was wrong. And, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle. Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?"
8780,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre?
8781,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1"," Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace. I'd love to see their tombs, really. It's like taking a walk through history."
8782,JOFFREY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", The tomb's just up here.
8783,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", This is so exciting.
8784,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1"," You were married here, Your Grace?"
8785,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", Yes.
8786,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", Must seem like only yesterday.
8787,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", Seems like a lifetime ago.
8788,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1"," Your husband, was he buried here as well?"
8789,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1"," No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End."
8790,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", Such a tragedy.
8791,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", A fairly predictable tragedy. Hunting and drinking don't mix.
8792,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", I should say not. My son's a hunter. It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle.
8793,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year.
8794,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.
8795,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", (chuckles)
8796,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1"," I told him to stay out of Robert's Rebellion. He had no business fighting an actual warrior. We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave. But they do seem to yearn for it. We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing."
8797,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", And yet the world belongs to them.
8798,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1"," A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind."
8799,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", (laughs)
8800,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1", The gods have seen fit to make it so.
8801,JOFFREY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,THE TOMBS_1," My father didn't want them here. He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise."
8802,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,THE TOMBS_1," I'm glad he did. I'm sorry, Your Grace. I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this. Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness."
8803,JOFFREY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,THE TOMBS_1, I couldn't agree more.
8804,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,THE TOMBS_1," Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold. I've spoken with them. I know how they feel about you. You led the defense of King's Landing. They adore you."
8805,JOFFREY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,THE TOMBS_1, Open the doors.
8806,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,THE TOMBS_1, Joffrey. Wait.

8819,THEON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,NORTHERN WOODS_1, How far is it to Deepwood Motte?
8820,RAMSAY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,NORTHERN WOODS_1," Not far, my lord. Your sister is waiting for you there."
8821,THEON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,NORTHERN WOODS_1, She sent you to save me?
8822,RAMSAY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,NORTHERN WOODS_1," Yes. I served them, the men who were torturing you. I did what they told me and waited for the right moment."
8823,THEON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,NORTHERN WOODS_1, Why would you risk your life for me?
8824,RAMSAY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,NORTHERN WOODS_1," I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord. I was only a boy when they took you away. My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off. I remember the look on my father's face when he told us, 'That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son.' And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you."
8825,THEON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,NORTHERN WOODS_1," Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me. Did he?"
8826,RAMSAY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,NORTHERN WOODS_1," I- I don't know, my lord. They- they never told me much."
8827,THEON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", My sister's men are loyal to her. We don't need to hide from them.

8830,RAMSAY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", What is it?
8831,THEON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place.
8832,RAMSAY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", What did he tell you to do?
8833,THEON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", Raid fishing villages. He didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark. Ha. I could never be a Stark. Robb Stark always reminded me of that.
8834,RAMSAY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", He lorded it over you?
8835,THEON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", Didn't have to. All he had to do was be. Be who he was born to be. His life fit him better than his clothes. How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? He's the King in the North.
8836,THEON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1"," And me my father gave me a choice and I made it. I could never be a Stark. But ironborn, that's what I was born to be. I paid the iron price for Winterfell. I murdered those boys."
8837,RAMSAY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", The Stark boys?
8838,THEON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", Never found them. Just some poor orphans living with a farmer. I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud.
8839,RAMSAY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", Maybe it's not too late.
8840,THEON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", It is. My real father lost his head at King's Landing. I made a choice and I chose wrong. And now I've burned everything down.
8841,RAMSAY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1"," Not everything, my lord. She's up here."
8842,THEON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", Yara.
8843,RAMSAY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", Shh. Wait.
8844,RAMSAY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", I brought him back. He killed the others.
8845,THEON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1"," What? No, I didn't."
8846,THEON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1"," You can't! No, please stop! No!"
8847,RAMSAY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1", Put him back where he belongs.
8848,BRIENNE,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1", Eat. What are you doing?
8849,JAIME,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1", I'm dying.
8850,BRIENNE,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1", You can't die. You need to live to take revenge.
8851,JAIME,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1", I don't care about revenge.
8852,BRIENNE,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1", You coward. A little misfortune and you're giving up.
8853,JAIME,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1", Misfor- misfortune?
8854,BRIENNE,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1", You lost your hand.
8855,JAIME,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1", My sword hand. I was that hand.
8856,BRIENNE,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1", You have a taste- one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit. You sound like a bloody woman.
8857,BRIENNE,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1", I know what you did for me. You told them Tarth was full of sapphires. It's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water. You knew that. Why did you help me?
8858,TYWIN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", You wanted to speak to me?
8859,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1"," Yes, about Jaime."
8860,TYWIN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", What about him?
8861,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back.
8862,TYWIN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1"," When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner, what did I do in response?"
8863,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", You started a war.
8864,TYWIN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1"," And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?"
8865,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", Whatever you can.
8866,TYWIN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", Whatever I can.
8867,TYWIN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", You're still here.
8868,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", Yes.
8869,TYWIN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", Why?
8870,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1"," Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me. Years and years of lectures on family and legacy- the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations- did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them? Living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children?"
8871,TYWIN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", All right. Contribute.
8872,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", The Tyrells are a problem.
8873,TYWIN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1"," The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon. The Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives."
8874,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", Margaery has her claws in Joffrey. She knows how to manipulate him.
8875,TYWIN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him. I don't distrust you because you're a woman. I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are. You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.
8876,CERSEI,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.
8877,TYWIN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1", I will.
8878,MAID,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3," Do you like it, Nana?"
8879,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3," Another golden rose. How original. I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses. I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear. 'Growing strong.' Ha! The dullest words of any house. 'Winter is coming!' Now that's memorable. 'We do not sow.' Strong. Strong. Those are houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts. But a golden rose growing strong- ha, that strikes fear in the heart."
8880,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3," Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along now. Grow strong."
8881,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3, My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence.
8882,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3," The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?"
8883,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3," A little obvious, perhaps."
8884,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3," Oh, no, please. Seduce away. It's been so long. Though I rather think it's all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers. But you've come mincing all this way for something. So?"
8885,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3, Might I sit?
8886,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3," No. Come, I've heard you're such a clever man. I'm curious why you've sought me out."
8887,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3, You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.
8888,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3, Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn't I take an interest? She's an interesting girl.
8889,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3, Is she?
8890,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3," No, not particularly. But she's had an interesting childhood."
8891,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3," She has, sadly. Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then. I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being."
8892,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3," Come, come. You surrender rather easily. Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too."
8893,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1, I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still.
8894,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1, Which is Sansa Stark?
8895,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1, Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father.
8896,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1," Yes. Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?"
8897,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1, I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter.
8898,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1, How?
8899,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1, You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.
8900,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1, That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.
8901,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1, Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.
8902,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1, It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.
8903,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1," Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him."
8904,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1, And why have you come to me with this matter?
8905,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1," Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army?"
8906,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1, (laughs)
8907,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1," Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North."
8908,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1," And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket."
8909,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1, Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?
8910,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1, You must despise him. You're working so hard to undermine him.
8911,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1," Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes."
8912,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1," You are a clever man, Lord Varys."
8913,VARYS,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1, You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution.
8914,OLENNA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1," One doesn't need to be clever for that. It's all rather obvious, isn't it?"
8915,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, Ahem. I didn't mean to disturb you.
8916,SANSA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, You haven't.
8917,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1," (to the guards) We'd like some privacy, please. If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep. Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names, I'll ask the king to speak with you himself."
8918,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, What did you pray for?
8919,SANSA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, I can't tell you.
8920,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1," Why not? I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning. Let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter. Boring and traditional, I'm afraid. And you?"
8921,SANSA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1," I'm sorry, I just can't."
8922,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1," My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me. Pig-face, she called me."
8923,SANSA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, Pig-face? That's ridiculous.
8924,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1," I think it had something to do with my nose. Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink."
8925,SANSA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, (laughs)
8926,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1," So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease. A week after that, she came down with porridge plague."
8927,SANSA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, Porridge plague?
8928,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, You don't have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony.
8929,SANSA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, But that's awful.
8930,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1," (nods, laughs)"
8931,SANSA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, You're- I believed you! Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.
8932,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1," Don't say that. No, you're not."
8933,SANSA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, So what happened to Alanna?
8934,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1," Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. It's all terribly frustrating."
8935,SANSA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, I'm sure she's jealous of you now. You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.
8936,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1," I want us to be friends, good friends."
8937,SANSA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, That would make me very happy.
8938,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, You must see Highgarden. You'd love it there. I know you would. We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon. You should see the costumes. People work on them for months.
8939,SANSA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, I- I don't think the queen would let me leave King's Landing.
8940,MARGAERY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1," The Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen. And if you were to marry Loras... Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it? We would be sisters, you and I. Would you like that?"
8941,SANSA,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1, (nods)
8942,JEOR,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5"," His name was Bannen. He was a good man, a good ranger. He came to us from- where did he come from?"
8943,DOLOROUS EDD,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5", Down White Harbor way.
8944,JEOR,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5"," He came to us from White Harbor. Never failed in his duty. He kept his vows the best he could. He rode far, fought fiercely. We shall never see his like again."
8945,ALL,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5", And now his watch has ended.
8946,JEOR,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5", And now his watch has ended.
8947,GRENN,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5", Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.
8948,RAST,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5", It wasn't his foot that killed him. That bastard Craster starved him to death.
8949,SAM,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5", Craster's got his daughters to feed.
8950,RAST,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5", You on his side?
8951,SAM,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5"," We can't just show up and steal all his food. We're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves."
8952,RAST,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5"," The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow. He's a bloody wildling is all he is."
8953,EDDISON,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5", Never knew Bannen could smell so good.
8954,CRASTER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1"," You have one son, don't you, Mormont? I had my ninety-ninth. You ever meet a man with ninety-nine sons?"
8955,JEOR,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", (shakes his head)
8956,CRASTER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", And more daughters than I can count.
8957,JEOR,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", I'm glad for you.
8958,CRASTER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1"," Are you now? Me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone."
8959,JEOR,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", As soon as our wounded are strong enough.
8960,CRASTER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1"," Ah. They're as strong as they're gonna get. Them that's dying, why don't you cut their throats and be done with it? Hmm? Or leave them if you've not the stomach and I'll sort them myself."
8961,KARL TANNER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1"," Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?"
8962,JEOR,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", Wait outside.
8963,KARL TANNER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", It's cold outside and there's nothing to eat.
8964,CRASTER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", My wives gave you bread.
8965,KARL TANNER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", There's sawdust in the bread.
8966,CRASTER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1"," You don't like it, you go out there and eat the snow."
8967,KARL TANNER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.
8968,JEOR,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", I told you to wait outside.
8969,RAST,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1"," He's sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die."
8970,CRASTER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", I gave you crows enough. I've got to feed my women!
8971,RAST,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1"," So you admit you've got a hidden larder, then? How else'd you make it through winter?"
8972,JEOR,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", Enough! Out!
8973,CRASTER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", I am a godly man.
8974,RAST,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", You're a stingy bastard!
8975,CRASTER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1"," Bastard? Out with you, you little thief. And you! And you! Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies. I'll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard."
8976,KARL TANNER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1"," You are a bastard. A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard."
8977,JEOR,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", The gods will curse us for this. By all the laws-
8978,KARL TANNER,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", There are no laws beyond the Wall. Now show us where he hides the food or you'll get the same as he did.
8979,JEOR,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1", Unhand her.
8980,JEOR,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1",  I shall have your head for this.
8981,SAM,3,24,and now his watch is ended,GILLY'S QUARTERS_1, Quickly. Quickly.
8982,GILLY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,GILLY'S QUARTERS_1, What's happening? I'm not going out there.
8983,SAM,3,24,and now his watch is ended,GILLY'S QUARTERS_1," No, we have to go. Now!"
8984,GILLY,3,24,and now his watch is ended,GILLY'S QUARTERS_1, Follow me. I know the best way. Come on.

9139,LOCKE,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHAL_7, Send it to his father?
9140,ROOSE BOLTON,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHAL_7, You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
9141,ROOSE BOLTON,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHAL_7," Cut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now."
9142,BRIENNE,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHAL_7," Thank you, my lord."
9143,ROOSE BOLTON,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHAL_7, Find suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later.
9144,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHAL_7, Lord Bolton.
9145,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHAL_7, Is there word from the capital?
9146,ROOSE BOLTON,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHAL_7, You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.
9147,ROOSE BOLTON,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHAL_7, Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.
9148,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1", Will I die?
9149,QYBURN,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1", No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
9150,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1", Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?
9151,QYBURN,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1"," The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow."
9152,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1", I don't need my right hand to kill you.
9153,QYBURN,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1", I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine.
9154,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1", Mmm.
9155,QYBURN,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1"," With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy."
9156,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1", No milk of the poppy.
9157,QYBURN,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1", There will be pain.
9158,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1", I'll scream.
9159,QYBURN,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1", Quite a bit of pain.
9160,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1", I'll scream loudly.
9161,CERSEI,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21, Lord Baelish.
9162,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21, Your Grace.
9163,CERSEI,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21, I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
9164,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21," Of course, Your Grace."
9165,CERSEI,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21, I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
9166,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21, I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
9167,CERSEI,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21, My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
9168,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21," Myself, I often find them a hindrance."
9169,CERSEI,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21," And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital."
9170,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21, I shall do my best.
9171,CERSEI,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21, Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
9172,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21, I assure you that it will.
9173,OLENNA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9"," Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern."
9174,PODRICK,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9"," Pardon, my lady."
9175,OLENNA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?
9176,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9"," Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters."
9177,OLENNA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
9178,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
9179,OLENNA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", Naturally.
9180,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
9181,OLENNA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
9182,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", I understand that.
9183,OLENNA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", Good.
9184,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9"," But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense."
9185,OLENNA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", And?
9186,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9"," And we're at war, Lady Olenna."
9187,OLENNA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9"," Oh, I'd nearly forgotten."
9188,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9"," Yes, and maintaining supply lines-"
9189,OLENNA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9"," I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them."
9190,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
9191,OLENNA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9"," As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?"
9192,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", I would.
9193,OLENNA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
9194,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", (nods)
9195,OLENNA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9"," I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?"
9196,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", My lady-
9197,OLENNA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9"," Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?"
9198,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", Quite sufficient. Thank you.
9199,OLENNA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9"," Very good, then. That's settled. Good day."
9200,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9", Give me that.
9201,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", What are you doing?
9202,GENDRY,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Just mending Lord Beric's armor.
9203,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Why?
9204,GENDRY,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.
9205,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1"," Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet."
9206,GENDRY,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
9207,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", You don't have to do this.
9208,GENDRY,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", I want to. They need good men.
9209,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1"," Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you-"
9210,GENDRY,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1"," What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving."
9211,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
9212,GENDRY,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1"," He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family."
9213,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", I can be your family.
9214,GENDRY,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", You wouldn't be my family. You'd be 'my lady'.
9215,MARTYN,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_3, Willem. Willem!
9216,WILLEM,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_3, Is this a rescue?
9217,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_3, Lannister filth! Take him!
9218,MARTYN,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_3," Please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire. Please-"
9219,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, Bring them in.
9220,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
9221,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5," Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance."
9222,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-
9223,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.
9224,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, They were boys! Look at them.
9225,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.
9226,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
9227,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5," It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?"
9228,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, Leave him.
9229,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
9230,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
9231,MAN,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5," Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards."
9232,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.
9233,MAN,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5," Please! Please, no. They made me do it! They made me! They made me!"
9234,EDMURE,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, Word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews. The Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it.
9235,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
9236,EDMURE,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, It wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
9237,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5," I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die."
9238,CATELYN,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.
9239,TALISA,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5," Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you."
9240,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.
9241,TALISA,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, And more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it.
9242,CATELYN,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5, Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.
9243,EDMURE,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5," A hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed."
9244,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN YARDS, LATER_1"," The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin- Stark and Karstark."
9245,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN YARDS, LATER_1", That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now.
9246,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN YARDS, LATER_1", I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.
9247,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN YARDS, LATER_1"," Kneel, my lord."
9248,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN YARDS, LATER_1"," Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?"
9249,RICKARD KARSTARK,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN YARDS, LATER_1", Kill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine.
9250,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?
9251,THOROS,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.
9252,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
9253,THOROS,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Don't think of it that way.
9254,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", But it is that way.
9255,THOROS,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", It is. And it isn't.
9256,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", More is than isn't.
9257,THOROS,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1"," Beric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether."
9258,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", So why don't you?
9259,THOROS,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", We need the gold.
9260,BERIC,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1"," Do I frighten you, child?"
9261,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", No.
9262,BERIC,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", You're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged.
9263,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", I thought he killed you.
9264,BERIC,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", He did.
9265,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", But how?
9266,BERIC,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Thoros how many times have you brought me back?
9267,THOROS,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
9268,BERIC,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", How many times?
9269,THOROS,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1"," Five, I think. No, this makes six."
9270,BERIC,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Six.
9271,THOROS,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", There was the first time- the Mountain. Show her. Lance right through the chest.
9272,BERIC,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Then I was stabbed in the belly.
9273,THOROS,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Then it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side.
9274,BERIC,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
9275,THOROS,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.
9276,THOROS,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", And the Hound makes six.
9277,BERIC,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.
9278,THOROS,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1"," You'd think you'd learn. It's not getting any easier, you know."
9279,BERIC,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1"," I know. Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away."
9280,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.
9281,THOROS,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1"," I don't think it works that way, child."
9282,BERIC,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1"," He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere. I would never wish my life upon him."
9283,ARYA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", I would. You're alive.
9284,SELYSE,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7," Lord, cast your light upon me. Protect me in the darkness. Burn away my sins. Help me serve you. Use me as you will. For the night is dark and full of terrors."
9285,SELYSE,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.
9286,STANNIS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, My lady.
9287,STANNIS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, I meant to come sooner. The battle-
9288,SELYSE,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7," I know of your troubles, My king. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything."
9289,STANNIS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7," Yes, of course."
9290,SELYSE,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, You mustn't despair. Your claim is true. You will be victorious.
9291,STANNIS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, I believed that once.
9292,SELYSE,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, You are the one god's champion and the finest man I've ever known.
9293,STANNIS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.
9294,SELYSE,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, No.
9295,STANNIS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, I've wronged you. I have shamed you.
9296,SELYSE,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, You're doing god's work.
9297,STANNIS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, You don't understand. The Red Woman- the Lady Melisandre-
9298,SELYSE,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7," I know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy."

9300,STANNIS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, That's not true.
9301,SELYSE,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, So you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions.
9302,STANNIS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, She's my daughter. I want to see her.
9303,SELYSE,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7, You are a king. You don't need my permission.

9307,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1, Father!
9308,STANNIS,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1, You've grown since I last saw you.
9309,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1, Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?
9310,STANNIS,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1, No.
9311,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1, Did the Onion Knight come back with you?
9312,STANNIS,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1, He did. He fought bravely.
9313,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1, He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.
9314,STANNIS,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1," He won't be visiting, child."
9315,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1, Why not? He's my friend. Look.
9316,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1, He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.
9317,STANNIS,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1, Ser Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him.
9318,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.
9319,BRIENNE,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, What are you doing here?
9320,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.
9321,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, Now get out.
9322,BRIENNE,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, There's another tub.
9323,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1," This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub."
9324,BRIENNE,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, Why should I care how you die?
9325,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1," You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him."
9326,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-
9327,BRIENNE,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, Don't you mock me.
9328,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.
9329,BRIENNE,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, You need trust to have a truce.
9330,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, I trust you.
9331,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?
9332,BRIENNE,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, Of course.
9333,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1," The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?"
9334,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1," First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."
9335,BRIENNE,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
9336,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
9337,BRIENNE,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, Help! Help! The Kingslayer!
9338,JAIME,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1, Jaime. My name is Jaime.
9339,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.
9340,DAVOS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1," Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?"
9341,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1," Shh, you'll wake Bert."
9342,DAVOS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, Bert?
9343,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
9344,DAVOS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew-
9345,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, he said you Were a traitor. Are you?
9346,DAVOS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1," I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price."
9347,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.
9348,DAVOS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, Aye. So they did.
9349,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more.
9350,DAVOS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1," Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me."
9351,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, Take it. I have more.
9352,DAVOS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1," My lady, I can't read the words."
9353,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, You can't?
9354,DAVOS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, (shakes his head)
9355,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.
9356,DAVOS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, No. No. No.
9357,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, It's easy. It'll be fun.
9358,DAVOS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, Go. We can't.
9359,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1," Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?"
9360,DAVOS,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1, (laughs) I wouldn't know where to start.
9361,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1," At the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is 'An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.'"
9362,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1", It was a bitch of a siege.
9363,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1"," Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?"
9364,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1"," The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his."
9365,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1", Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle?
9366,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1"," Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss."
9367,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1", (laughs)
9368,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1", In full plate metal for sixteen hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
9369,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1"," Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings."
9370,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1", You swore an oath.
9371,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1"," Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?"
9372,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1", With all my heart.
9373,DAENERYS,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD_1", These are the ones?
9374,MISSANDEI,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD_1"," Yes, khaleesi. The officers."
9375,DAENERYS,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD_1", (speaks Valyrian) You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?

9377,GREY WORM,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD_1", (speaks Valyrian) This one has the honor.
9378,DAENERYS,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD_1", (speaks Valyrian) What is your name?
9379,GREY WORM,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD_1", (speaks Valyrian) Grey Worm.
9380,DAENERYS,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD_1", (speaks Valyrian) Grey Worm.
9381,MISSANDEI,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD_1"," All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut- Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat. Names that remind them what they are- vermin."
9382,DAENERYS,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD_1"," (speaks Valeryan) From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride."
9383,GREY WORM,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD_1"," (speaks Valeryan) ""Grey Worm"" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free."
9384,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3", King Robert wanted her dead.
9385,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3", Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.
9386,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3", I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
9387,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3", I didn't sit on the small council.
9388,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3", No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-
9389,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3"," Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion."
9390,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3", He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.
9391,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3"," Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over."
9392,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3", Mm-hmm.
9393,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3"," Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms."
9394,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3"," She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience."
9395,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3", Which men do you have in mind?
9396,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3"," Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years."
9397,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3", It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
9398,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3", I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
9399,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3"," Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man."
9400,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3", We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?
9401,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3", You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.
9402,BARRISTAN,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3"," If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride."
9403,JORAH,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3", You're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.
9404,TALISA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1", Come to bed.
9405,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1", You were right.
9406,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1", The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.
9407,TALISA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1", Don't let him.
9408,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1", What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
9409,TALISA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1", We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.
9410,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1"," Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children."
9411,TALISA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1", Give them a new purpose.
9412,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1", What?
9413,TALISA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1"," Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is."
9414,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1", Here. And we're here. King's Landing-
9415,TALISA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1", What is it?
9416,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1"," I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not."
9417,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1", And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.
9418,TALISA,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1", Can you do it?
9419,ROBB,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM_1", I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry- Walder Frey.
9420,SANSA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1", He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might
9421,MARGAERY,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1", I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly.
9422,SANSA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1", Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.
9423,MARGAERY,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1", And only one to let you go. Because it will please me.
9424,LORAS,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1", Squire!
9425,OLYVAR,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1"," Well fought, ser."
9426,LORAS,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1", That was no fight. I don't know you.
9427,OLYVAR,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1"," Olyver, if it please you."
9428,OLYVAR,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1"," I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser."
9429,LORAS,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1", (chuckles)
9430,LORAS,3,25,kissed by fire,LORAS's chambers_1, How did you know?
9431,OLYVAR,3,25,kissed by fire,LORAS's chambers_1, Know what?
9432,LORAS,3,25,kissed by fire,LORAS's chambers_1, That I wanted to.
9433,LORAS,3,25,kissed by fire,LORAS's chambers_1," My lord, I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion."
9434,OLYVAR,3,25,kissed by fire,LORAS's chambers_1," They rarely do, in my experience."
9435,LORAS,3,25,kissed by fire,LORAS's chambers_1," You have a good deal of experience, do you?"
9436,OLYVAR,3,25,kissed by fire,LORAS's chambers_1, With the husbands.
9437,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, That didn't take long.
9438,OLYVAR,3,25,kissed by fire,LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1," Well, it took long enough. It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed."
9439,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,LITTLEFINGER'S CHAMBERS_1, Is he? And who's the lucky girl?
9440,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1"," She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?"
9441,SANSA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1", What is?
9442,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1"," It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different."
9443,SANSA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1", Is it?
9444,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1", Lady Margaery wears it that way.
9445,SANSA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1", Many ladies wear it this way.
9446,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1", I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.
9447,SANSA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1", You still want me to come with you?
9448,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1"," It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?"
9449,SANSA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1"," Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare."
9450,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1"," I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend."
9451,SANSA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1"," I do, Lord Baelish."
9452,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1", Petyr.
9453,SANSA,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1", Petyr.
9454,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1"," If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay."
9455,LITTLEFINGER,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK_1", We'll speak again when I return.
9456,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, You're late.

9458,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," Our business concerns her, too. Sit."
9459,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding."
9460,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.
9461,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.
9462,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, (to Cersei) Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.
9463,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
9464,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do."
9465,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, Your jokes are not appreciated.
9466,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," It wasn't my best, but-"
9467,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me."
9468,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
9469,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
9470,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
9471,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
9472,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, And how do we do that?
9473,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
9474,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, Wonderful.
9475,CERSEI,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," (amused) Yes, it is."
9476,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, You can't mean it.
9477,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, I can and I do.
9478,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.
9479,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours."
9480,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, She's a child!
9481,CERSEI,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length."
9482,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that."
9483,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, And if I refuse?
9484,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.
9485,TYRION,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, I was wed. Or don't you remember?
9486,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, Only too well.
9487,CERSEI,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.
9488,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.
9489,CERSEI,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, What do you mean?
9490,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, You'll marry Ser Loras.
9491,CERSEI,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, I will not.
9492,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach."
9493,CERSEI,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," No, I won't do it."
9494,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed."
9495,CERSEI,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare."
9496,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.
9497,CERSEI,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," Father, don't make me do it again, please."
9498,TYWIN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1, Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
9499,SHIREEN,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1," (singing)  It's always summer / Under the sea / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The rain is dry / and snow falls up / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The stones crack open / The water burns / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to play / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to stay.Embed"
9500,GILLY,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59, You've got too much wood in there.
9501,SAM,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59," But the more wood, the bigger the fire."
9502,GILLY,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59, It needs to breathe. Take off that big log.
9503,SAM,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59, Huh. You know your fires.
9504,GILLY,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59, Someone built your fires for you growing up?
9505,SAM,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59," It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course."
9506,GILLY,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59, I knew you were highborn.
9507,SAM,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59," Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think."
9508,GILLY,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59, What does it do?
9509,SAM,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59," I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?"
9510,GILLY,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59, How much longer?
9511,SAM,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59, Not so far. A few more days.
9512,GILLY,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59, Is the Wall as big as they say?
9513,SAM,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59, Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.
9514,GILLY,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59, You're playing with me.
9515,SAM,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59," I'm not. It's seven hundred feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best."
9516,GILLY,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59, Do you sing?
9517,SAM,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59," No. No, no, no. Not very well."
9518,GILLY,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59, Sing me a song.
9519,SAM,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59," Oh, all right. Let's see."
9520,SAM,3,26,the climb,Unnamed Scene_59," Oh ahem. (sings) The father's face is stern and strong / He sits and judges right from wrong / He weighs our lives, the short and long / And loves the little children / The mother gives the gift of life / And watches over every wife / Her gentle smile ends all strife  /And she loves her little children."
9521,OSHA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", That's not how you skin a rabbit.
9522,MEERA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", I know how to skin a rabbit.
9523,OSHA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", Not by the looks of it.
9524,OSHA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1"," You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game."
9525,MEERA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", I didn't see any game before I got here.
9526,OSHA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1"," If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits."
9527,MEERA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1"," Well, I made this bow myself. Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall."
9528,OSHA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1"," You learn how to use your fists, though."
9529,MEERA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1"," Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?"
9530,OSHA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", I had someone else in mind.
9531,MEERA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1"," Well, someone else is sitting right here."
9532,BRAN,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", You're both very good at skinning rabbits.
9533,OSHA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", Some of us are just a little better.
9534,MEERA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1"," Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them. Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?"
9535,OSHA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1"," You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth."
9536,BRAN,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", Stop it!
9537,HODOR,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", Hodor.
9538,BRAN,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", You've been fighting since you met. Just stop it.
9539,OSHA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1"," Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground."
9540,BRAN,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", You've been nasty to her every day. Of course she's nasty back.
9541,OSHA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1"," Me? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat."
9542,BRAN,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1"," First time I met you, you held a knife at me. We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall. I want you both to make peace."
9543,MEERA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.
9544,OSHA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1"," I said so, didn't I?"
9545,BRAN,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", Osha!
9546,OSHA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", You're a good little hunter.
9547,MEERA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1"," Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you."
9548,OSHA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", Don't push me.
9549,MEERA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", Shh. I'm right here with you.
9550,RICKON,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", What's happening?
9551,MEERA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", I'm right here with you.
9552,RICKON,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", What's wrong with him?
9553,MEERA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", The visions take their toll.
9554,BRAN,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", He's having one now?
9555,MEERA,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", (nods)
9556,JOJEN,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", I saw Jon Snow.
9557,BRAN,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", You saw him? At Castle Black?
9558,JOJEN,3,26,the climb,"THE NORTH, MORNING_1", He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies.
9559,TORMUND,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall. Crows would come out every morning with axes.
9560,ORELL,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, (to Jon) Your flock gets smaller every year.
9561,JON,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, You ever climbed it before?
9562,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, No. But Tormund's done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.
9563,JON,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, Aren't you?
9564,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19," Aye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down."
9565,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19," I brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good."
9566,JON,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, You kill someone for them?
9567,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19," Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised."
9568,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.
9569,JON,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, Can we not talk about that here?
9570,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19," 'Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls.'"
9571,JON,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, Did I seem scared the other day?
9572,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, You were trembling like a leaf.
9573,JON,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, Only in the beginning.
9574,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19," Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me."
9575,JON,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, What secret?
9576,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.
9577,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19," But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down."
9578,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.
9579,JON,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, I won't.
9580,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19, 'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.
9581,TORMUND,3,26,the climb,NORTH OF THE WALL_19," Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step. And if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers."
9582,ARYA,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne.
9583,ANGUY,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", You're good. You're not as good as you think you are.
9584,ARYA,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1"," Face, tits, balls- I hit 'em right where I wanted to."
9585,ANGUY,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1"," Aye, but you took your sweet time of it. You won't be fighting straw men, little lady. Show me your position."
9586,ANGUY,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", Keep your elbow high. You want your back doing the hard labor. You're holding. Never hold.
9587,ARYA,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", What?
9588,ANGUY,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold.
9589,ARYA,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", But I have to aim.
9590,ANGUY,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", Never aim.
9591,ARYA,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", Never aim?
9592,ANGUY,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go. Trust your eye.
9593,ARYA,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", There's someone out there.
9594,ANGUY,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", That's about far enough.
9595,MELISANDRE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", We come as friends.
9596,ANGUY,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1"," Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that."
9597,MELISANDRE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", Valar morghulis.
9598,THOROS,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", Valar dohaeris. (speaks Valyrian) I don't see many priestesses of R'hollor in the Riverlands.
9599,MELISANDRE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", (speaks Valyrian) You are Thoros of Myr.
9600,THOROS,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", (nods)
9601,MELISANDRE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", (speaks Valyrian) The High Priest gave you a mission. Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light. What happened?
9602,THOROS,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1", (speaks Valyrian) I failed.
9603,MELISANDRE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1"," (speaks Valyrian) You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk."
9604,THOROS,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1"," (speaks Valyrian) You worship Him in your way, and I'll worship Him in mine. Do you speak the common tongue?"
9605,THOROS,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_1"," My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady?"
9606,BERIC,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days.
9607,THOROS,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Lucky for the ladies.
9608,MELISANDRE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", How many times has the Lord brought him back?
9609,THOROS,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", Six.
9610,MELISANDRE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", (speaks Valerian) That's not possible.
9611,THOROS,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", (speaks Valerian) The Lord has smiled upon me.
9612,MELISANDRE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", (speaks Valerian) You should not have this power.
9613,THOROS,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1"," (speaks Valerian) I have no power. I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will."
9614,THOROS,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1"," I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him."
9615,MELISANDRE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", You've been to the other side.
9616,BERIC,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1"," The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason."
9617,MELISANDRE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1", You have someone He needs.
9618,ANGUY,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", Bodkin point. Penetrates plate at two hundred yards. Can you make 'em?
9619,GENDRY,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3"," Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel."
9620,ANGUY,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", I'll get you the steel.
9621,MAN,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", Come on.
9622,ARYA,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", I don't like that woman.
9623,ANGUY,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", That's 'cause you're a girl.
9624,GENDRY,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", (laughs)
9625,ARYA,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", What does that have to do with anything?
9626,BERIC,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3"," Forgive me, lad."
9627,ARYA,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", What are you doing? Let go of him.
9628,ARYA,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
9629,BERIC,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy.
9630,ARYA,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
9631,ARYA,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
9632,THOROS,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3"," We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold."
9633,GENDRY,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.
9634,MELISANDRE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.
9635,ARYA,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3", You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.
9636,MELISANDRE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3"," I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again."
9637,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_1," You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?"
9638,TORMUND,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_1, Look out!
9639,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_1, You all right?
9640,TORMUND,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_1," Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad."
9641,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Sorry. Were you sleeping?
9642,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Wa-
9643,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Wa-? Wa-? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.
9644,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", (whimpering)
9645,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?
9646,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Please.
9647,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Please is not a body part.
9648,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1"," I'll tell you everything, please."
9649,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1"," But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you."
9650,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1"," Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that."
9651,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", (groans)
9652,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1"," You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger."
9653,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1"," If I win, you'll let me go?"
9654,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1"," If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."
9655,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Please.
9656,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?
9657,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", The North.
9658,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Too vague.
9659,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Deepwood Motte.
9660,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Terrible guess.
9661,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1"," Now, where?"
9662,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Last Hearth.
9663,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
9664,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Karhold!
9665,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
9666,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", No. It was just a guess.
9667,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1"," Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?"
9668,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Torrhen Karstark.
9669,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.
9670,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
9671,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", You swore to tell me if I-
9672,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", You're right.
9673,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.
9674,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Yes. You win.
9675,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1"," Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar."
9676,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", (screams louder than before)
9677,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", I'm afraid I am.
9678,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", Everything I told you is a lie.
9679,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", (screams in desperation)
9680,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1"," This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason- I enjoy it."
9681,THEON,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1"," Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!"
9682,RAMSAY,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1", I win.
9683,ROBB,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.
9684,BLACK WALDER,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1"," The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come."
9685,LOTHAR,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
9686,ROBB,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.
9687,BLACK WALDER,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1"," As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands."
9688,EDMURE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", I don't think that's-
9689,ROBB,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
9690,BLACK WALDER,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", And there's something else.
9691,ROBB,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
9692,BLACK WALDER,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1"," Not what, whom."
9693,EDMURE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", What?
9694,EDMURE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", (chuckles) No.
9695,LOTHAR,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters- Roslin.
9696,EDMURE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", How old is she?
9697,LOTHAR,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", Nineteen.
9698,EDMURE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", Could I see her first?
9699,BLACK WALDER,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
9700,BRYNDEN,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?
9701,LOTHAR,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
9702,BLACK WALDER,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
9703,ROBB,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
9704,EDMURE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1"," Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord."
9705,ROBB,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
9706,EDMURE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", I didn't wound him. My answer is no.
9707,BRYNDEN,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-
9708,EDMURE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.
9709,BRYNDEN,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
9710,ROBB,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1"," It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead."
9711,EDMURE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1"," He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing."
9712,CATELYN,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
9713,ROBB,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
9714,BRYNDEN,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", You recall that heroic engagement?
9715,EDMURE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", I had something less permanent in mind.
9716,ROBB,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1"," I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost."
9717,EDMURE,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1", I'll marry her.
9718,ROBB,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1"," You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it."
9719,ROOSE BOLTON,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1", I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
9720,BRIENNE,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1"," Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing."
9721,ROOSE BOLTON,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1"," When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason."
9722,ROOSE BOLTON,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1", I should send you back to Robb Stark.
9723,JAIME,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1"," You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?"
9724,ROOSE BOLTON,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1", Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.
9725,JAIME,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1", We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
9726,ROOSE BOLTON,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1", You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
9727,JAIME,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1"," It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it."
9728,ROOSE BOLTON,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1", King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.
9729,JAIME,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1", He'll make time for you.
9730,ROOSE BOLTON,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1"," As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming."
9731,JAIME,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1", Shall we drink on it?
9732,ROOSE BOLTON,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1", I don't partake.
9733,JAIME,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1", You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
9734,JAIME,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1"," Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident."
9735,ROOSE BOLTON,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1"," Oh, she won't be going with you."
9736,BRIENNE,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1", I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-
9737,ROOSE BOLTON,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1", You are charged with abetting treason.
9738,JAIME,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1", I'm afraid I must insist.
9739,ROOSE BOLTON,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1", You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
9740,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", Impossible.
9741,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", Why?
9742,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-
9743,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3"," Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king."
9744,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", Old.
9745,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", Old?
9746,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3"," Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely."
9747,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3"," The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?"
9748,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3"," Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through."
9749,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
9750,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3"," Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?"
9751,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", Of course.
9752,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", And you never-
9753,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", No.
9754,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", Not once? Not in any way?
9755,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", Never.
9756,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3"," I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets."
9757,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
9758,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3"," I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out."
9759,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
9760,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3"," Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation."
9761,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
9762,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3"," As an authority on myself, I must disagree."
9763,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3"," Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt."
9764,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3"," And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take."
9765,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
9766,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3"," If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children."
9767,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", Oh
9768,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
9769,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
9770,TYWIN,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3"," I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?"
9771,OLENNA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3", It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.
9772,ORELL,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_3, No!
9773,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_3, (screams)
9774,TORMUND,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_3, (grunts)
9775,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_3, (screams)
9776,JON,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_3, (screams)
9777,TORMUND,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_3, (grunts)
9778,ORELL,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_3, We've gotta cut them loose!
9779,TORMUND,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_3, No!
9780,JON,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_3, (grunts)
9781,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_3, (screams)
9782,JON,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_3, (grunts)
9783,YGRITTE,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_3, (screams)
9784,JON,3,26,the climb,THE WALL_3, Take my hand!
9785,SANSA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3", That's a wonderful pin.
9786,LORAS,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3"," Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so"
9787,SANSA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",  I'm very happy about
9788,LORAS,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3"," Uh, yes. I-I am as well."
9789,SANSA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3", I feel like I'm in a dream.
9790,LORAS,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3"," Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?"
9791,SANSA,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3", No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
9792,LORAS,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3"," It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is."
9793,TYRION,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1, I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
9794,CERSEI,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1, We can have them both killed.
9795,TYRION,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1, It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
9796,CERSEI,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1, Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
9797,TYRION,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1, On a boat you built.
9798,CERSEI,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1, The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
9799,TYRION,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1, I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
9800,CERSEI,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1," I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate."
9801,TYRION,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1, Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
9802,TYRION,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1," The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot."
9803,CERSEI,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1, What do you want me to say?
9804,TYRION,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1, I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
9805,CERSEI,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1, Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
9806,TYRION,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1, Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
9807,CERSEI,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1," Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands."
9808,TYRION,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1," You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels."
9809,CERSEI,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1," When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere."
9810,TYRION,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1," Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
9811,CERSEI,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1, Who's going to tell her?
9812,SANSA,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3, Do you think people will like it?
9813,SHAE,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3, I don't think they will even notice it.
9814,SANSA,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3," You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade."
9815,SHAE,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3, I'm sure he does.
9816,SANSA,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3, Will they let me invite my family?
9817,SHAE,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3, They haven't asked my opinion.
9818,SANSA,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3, But do you think they will?
9819,SHAE,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3, No.
9820,MAID,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3," Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. Should I-"
9821,TYRION,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3," I beg your pardon, my lady."
9822,SANSA,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3," Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding."
9823,TYRION,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3," Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
9824,SANSA,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3, Of course.
9825,TYRION,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3," Alone, if I may."
9826,SHAE,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3, Why do you need to speak to her alone?
9827,SANSA,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3," Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
9828,TYRION,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3, Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
9829,SANSA,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3," It's all right, really."
9830,TYRION,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3, How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.
9831,VARYS,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3," A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread."
9832,LITTLEFINGER,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3, There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.
9833,VARYS,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3," Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice."
9834,LITTLEFINGER,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3," Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want."
9835,VARYS,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3," Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?"
9836,LITTLEFINGER,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3," You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience."
9837,VARYS,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3, I did what I did for the good of the realm.
9838,LITTLEFINGER,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3, The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
9839,VARYS,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3, But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
9840,LITTLEFINGER,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3, Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
9841,LITTLEFINGER,3,26,the climb,JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1, (voice over) Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
9842,LITTLEFINGER,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_5"," (voice over) And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is."
9843,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60, How far are we?
9844,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60," About a week, I think."
9845,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60, You think? You don't know?
9846,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60," When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad."
9847,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60, You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
9848,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60,"  Most of the time, yes."
9849,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60, How do the men holding the banners fight?
9850,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60," They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil."
9851,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60," And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?"
9852,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60, Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
9853,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60, So what good are they?
9854,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60, They help the men march.
9855,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60, How?
9856,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60," Well, it's- it's the rhythm."
9857,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60," Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming."
9858,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60," No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."
9859,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60," You know nothing, Jon Snow."
9860,ORELL,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60," She's right, you don't."
9861,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60, I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
9862,ORELL,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60," Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are."
9863,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60, And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
9864,ORELL,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_60," People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her."
9865,BRYNDEN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", That rain will cost us another day.
9866,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.
9867,CATELYN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
9868,BRYNDEN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Prickly?  That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.
9869,CATELYN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," Yes, and that is why-"
9870,BRYNDEN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen."
9871,TALISA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet shits."
9872,BRYNDEN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", (laughs)
9873,CATELYN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
9874,EDMURE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", He can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted.
9875,CATELYN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",  He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.
9876,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.
9877,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1"," If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again."
9878,TALISA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Attack. Attack.
9879,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Who are you writing?
9880,TALISA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", My mother.
9881,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Is that Valyrian?
9882,TALISA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Gaaa.
9883,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Gaaa? (sighs) Say hello for me.
9884,TALISA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Rytsas.
9885,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", 'Ritsas.'
9886,TALISA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", That was close enough.
9887,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Does she know her daughter's a queen?
9888,TALISA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Not yet.
9889,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1"," That will be a surprise, I expect."
9890,TALISA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Many surprises for her.
9891,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?
9892,TALISA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?
9893,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", I will.
9894,TALISA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", I promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild.
9895,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1"," What, now? Are you certain?"
9896,TALISA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1",  Are you angry with me?
9897,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1",  Angry? You're my queen.
9898,TALISA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", And I have your little prince or princess inside me.
9899,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Maybe one of each.
9900,TALISA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Don't get greedy.
9901,TALISA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", Can you leave the war for one night?
9902,ROBB,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1", I love you. Do you hear me? I love you.
9903,TORMUND,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, DAY_1", Most men fuck like dogs.
9904,TORMUND,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, DAY_1"," No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig. (laughs) Come on! Hey, come on."
9905,ORELL,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_1"," You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?"
9906,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_1","  No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks."
9907,ORELL,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_1"," I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls."
9908,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_1"," What, you're jealous?"
9909,ORELL,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_1",  Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own.
9910,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_1", And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.
9911,ORELL,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_1", You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him?
9912,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_1", (nods)
9913,ORELL,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_1",  'Cause he's pretty?  Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
9914,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_1", Don't touch me.
9915,ORELL,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_1", You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.
9916,SANSA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7"," Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns."
9917,MARGAERY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7", Come on. Come walk with me.
9918,MARGAERY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7"," I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother."
9919,MARGAERY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7", You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
9920,SANSA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7", How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
9921,MARGAERY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7", Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
9922,SANSA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7", No.
9923,MARGAERY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7", Has he been kind to you?
9924,SANSA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7", He's tried.
9925,MARGAERY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7"," You don't want him, though."
9926,SANSA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7", He's a Lannister.
9927,MARGAERY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7"," Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?"
9928,SANSA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7",  I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.
9929,MARGAERY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7"," My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?"
9930,SANSA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7",  My son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-
9931,MARGAERY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7", If it's the pain you're worried about-
9932,SANSA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7", I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
9933,MARGAERY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7"," What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar."
9934,SANSA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7", He's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.
9935,MARGAERY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7"," Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced."
9936,SANSA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7", And that's a good thing?
9937,MARGAERY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7","  It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice."
9938,SANSA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7", How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
9939,MARGAERY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_7"," Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me."
9940,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11", She's a child.
9941,BRONN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11", She's a foot taller than you.
9942,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11", A tall child.
9943,BRONN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11", What's the youngest you've ever had?
9944,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11", Not that young.
9945,BRONN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11", How much older?
9946,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11", Older.
9947,BRONN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11"," You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem."
9948,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11", Shae isn't going to like it.
9949,BRONN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11", Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
9950,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11", I should never have told you about that.
9951,BRONN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11"," You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own."
9952,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11", Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
9953,BRONN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11"," You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. (chuckles) You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it."
9954,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11", I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.
9955,BRONN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_11", You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.
9956,TYWIN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", Your Grace.
9957,JOFFREY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", Grandfather.
9958,TYWIN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", You wanted to speak to me?
9959,JOFFREY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.
9960,TYWIN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1"," You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them."
9961,JOFFREY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.
9962,TYWIN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", Of course.
9963,JOFFREY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.
9964,TYWIN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1"," I have, yes."
9965,JOFFREY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", May I ask why?
9966,TYWIN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1"," The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively."
9967,JOFFREY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1"," So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?"
9968,TYWIN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",  We could arrange to have you carried.
9969,JOFFREY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
9970,TYWIN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", Where did you hear about this?
9971,JOFFREY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", Is it true?
9972,TYWIN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", Apparently so.
9973,JOFFREY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", Don't you think we ought to do something about it?
9974,TYWIN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1"," When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple."
9975,JOFFREY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
9976,TYWIN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1"," Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us."
9977,JOFFREY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
9978,TYWIN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
9979,JOFFREY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", But I haven't been counseled.
9980,TYWIN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", You are being counseled at this very moment.
9981,JOFFREY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1", I should be consulted about such things.
9982,TYWIN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1"," From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace."
9983,JORAH,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1", Yunkai. The Yellow City.
9984,BARRISTAN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1"," The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them."
9985,JORAH,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1"," On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man."
9986,DAENERYS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1", I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
9987,JORAH,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1"," We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne."
9988,DAENERYS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1", How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
9989,JORAH,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1", Two hundred thousand if not more.
9990,DAENERYS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1", Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city.
9991,DAENERYS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1"," (speaks Valyrian) Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor."
9992,MISSANDEI,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1," Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace."
9993,MISSANDEI,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1," Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons."
9994,DAENERYS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, You may approach. Sit.
9995,MISSANDEI,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, Will the noble lord take refreshment?
9996,RADZAL MO ERAZ,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, (nods)
9997,RADZAL MO ERAZ,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1," Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi."
9998,DAENERYS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
9999,RADZAL MO ERAZ,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1," If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people."
10000,RADZAL MO ERAZ,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.
10001,RADZAL MO ERAZ,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
10002,DAENERYS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, My ship?
10003,RADZAL MO ERAZ,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1," Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require."
10004,DAENERYS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, And what do you ask in return?
10005,RADZAL MO ERAZ,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1,  All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
10006,DAENERYS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, I have a gift for you as well. Your life.
10007,RADZAL MO ERAZ,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, My life?
10008,DAENERYS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1," And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
10009,RADZAL MO ERAZ,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1," You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well."
10010,RADZAL MO ERAZ,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, You swore me safe conduct.
10011,DAENERYS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1," I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother."
10012,RADZAL MO ERAZ,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, Take the gold.
10013,DAENERYS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1," My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out."
10014,RADZAL MO ERAZ,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, (speaks Valerian)
10015,BARRISTAN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.
10016,DAENERYS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?
10017,JORAH,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, I don't know.
10018,DAENERYS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1, Find out.
10019,SHAE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", Chains?
10020,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.
10021,SHAE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", Golden chains.
10022,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", You could buy a ship with these.
10023,SHAE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", Do I need a ship?
10024,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", What?
10025,SHAE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", Am I going somewhere?
10026,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", Of course you're not going anywhere.
10027,SHAE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5"," So, am I invited to your wedding?"
10028,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
10029,SHAE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.
10030,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5"," That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire."
10031,SHAE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
10032,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5",  I don't have a choice. My father-
10033,SHAE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
10034,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
10035,SHAE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", And I'm Shae the funny whore.
10036,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
10037,SHAE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?
10038,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", I swear to you it will not be like that.
10039,SHAE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", No? What will it be like?
10040,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5"," I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for."
10041,SHAE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?
10042,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5","  Listen. Listen to me, my lady."
10043,SHAE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", I'm not your lady.
10044,TYRION,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5", You are. You'll always be my lady.
10045,SHAE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_5"," I'm your whore. And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing."
10046,GENDRY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1, What happened?
10047,MELISANDRE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1, Wildfire. I should have been here.
10048,GENDRY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1," After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started."
10049,MELISANDRE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1, Do you miss it?
10050,GENDRY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1, King's Landing?
10051,MELISANDRE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1, Your father's house.
10052,GENDRY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1, Never had a father. Never wanted one.
10053,MELISANDRE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1, Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?
10054,GENDRY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1, I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.
10055,MELISANDRE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1," Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up."
10056,GENDRY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1, I was born in Flea Bottom.
10057,MELISANDRE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1, Your blood is noble.
10058,GENDRY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1," Are you saying my father, he was some lord or-"
10059,MELISANDRE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1, There. Your father's house.
10060,GENDRY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1, I'm just a bastard.
10061,MELISANDRE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,BLACKWATER BAY_1," The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood."
10062,BERIC,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3"," Come sit by the fire, child."
10063,THOROS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3"," Not talking, eh? That's a first."
10064,ARYA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", I don't talk to traitors.
10065,BERIC,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", I didn't like giving up the boy.
10066,ARYA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up.
10067,BERIC,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3"," The Red God is the one true god. You've seen his power. When he commands, we obey."
10068,ARYA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", He's not my one true god.
10069,BERIC,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", No? Who's yours?
10070,ARYA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", Death.
10071,ANGUY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", Spotted a Lannister raiding party.
10072,BERIC,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", How many?
10073,ANGUY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", No more than twenty.
10074,BERIC,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", How far?

10077,THOROS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3"," What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?"
10078,MEN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", Yeah!
10079,ARYA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.
10080,THOROS,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", It will still be west of here two days from now.
10081,ARYA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", You swore.
10082,BERIC,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3"," To take you home, and I will. But we need to do this first."
10083,ARYA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3", Why? So you can steal their gold?
10084,BERIC,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3"," I swear to you, this isn't-"
10085,ARYA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3"," I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all."
10086,BERIC,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3"," One day you'll understand, but now-"
10087,BERIC,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3"," Anguy, bring her back."
10088,MAN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_3"," Come back, girl!"
10089,THE HOUND,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS, NIGHT_1"," Kick all you like, wolf girl. Won't do you no good."

10092,BRIENNE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"HARRENHALL, NIGHT_1", Have they told you what they plan to do with me?
10093,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"HARRENHALL, NIGHT_1",  Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding. You're to remain here.
10094,BRIENNE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"HARRENHALL, NIGHT_1", With Locke?
10095,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"HARRENHALL, NIGHT_1", I owe you a debt.
10096,BRIENNE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"HARRENHALL, NIGHT_1"," When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her. Now it's your promise. You gave your word. Keep it and consider the debt paid."
10097,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"HARRENHALL, NIGHT_1", (nods) I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it.

10126,MYRANDA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3"," Well, he's been through so much. Look at his poor face."
10127,THEON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", Help me. If he comes back-
10128,VIOLET,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", We need to make him feel better.
10129,MYRANDA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", And how can we make him feel better?
10130,VIOLET,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", I have an idea.
10131,VIOLET,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3"," Oh, she's shy. You know how they are, these religious girls."
10132,MYRANDA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", Maybe he doesn't know how we are.
10133,MYRANDA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3"," Oh. I felt something. Oh, Lord Greyjoy."
10134,VIOLET,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", As good as they say?
10135,MYRANDA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", Mmm.
10136,VIOLET,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", And why should you get all the fun?
10137,MYRANDA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",  What? You like her better?
10138,VIOLET,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", Plenty there for both of us.
10139,MYRANDA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", I was here first.
10140,THEON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", (moaning)
10141,RAMSAY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Terrible timing.
10142,THEON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", (cries)
10143,RAMSAY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", But I was getting jealous.
10144,RAMSAY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?
10145,RAMSAY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back.
10146,RAMSAY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part?
10147,THEON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3"," Please. No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!"
10148,RAMSAY,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3", This is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations.
10149,THEON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3"," No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!"
10150,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS_1", You're gonna scare it off.
10151,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS_1", I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.
10152,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS_1", It's too far away.
10153,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", Is that a palace?
10154,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", It's a windmill.
10155,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", Windmill. Who built it? Some king?
10156,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", Just the men who used to live here.
10157,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3"," They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high."
10158,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", Winterfell has towers three times that size.
10159,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", 'I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.'
10160,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3"," If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell."
10161,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", What's swooning?
10162,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", Fainting.
10163,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", What's fainting?
10164,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", When a girl sees blood and collapses.
10165,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
10166,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", Well not all girls are like you.
10167,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3"," Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? (gasps) Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow."
10168,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
10169,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", I'd like to see you in a silk dress.
10170,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", Would you?
10171,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", So I could tear it off you.
10172,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3"," Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye."
10173,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
10174,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.
10175,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3"," Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that."
10176,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", You know nothing-
10177,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3"," Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed."
10178,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", And how do you know that?
10179,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3"," Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same."
10180,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", Mance is different.
10181,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
10182,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", You don't know that.
10183,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3"," I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you."
10184,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3", All of us.
10185,YGRITTE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3"," You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live."
10186,JON,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3"," Yes, first we'll live."
10187,OSHA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?
10188,HODOR,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",  Hodor.
10189,JOJEN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", That's where we are.
10190,OSHA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", What are you telling him?
10191,BRAN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1"," It's all right, Osha."
10192,OSHA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day?  Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.
10193,MEERA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", Leave him alone.
10194,OSHA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", He can speak for himself.
10195,JOJEN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", I don't fill his head with anything.
10196,OSHA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", So what do you talk about?
10197,JOJEN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",  What's happening to him and what that means.
10198,OSHA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1"," Go on, then. Tell us what it means."
10199,JOJEN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.
10200,OSHA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
10201,JOJEN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", We're not going to Castle Black.
10202,OSHA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", What did you say?
10203,JOJEN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",  I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
10204,OSHA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1"," Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me."
10205,BRAN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.
10206,OSHA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
10207,BRAN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
10208,OSHA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1"," Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone."
10209,BRAN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1", You don't understand. You don't know.
10210,OSHA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1"," You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long."
10211,OSHA,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1"," I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further."
10212,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1"," How is the pain, my lord?"
10213,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
10214,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1"," Well, we've stymied the corruption."
10215,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1"," Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man."
10216,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", All the good it's done me.
10217,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
10218,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1"," Faint praise, my lord."
10219,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
10220,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1"," No, my lord. That's not my weakness."
10221,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", What is?
10222,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
10223,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", You performed experiments on living men.
10224,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", On dying men.
10225,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", With their permission?
10226,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
10227,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1"," Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside."
10228,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1"," How many men have you killed, my lord?"
10229,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", I don't know.
10230,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", Fifty? A hundred?
10231,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", (shakes his head)
10232,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", Countless.
10233,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", Countless has a nice ring to it.
10234,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", And how many lives have you saved?
10235,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
10236,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
10237,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", A fair offer.
10238,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", A fair offer. Locke won't take it.
10239,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", Why not?
10240,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
10241,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", (sighs)
10242,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", He feels he's being cheated.
10243,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", They'd be fools to kill her.
10244,QYBURN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1"," These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much."
10245,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", We have to return to Harrenhal.
10246,"""STEELSHANKS"" WALTON",3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", Why?
10247,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",  I've left something behind.
10248,"""STEELSHANKS"" WALTON",3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton.
10249,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", And what are those orders?
10250,"""STEELSHANKS"" WALTON",3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",  To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.
10251,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", You think you'll get a reward.
10252,"""STEELSHANKS"" WALTON",3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", I serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father-
10253,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1"," You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off."
10254,"""STEELSHANKS"" WALTON",3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", I had nothing-
10255,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1", Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.
10256,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, Whoa.
10257,"""STEELSHANKS"" WALTON",3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1," Eyes open, lads."
10258,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, Be quiet.
10259,MEN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1," (singing) The bear, the bear and the maiden fair / From there to here, from here to there / All black and brown and covered in hair / He smelled that girl in the summer air / The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!"
10260,MAN,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, Don't spare her. Don't spare her!
10261,LOCKE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1," Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight."
10262,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, A wooden sword?
10263,LOCKE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, I thought you'd gone.
10264,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, You gave her a wooden sword.
10265,LOCKE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, We've only got one bear.
10266,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1," I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there."
10267,LOCKE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
10268,LOCKE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.
10269,BRIENNE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, Ah!
10270,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, Get behind me.
10271,BRIENNE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, I will not.
10272,LOCKE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
10273,"""STEELSHANKS"" WALTON",3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.
10274,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, Pull her up.
10275,BRIENNE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, Hold my legs.
10276,BRIENNE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, Pull him up!
10277,LOCKE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, The bitch stays.
10278,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
10279,LOCKE,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.
10280,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1, What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton?  Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
10281,JAIME,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1," Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires."
10282,THE HOUND,3,28,second sons,Unnamed Scene_61," I'll give you one try, girl."
10283,THE HOUND,3,28,second sons,Unnamed Scene_61," Kill me and you're free. But if I live, I'll break both your hands. Go on, hit me. Hit me hard."
10284,THE HOUND,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1"," Sulk all you want. The truth is, you're lucky. You don't want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you."
10285,ARYA,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1", There's no one worse than you.
10286,THE HOUND,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1"," Ha, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them."
10287,ARYA,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1", You're lying.
10288,THE HOUND,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1"," Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open."
10289,ARYA,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1", Is that the Blackwater?
10290,THE HOUND,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1", The Blackwater?  Where do you think I'm taking you?
10291,ARYA,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1", Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
10292,THE HOUND,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1", Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.
10293,ARYA,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1", But why?
10294,THE HOUND,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1",  Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
10295,ARYA,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1", Why would they be at the Twins?
10296,THE HOUND,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1",  Those outlaws you love so much never told you?  The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
10297,BARRISTAN,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5, Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.
10298,JORAH,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5, They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
10299,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5, You know these men?
10300,JORAH,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5," Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, ""The Titan's Bastard."""
10301,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5, Is he more titan or bastard?
10302,JORAH,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5," He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are."
10303,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5, How many?
10304,BARRISTAN,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5," Two thousand, Your Grace. Armored and mounted."
10305,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5, Enough to make a difference?
10306,BARRISTAN,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5, (nods)
10307,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5, It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
10308,JORAH,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5, I imagine you're right.
10309,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5, I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
10310,JORAH,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5, He may not agree to meet.
10311,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5, He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
10312,BARRISTAN,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1," Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and-"
10313,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, Daario Naharis
10314,MERO,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, You are the Mother of Dragons?  I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
10315,JORAH,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, Mind your tongue.
10316,MERO,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
10317,MERO,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1," (laughs) You, slave girl, bring wine."
10318,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, We have no slaves here.
10319,MERO,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.
10320,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1," Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?"
10321,BARRISTAN,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1," Under two thousand, Your Grace."
10322,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1," We have more, don't we?"
10323,BARRISTAN,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, Ten thousand Unsullied.
10324,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1," I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us."
10325,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have eight thousand Unsullied.
10326,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, You're very young to be a captain.
10327,PRENDAHL,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.
10328,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1," Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side."
10329,MERO,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
10330,JORAH,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
10331,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, Or you could fight for me.
10332,MERO,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.
10333,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, I would pay you as much and more.
10334,PRENDAHL,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1," Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again."
10335,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
10336,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.
10337,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1," A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide."
10338,MERO,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.
10339,GREY WORM,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1," (speaks Valyrian) My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?"
10340,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, (speaks Valyrian) These men are our guests. (Speaks common.) You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
10341,MERO,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
10342,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1," A barrel, then."
10343,MERO,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1," Good. The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we'll all share you."
10344,MERO,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1, I'll come looking for you when this is over.
10345,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1," Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first."
10346,BARRISTAN,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1," Gladly, Your Grace."
10347,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1"," Half Robert, half lowborn."
10348,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1", Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon.
10349,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1", What do you mean to do with him?
10350,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1", You know what I mean to do with him.
10351,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1"," Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?  If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy."
10352,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1"," Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?"
10353,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1", No.
10354,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1"," If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor."
10355,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1", You've slaughtered many lambs?
10356,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1", And none have seen the blade.
10357,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1"," 'And tho- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod- rode Vhagar- Vhag-' Fuck me. 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog- enough- enough to swallow a horse whole."
10358,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", Your Grace.
10359,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", They feeding you enough?
10360,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1"," Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain."
10361,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", You don't belong in a place like this.
10362,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1"," Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse."
10363,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", Yeah.
10364,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
10365,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", (nods)
10366,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", Melisandre's returned.
10367,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", I didn't know she'd been gone.
10368,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
10369,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", Why?
10370,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", She says there's power in king's blood.
10371,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", She's going to kill him.
10372,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", Sacrifice him.
10373,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1"," Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew."
10374,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
10375,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", Because he has your blood in his veins.
10376,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", So did Renly.
10377,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1"," Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent."
10378,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1"," How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no?  Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?"
10379,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1"," Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?"
10380,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
10381,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
10382,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1", You have little regard for your own life.
10383,DAVOS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1"," Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night."
10384,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1"," I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
10385,PRENDAHL,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.
10386,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, You talk too much.
10387,MERO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
10388,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, Eight thousand Unsullied stand between her and your cock.
10389,MERO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
10390,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
10391,MERO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1," Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores."
10392,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1," I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend."
10393,MERO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference?
10394,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, I fight for beauty.
10395,PRENDAHL,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, For beauty?
10396,MERO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, We fight for gold.
10397,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
10398,MERO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, You'll die young.
10399,PRENDAHL,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, What do we do about the dragon girl?  We can't beat eight thousand Unsullied on the battlefield.
10400,MERO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.
10401,PRENDAHL,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, She's well guarded.
10402,MERO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, Tonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
10403,PRENDAHL,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, Which one of us?
10404,MERO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1," Close your eyes, love."
10405,MERO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1," Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking."
10406,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I'm right here.
10407,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, You have something for me?
10408,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1, Valar morghulis.
10409,TYRION,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5", Lady Sansa.
10410,SANSA,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5"," You look very handsome, my lord."
10411,TYRION,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5"," Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?"
10412,TYRION,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5"," My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this."
10413,SANSA,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5"," I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord."
10414,TYRION,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5"," No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel."
10415,SANSA,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5"," I doubt that very much, my lord."
10416,TYRION,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5", You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
10417,TYRION,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5"," But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?"
10418,SANSA,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5", When I have to.
10419,TYRION,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5"," Well, today you have to."
10420,MARGAERY,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3"," You look radiant, Your Grace."
10421,CERSEI,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3", Radiant? Why radiant?
10422,MARGAERY,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3", It's the word that came to mind.
10423,MARGAERY,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3", We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.
10424,CERSEI,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3"," You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice."
10425,MARGAERY,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3"," A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid."
10426,CERSEI,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3"," Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?"
10427,MARGAERY,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3", Of course. They play it so often here at court.
10428,CERSEI,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3", So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
10429,MARGAERY,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3","  Not as well as you, I'm sure."
10430,CERSEI,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3", House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
10431,MARGAERY,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3", (nods)
10432,CERSEI,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3"," Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"
10433,MARGAERY,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3", Gone.
10434,CERSEI,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3"," Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword."
10435,CERSEI,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3"," I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'"
10436,CERSEI,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3"," If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep."
10437,SANSA,3,28,second sons,INSIDE THE SEPT_1, What are you doing?
10438,JOFFREY,3,28,second sons,INSIDE THE SEPT_1," Your father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband."
10439,HIGH SEPTON,3,28,second sons,INSIDE THE SEPT_1, You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
10440,TYRION,3,28,second sons,INSIDE THE SEPT_1, Could you-
10441,TYRION,3,28,second sons,INSIDE THE SEPT_1, Thank you.
10442,HIGH SEPTON,3,28,second sons,INSIDE THE SEPT_1," Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever."
10443,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", Have you ever seen one like it?
10444,GENDRY,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.
10445,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1"," It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it."
10446,GENDRY,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.
10447,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1"," Here, taste this."
10448,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", You think I'm trying to poison you?
10449,GENDRY,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", That's good.
10450,GENDRY,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", That's really good.
10451,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", Where do you think it's from?
10452,GENDRY,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", I couldn't even guess.
10453,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1"," Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take."
10454,GENDRY,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1"," That thought had crossed my mind, yeah."
10455,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", There are no mistakes. Not for us.
10456,GENDRY,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
10457,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1"," Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us."
10458,GENDRY,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", I don't understand. This- this doesn't seem very religious.
10459,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1"," According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see."
10460,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1"," Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I."
10461,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me.
10462,GENDRY,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", What are you doing?
10463,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", You have to trust me.
10464,GENDRY,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", What-?  Get it away. Get it off me.
10465,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1"," Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much."
10466,GENDRY,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", Why are you doing this?
10467,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
10468,GENDRY,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1"," No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!"
10469,MELISANDRE,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.
10470,GENDRY,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1"," Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord!"
10471,GENDRY,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", (cries out)
10472,STANNIS,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1", The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
10473,OLENNA,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1"," So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew?  Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute."
10474,TYRION,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1", (snorts)
10475,SANSA,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1"," Will you pardon me, my lord?"
10476,TYRION,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1", Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.
10477,CERSEI,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1", Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
10478,JOFFREY,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1", I've got a lifetime for that.
10479,CERSEI,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1", Stay.
10480,TYWIN,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1", You seem rather drunk.
10481,TYRION,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1", Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
10482,TYWIN,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1"," This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."
10483,TYRION,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1", And?
10484,TYWIN,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1"," If you're going to give her one, you need to perform."
10485,TYRION,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1", What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.
10486,TYWIN,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1", More than once.
10487,TYRION,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1"," There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit."
10488,TYWIN,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1"," You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty."
10489,LORAS,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1"," Well, my father once told me-"
10490,CERSEI,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1", Nobody cares what your father once told you.
10491,JOFFREY,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1," Congratulations, my lady."
10492,SANSA,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1," Thank you, Your Grace."
10493,JOFFREY,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1," Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?  What a glorious day."
10494,SANSA,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1," Yes, Your Grace."
10495,JOFFREY,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1, I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that?
10496,JOFFREY,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1, You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
10497,JOFFREY,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1, Time for the bedding ceremony.
10498,TYRION,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1, There will be no bedding ceremony.
10499,JOFFREY,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1," Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy."
10500,TYRION,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1, There will be no bedding ceremony.
10501,JOFFREY,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1, There will be if I command it.
10502,TYRION,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1, Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
10503,JOFFREY,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1, What did you say? What did you say?
10504,TYWIN,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1," I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king."
10505,TYRION,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1," A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there."
10506,TYWIN,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1," Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace."
10507,TYRION,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1, I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.
10508,TYRION,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1," My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife."
10509,TYRION,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1," I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree?  Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood."
10510,SANSA,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1," Is that wise, my lord?"
10511,TYRION,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1," Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion."
10512,SANSA,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1," Is that wise, Tyrion?"
10513,TYRION,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1, Nothing was ever wiser.
10514,TYRION,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1, Astoundingly long.
10515,SANSA,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1, What?
10516,TYRION,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1, Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
10517,SANSA,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1, Fourteen.
10518,TYRION,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1," Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage."
10519,TYRION,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1," Stop. I can't. I could, I won't."
10520,SANSA,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1, But your father-
10521,TYRION,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1," If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to."
10522,SANSA,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1, What if I never want you to?
10523,TYRION,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1, And so my watch begins.
10524,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, Ninteen
10525,MISSANDEI,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1," Yes, Your Grace."
10526,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, How can anyone speak nineteen languages?
10527,MISSANDEI,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
10528,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1," Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?"
10529,MISSANDEI,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.
10530,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, (in Dothraki) Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.
10531,MISSANDEI,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, Athjahakar.
10532,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, Athjahaka.
10533,MISSANDEI,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, Ath-ja-hakar.
10534,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, Athjahakar.
10535,MISSANDEI,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, (nods)
10536,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1," Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice."
10537,MISSANDEI,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1," Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry."
10538,MISSANDEI,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, (gasps)
10539,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, No screaming or she dies.
10540,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, What do you want?
10541,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, You.
10542,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, Let her go.
10543,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1," Don't scream, lovely girl."
10544,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, You were sent here to kill me?
10545,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, (nods and chuckles)
10546,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, So why haven't you?
10547,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, I don't want to.
10548,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, What do your captains have to say about that?
10549,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, You should ask them.
10550,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, Why?
10551,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, We had philosophical differences.
10552,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, Over what?
10553,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
10554,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, You're a strange man.
10555,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
10556,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, And this is supposed to impress me?
10557,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, Yes.
10558,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
10559,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
10560,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, Will you fight for me?
10561,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, (nods)
10562,DAENERYS,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1, Swear to me.
10563,DAARIO,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1," The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours."
10564,TYRION,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, MORNING_1", You really ought to knock.
10565,SHAE,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, MORNING_1", I brought your breakfast.
10566,BABY,3,28,second sons,"NORTH OF THE WALL, DUSK_1", (fusses)
10567,SAM,3,28,second sons,"NORTH OF THE WALL, DUSK_1", It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
10568,BABY,3,28,second sons,"NORTH OF THE WALL, DUSK_1", (fusses)
10569,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", How hard can it be to build a fire?
10570,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.
10571,BABY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", (fusses)
10572,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", He winked at me before.
10573,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", I doubt it.
10574,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", I saw him wink at me.
10575,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", He blinked.
10576,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
10577,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", A what?
10578,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1"," Well, I mean, there's no real difference."
10579,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", A wink is on purpose.
10580,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
10581,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
10582,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", What? No. This is just the way I talk.
10583,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", I'll build that fire.
10584,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", Don't you think he should have a name?
10585,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", I don't know many boys' names.
10586,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1"," Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jo,n Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer."
10587,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", Craster.
10588,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1"," Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-"
10589,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", Mormont.
10590,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1"," That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name."
10591,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", Why is it a last name?
10592,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1"," Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly."
10593,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1"," His name is Samwell Tarly, too?"
10594,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1"," No, Randyll Tarly."
10595,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", Randyll is a handsome name.
10596,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", Please don't name him Randyll.
10597,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", Is your father cruel like mine?
10598,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", Different manner of cruel.
10599,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1"," Not Randyll, then."
10600,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", Don't. Don't go out there.
10601,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", I'll be back. I just want to look.
10602,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-
10603,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", It's come for the baby.
10604,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", Stay back!
10605,SAM,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", You stay back!
10606,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1","  No, you can't have him! No!"
10607,GILLY,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1", No!
10608,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_62, Are you sure about this?
10609,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_62, No.
10610,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_62, It's dangerous.
10611,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_62," If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible.  Take his home, take his gold, take his power."
10612,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_62, Why are you telling me?
10613,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_62, You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
10614,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_62, Now Winterfell is burned to the ground.  The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.
10615,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_62," So, Casterly Rock?  I'm asking your advice."
10616,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_62, We have enough men?
10617,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_62, If Walder Frey cooperates.
10618,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_62, If Walder Frey cooperates.
10619,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_62," If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea."
10620,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_62, We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.
10621,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_62, Show them how it feels to lose what they love.
10622,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table.  I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven."
10623,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," We thank you for your hospitality, my lord."
10624,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness."
10625,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," Don't beg my forgiveness, your Grace.  It wasn't me you spurned, it was my girls."
10626,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," One of them was supposed to be queen, now none of them are."
10627,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," This is Arwyn, my daughter.  My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra."
10628,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63, My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.
10629,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins.  You could have had either.  Could have had both for all I care."
10630,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63, My granddaughter Marianne.  My granddaughter Freya.  My granddaughter...W-W-Wertha? Waldra? Waldina?
10631,MERRY,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63, I'm Merry.
10632,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," Fine.  And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet.  Clearly you don't have the patience for all that."
10633,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," My ladies.  All men should keep their word, kings most of all.  I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.  The fault is not with you.  Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.  I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another.  I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house.  I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends."
10634,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63, Very good.
10635,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," There she is.  Come closer, let me have a look at you."
10636,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63, Still can't see you.  Old eyes.
10637,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," Love.  That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?  Heh. Very honorable, I call it a pretty face.  Mmmm, very pretty.  Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.  Very shapely as well.  Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.  If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place."
10638,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," I can always see what's going on beneath a dress.  Been at this a long time.  I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is.  Doesn't drop an inch."
10639,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63, Your king says he betrayed me for love.  I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.
10640,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," And I can respect that.  When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought.  Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot.  We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men."
10641,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," Thank you, my lord."
10642,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_63," Well, let's get ready.  The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us."
10643,DAENERYS,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65, Where?
10644,DAARIO,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65, There.
10645,DAARIO,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65," There, it's a back gate.  My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves."
10646,JORAH,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65, Your men but not you?
10647,DAARIO,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65, I have no interest in slaves.  A man cannot make love to property.
10648,DAARIO,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65," This is where we enter the city.  Very few guards, they know me.  They let me inside."
10649,BARRISTAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65, We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.
10650,DAARIO,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65," I kill the guards.  I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates."
10651,DAARIO,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65," Then comes the army.  Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours."
10652,JORAH,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65," Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army.  The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners."
10653,DAARIO,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65," You have a very suspicious mind.  In my experience, only dishonest people think this way."
10654,JORAH,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65, You command the Unsullied.  What do you think?
10655,DAENERYS,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65," [Speaking to Grey Worm in Valyrian] Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa."
10656,GREY WORM,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65, [In Valyrian] I trust him.
10657,DAENERYS,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65," [Speaking in the Common Tongue (in this case, English) again] You leave tonight."
10658,JORAH,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65, Very good.  We'll prepare.
10659,BARRISTAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65, Ser Jorah.  You can use an extra sword.
10660,JORAH,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_65," You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan.  Your place is by the Queen.  If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done.  No matter the cost, no matter our pride."
10661,SAMWELL,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_66," We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us.  It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.  Too big, impossible to maintain.  Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.  It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.  No one's used it for centuries, most likely.  It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do."
10662,GILLY,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_66, How do you know all that?
10663,SAMWELL,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_66, I read about it in a very old book.
10664,GILLY,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_66, You know all that from staring at marks on paper?
10665,SAMWELL,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_66, Yes.
10666,GILLY,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_66, You're like a wizard.
10667,GILLY,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_66, Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived.  Here we are.  Alive.
10668,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, Remember what happens to children who run.  I'm your father and I'll do the talking.
10669,PIG FARMER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67," The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning."
10670,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, Need a hand?
10671,PIG FARMER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, Need about eight hands.
10672,PIG FARMER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding.
10673,PIG FARMER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, Many thanks.
10674,ARYA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, Don't! Don't kill him.
10675,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, Dead rats don't squeak.
10676,ARYA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67," You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people.  A real hard man you are."
10677,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, More than anyone you know.
10678,ARYA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, You're wrong.  I know a killer. A real killer.
10679,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, That so?
10680,ARYA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, You'd be like a kitten to him.  He'd kill you with his little finger.
10681,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, That him?
10682,ARYA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, No.
10683,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, Good.
10684,ARYA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, Don't kill him!  Please.  Please don't.
10685,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_67, You're very kind.  Someday it'll get you killed.
10686,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_68, Where are we?
10687,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_68," The Gift, I think.  Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night’s Watch for their sustenance and support.  Maester Luwin taught me that."
10688,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_68, Doesn’t seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.
10689,MEERA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_68, It’s good land and there’s no war up here.  Why leave?
10690,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_68, Wildlings.
10691,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_68," Sorry.  But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women."
10692,RICKON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_68, Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.
10693,RICKON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_68, That’s what Old Nan said.
10694,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_68, There’s a storm coming.
10695,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_68, I don’t see any.
10696,MEERA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_68, It’s as good a place to shelter as any.
10697,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_68, We can drink some blood while we wait.  I don’t need much.
10698,ORELL,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69, Only one old man and eight good horses.
10699,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69, What’s one old man doing with eight horses?
10700,JON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69, He breeds them for the Watch.
10701,YGRITTE,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69, How’s he keep folks from stealing them?
10702,JON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69, The Watch protects him.
10703,ORELL,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69," Not today they don’t.  He’s selling horses, he’s got some gold in there."
10704,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69, And proper steel.
10705,ORELL,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69, Let’s carve him up.
10706,JON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69, We just take the horses and go.  The old man’s no threat.
10707,ORELL,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69, I keep telling you.
10708,YGRITTE,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69, He’s an old man.  A spear through the heart’s a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
10709,JON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69, The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.  They’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
10710,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69," I hope so.  Killing crows in their castle is tough.  Killing them out here in the open, that’s what we do."
10711,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69, Spread out.  Surround the hut and move in.
10712,JON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69, Ygritte!
10713,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_69, Clear the barn!
10714,ARYA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_70,  No one’s going to believe you’re a hog farmer if you eat them all.
10715,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_70, Best part of the animal.
10716,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_70," Don’t worry, they’re still there."
10717,ARYA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_70, I know they’re still there.
10718,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_70, You check every five minutes like you’re afraid they’re gonna move.
10719,ARYA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_70, I’m not afraid.
10720,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_70," Of course you are.  You’re almost there and you’re afraid you won’t make it.  The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.  No point in trying to hide behind that face.  I know fear when I see it.  Seen it a lot."
10721,ARYA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_70, I knew fear when I saw it in you.  You’re afraid of fire.
10722,ARYA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_70," When Beric’s sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl."
10723,ARYA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_70," And I know why, too.  I heard what your brother did to you.  Pressed your face to the fire like you’re a nice juicy mutton chop."
10724,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_70, That give you some ideas?
10725,ARYA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_70, Might do.
10726,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_70, Go ahead then.  You might get away.  Might even make it there on your own.  They’re just over the river.  The closest you’ve been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy’s neck.
10727,ARYA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_70, Someday I’m gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
10728,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, How are we going to get past the Wall?  My uncle said it’s 700 feet high.
10729,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, How did you get past it?
10730,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
10731,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
10732,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Some climb straight up the ice.
10733,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Even Hodor’s not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.
10734,HODOR,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Hodor!
10735,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Nineteen castles guard the Wall.  Only three are still manned.
10736,HODOR,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Hodor!
10737,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.
10738,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.
10739,MEERA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71," Well, we’ll have to open them up again."
10740,OLD MAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71," [From outside] Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
10741,MEERA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, There’s a rider out there.
10742,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Just one?
10743,MEERA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, There’s more.
10744,HODOR,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Hodor!
10745,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71," It’s just thunder, sweet giant."
10746,HODOR,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Hodor.
10747,OLD MAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, [From outside]  I yield.  I yield.
10748,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Wildlings.
10749,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, [To BRAN and RICKON]  Where’s Shaggydog and Summer?
10750,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Hunting.
10751,HODOR,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Hodor!
10752,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71," Shhh, quiet, Hodor."
10753,HODOR,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Hodor!
10754,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, [To BRAN] Make him shut up.  If they hear us…
10755,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71," [To Hodor] Hush, Hodor.  No, no more Hodoring."
10756,HODOR,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Hodor!
10757,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71," Hodor, calm down."
10758,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, You need to keep quiet.
10759,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, They’re gonna hear us.
10760,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71," Hodor, be quiet."
10761,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71," Hodor, calm down.  Hodor, be quiet!"
10762,MEERA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, [To BRAN] What did you do?
10763,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, Nothing.  I don’t know.
10764,RICKON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, What’s That?
10765,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_71, That’s a horse dying.
10766,WILDLING 1,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72, Bring them over here.
10767,WILDLING 2,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72, That was the last of them.  The rest are dead.
10768,ORELL,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72, [To TORMUND] I heard shouting up there.
10769,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72, Thunder.
10770,ORELL,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72, I know the difference between shouting and thunder.
10771,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72, Maybe it's ghosts.
10772,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72," That won’t help you, grandpa."
10773,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72, Where you riding?
10774,OLD MAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72," Doesn’t matter now, does it?"
10775,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72," No, it doesn’t matter now."
10776,ORELL,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72, Cut his throat or he’ll tell the crows we’re here.
10777,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72, You understand.
10778,OLD MAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72, Let me stand at least.
10779,OLD MAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72, Let me go with a bit of dignity.
10780,ORELL,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_72, [Looks at JON] Make the crow kill him. [Walks towards JON]  You’re one of us now.  Prove it.
10781,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, [Looks at BRAN]  The wolves are out there.
10782,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, I can’t do it by choice.  I don’t know how.  It happens in my dreams.
10783,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73," You’re a warg, Bran.  It’s in your blood."
10784,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, I can’t.
10785,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73," You just did, with him."
10786,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, A wolf is nothing compared to that.
10787,OLD MAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, She looks sharp.
10788,YGRITTE,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, [Looks at Jon]  Do it.  Do it.
10789,ORELL,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, Told ya.  He’s still one of them.
10790,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73," Go on, boy."
10791,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, Go on!
10792,ORELL,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, He’s a crow.  He’ll always be a crow.  And here’s his crow wife guarding him.  He’ll stab us in the back first chance he gets.
10793,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, Kill him!
10794,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, He’s one of them!
10795,YGRITTE,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, No!
10796,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, Do you hear me?
10797,TORMUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, You’re not gonna die for one of them.
10798,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, Do it.  They’ll find us if you don’t.
10799,JON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_73, You were right the whole time.
10800,DAARIO,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_74," When you hear a songbird’s whistle, you come.  I’m a great whistler, the greatest in the land."
10801,DAARIO,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_74, Daario Naharis.
10802,DAARIO,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_74, That one was quick.
10803,JORAH,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_74, There may be others.
10804,DAARIO,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_74, I doubt it.  The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.
10805,JORAH,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_74, [Addressing DAARIO] That’s what you call a few guards?
10806,ROSLIN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_75," Lord Edmure, I hope I’m not a disappointment to you."
10807,EDMURE,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_75," You’re a delight to me, my lady."
10808,SEPTON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_75, You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
10809,SEPTON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_75," In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity.  Look upon each other and say the words."
10810,EDMURE & ROSLIN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_75," Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger.  I am hers (I am his) and she is mine (he is mine) from this day until the end of my days."
10811,MEERA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, Is that safe?
10812,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, They’re long gone.
10813,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, [Looks at JOJEN] You were right.  I can get inside Summer’s mind whenever I want.
10814,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, Of course you can.  North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals.  But you did a lot more than that.  You got inside Hodor’s mind.
10815,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, They can’t do that north of the Wall?
10816,JOJEN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, No one can do that.  Anywhere.
10817,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76," [Looks at RICKON]  When I was looking through Summer’s eyes, I saw Jon."
10818,RICKON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, Where?
10819,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, He was with the wildlings.  They tried to kill him but he got away.
10820,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, He’ll be heading back to Castle Black then.  That’s where we should go.
10821,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76," For all we know, Castle Black’s already under attack.  If this many wildlings got through-"
10822,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, I already told you.  I’m not going north of the Wall.
10823,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, Everything Jojen told me is true.  You saw what I did to Hodor.  I have to find the three-eyed raven.
10824,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76," Listen to me, little lord."
10825,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76," Don’t worry, I’m not asking you to come with me.  It won’t be safe for Rickon."
10826,RICKON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, [Surprised] Me? I’m coming with you.
10827,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, No.  You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.  The Umbers are our bannermen.  They’ll protect you.
10828,RICKON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, I’m coming with you.  I’m your brother.  I have to protect you.
10829,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76," Right now, I have to protect you."
10830,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76," Robb’s at war and I’m going beyond the Wall.  If something happens to us, you’re the heir to Winterfell."
10831,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, [Looks at OSHA]  Will you know how to find the last Hearth?
10832,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, You Southerners build your big castles and you never move.  You’re easy to find.
10833,RICKON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, We’re not Southerners.
10834,RICKON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, And I don’t want to leave you.
10835,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76," Shhh.  [She grabs RICKON by the waist and sits him on her lap]  Come here, little soldier.  You and me, we’re gonna have some adventures."
10836,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, You don’t have to do any of this.
10837,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76," Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be.  [To RICKON] Shhh.  We’ll be fine, you and me.  The Umbers are great warriors.  Even I heard about them growing up.  They’ll teach you how to swing a sword."
10838,RICKON,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76," [Crying, looks at OSHA]  I know how to swing a sword."
10839,BRAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, You’re leaving now?  It’s the middle of the night.
10840,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, I learned to walk in darkness.
10841,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76," Say your good-byes, little man."
10842,OSHA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_76, [Looks at the Reeds] Keep this one safe.  [MEERA gives a slight nod]  He means the world to me.
10843,DAENERYS,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_77," We’ve been waiting a long time. [BARRISTAN looks at her]  Haven’t we?  [BARRISTAN shrugs]  Well I don’t know, you tell me.  How long does it take to sack a city?"
10844,JORAH,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_77, [Looks at DAENERYS]  It was just as you said.  They did not believe until it was too late.  Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
10845,DAENERYS,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_77, And Daario Naharis?
10846,DAARIO,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_77," The city is yours, my queen."
10847,TALISA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," [Looking at the band and talking to LOTHAR] They’re good, aren’t they?"
10848,LOTHAR,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, They ought to be because they cost enough.
10849,BLACKFISH,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, Look at the crowd there.
10850,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, [Looking at EDMURE and talking to BLACKFISH] He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him.
10851,BLACKFISH,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, The God’s love to reward a fool.
10852,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, [Laughs] Uncle.
10853,BLACKFISH,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," What? He’s my nephew, I love him.  And he’s a damned fool."
10854,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," Don’t you drink, Lord Bolton?"
10855,ROOSE,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," Never do, my lady.  Dulls the senses."
10856,BLACKFISH,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, That’s the point. [Still talking to ROOSE while the servant pours him more wine] Didn’t you marry one of these Frey girls?
10857,ROOSE,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," Aye.  Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl’s weight in silver as a dowry.  So I have a fat, young bride."
10858,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, I hope she makes you very happy.
10859,ROOSE,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," Well, she’s made me very rich."
10860,BLACKFISH,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," Pardon, my lord, my lady.  I need to find a tree to piss on."
10861,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, My mother’s alone with Roose Bolton.  I should rescue her.
10862,TALISA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I’ve ever met.
10863,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, Be kind.  She’s finally starting to like you.
10864,TALISA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," And I like her.  But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there [Looks at EDMURE and ROSLIN], eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey’s hand."
10865,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, Perhaps I’ve made a terrible mistake.
10866,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, Striking your king is an act of treason.
10867,TALISA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," No, don’t.  Don’t insult them."
10868,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, [Addressing ROBB loudly so everybody can hear] Your Grace.
10869,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.  But they are not yet man and wife.  A sword needs a sheath [Everybody laughs]. And a wedding needs a bedding [Everybody cheers].  What does my sire say?"
10870,EVERYBODY,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," [Knocking on the tables, chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!"
10871,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," [Gets up from his seat and addresses WALDER] If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them."
10872,EVERYBODY,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, [Chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!
10873,EDMURE,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," Ho-ho!  Careful now, ladies.  Once you set that monster free, there’s no caging him again [Laughs]."
10874,EVERYBODY,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, [Chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!
10875,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, Poor girl.
10876,ROOSE,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, Every bride suffers the same.  I’m sure you endured yours with grace.
10877,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," Oh, Ned forbade it.  He said it wouldn’t be right if he broke a man’s jaw on our wedding night."
10878,TALISA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, That is a very strange custom.
10879,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner’s perspective.
10880,TALISA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, It seems normal to you?
10881,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," It’s tradition. [TALISA stares at ROBB]  Without the bedding ceremony, there’s no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage."
10882,TALISA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," No, but there are other ways of providing proof."
10883,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, Boy or girl?
10884,TALISA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," I don’t know.  But if it’s a boy, I know what we should name him."
10885,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78," Oh, do you?   It seems to me the father should have some say in his son’s naming."
10886,TALISA,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, Eddard. [Catches ROBB by surprise] Don’t you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
10887,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_78, I do.
10888,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
10889,FREY GUARD,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79, Where are you going?
10890,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79, Got salt pork for the feast.
10891,FREY GUARD,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79, The feast is over.
10892,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79, It doesn’t sound like it’s over.
10893,FREY GUARD,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79," If I tell you it’s over, it’s over.  [Angrily] Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here."
10894,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79," Got pig’s feet, too [ARYA looks up]."
10895,FREY GUARD,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79, [Infuriated] Are you soft in the head?  Turn this cart around!
10896,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79, Your Grace.
10897,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79, I feel I’ve been remiss in my duties.
10898,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79, I’ve given you meat and wine and music but I haven’t shown you the hospitality you deserve.  My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.
10899,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79, Robb!
10900,MAN 1,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79," [Laughing] You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh? [Men laughing]"
10901,MAN 2,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79," Feast over yet, is it?"
10902,FREY MAN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79," Aye, it’s over! [Slit’s the throat of a Stark soldier]"
10903,THE HOUND,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79, It’s too late.
10904,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79," The King in the North arises, heh heh."
10905,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79," Lord Walder!  Lord Walder, enough!  Let it end!  Please!  He is my son! [ROBB is still cradling TALISA on the floor]  My first son!  Let him go and I swear that we will forget this!  I swear it by the Old Gods and New!  We will take no vengeance."
10906,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79," [Angrily] You already swore me one oath right here in my castle.  You swore by all the Gods, your son would marry my daughter!"
10907,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79," Take me for a hostage but let Robb go!  Robb, get up! Get up and walk out!  Please!  Please!"
10908,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79, And why I would let him do that?
10909,CATELYN,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79," On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife’s throat!"
10910,WALDER,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79, I’ll find another.
10911,ROBB,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79, Mother.
10912,ROOSE,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_79, The Lannisters send their regards.
10913,MAN,3,30,mhysa,THE STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, It's too late.
10914,MAN #2,3,30,mhysa,THE STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, Yah! Yah!
10915,MAN,3,30,mhysa,THE STARK ENCAMPMENT_1," Go, move out!"
10916,FREY MEN,3,30,mhysa,THE STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
10917,FREY MEN,3,30,mhysa,THE STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, The King in the North! The King in the North!
10918,FREY MAN,3,30,mhysa,THE STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, Here comes the King in the North! Here comes the King in the North!
10919,FREY MEN,3,30,mhysa,THE STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, The King in the North! The King in the North!
10920,FREY MAN,3,30,mhysa,THE STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, Here comes
10921,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
10922,SANSA,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", What are you doing?
10923,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", I have a list.
10924,SANSA,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", A list of people you mean to kill?
10925,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9"," For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-"
10926,SANSA,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", You should learn to ignore them.
10927,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9"," My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp."
10928,SANSA,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
10929,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.
10930,SANSA,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", (laughs)
10931,SANSA,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", So how should we punish them?
10932,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", Who? Whom?
10933,SANSA,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
10934,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
10935,SANSA,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", I hear that you're a pervert.
10936,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
10937,SANSA,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9"," (chuckles) We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from."
10938,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", Lady Sansa!
10939,SANSA,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.
10940,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", Why sheep shift?
10941,SANSA,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", That's the vulgar word for dung.
10942,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", My lady-
10943,SANSA,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9"," Well, you asked me."
10944,GIRL,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9", Oh! That's him!
10945,PODRICK,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9"," My lord, my lady. Your father has called a meeting of the small council."
10946,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, Killed a few puppies today?
10947,JOFFREY,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," Show him. Come on, show him."
10948,PYCELLE,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," Oh, apologies, my lord. Old fingers."
10949,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, 'Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
10950,JOFFREY,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, Robb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother. (to Pycelle) Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
10951,VARYS,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage."
10952,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
10953,JOFFREY,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast."
10954,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, No. She is no longer yours to torment.
10955,JOFFREY,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster."
10956,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
10957,JOFFREY,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, I could have your tongue out for saying that.
10958,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
10959,PYCELLE,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste."
10960,JOFFREY,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, I am the king! I will punish you.
10961,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you."
10962,JOFFREY,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
10963,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, The king is tired. See him to his chambers.
10964,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, Come along.
10965,JOFFREY,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, I'm not tired.
10966,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.
10967,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep."
10968,JOFFREY,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, I'm not tired!
10969,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, Come.
10970,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, Not you.
10971,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
10972,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
10973,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
10974,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, You really think a crown gives you power?
10975,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, No. I think armies give you power.
10976,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, Mm-hmm.
10977,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same."
10978,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, Mm-hmm.
10979,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances."
10980,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
10981,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, I'm all for cheating. This is war.
10982,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
10983,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, So that's why you did it? To save lives?
10984,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
10985,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, The Northerners will never forget.
10986,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
10987,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
10988,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
10989,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
10990,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, I will not rape her.
10991,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
10992,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
10993,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
10994,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, (smirks)
10995,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, Does that amuse you?
10996,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
10997,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," Easy for me, is it?"
10998,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1, When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
10999,TYWIN,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1," The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister."
11000,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3, Sansa.
11001,MEERA,3,30,mhysa,THE NORTH_9, It's empty.
11002,JOJEN,3,30,mhysa,THE NORTH_9, Let's find a place to sleep.
11003,HODOR,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1", Hodor. Hodor.
11004,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1"," Don't, Hodor."
11005,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1", Maybe we shouldn't stay.
11006,MEERA,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1", You'd rather be out there?
11007,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1", There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
11008,JOJEN,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1", I always quite liked the horrible stories.
11009,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1", So did I. Once.
11010,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1", You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
11011,MEERA,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1", No. Who's he?
11012,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1"," Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry."
11013,MEERA,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1", If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-
11014,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1", It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.
11015,WALDER FREY,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1"," 'The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I'm Lord of Riverrun. (laughs)"
11016,ROOSE BOLTON,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", The Blackfish escaped.
11017,WALDER FREY,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
11018,ROOSE BOLTON,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", As you say.
11019,WALDER FREY,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1"," They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?"
11020,ROOSE BOLTON,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", You'll be needing a new young girl.
11021,WALDER FREY,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", Yeah. Got that to look forward to.
11022,ROOSE BOLTON,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", (grunts)
11023,WALDER FREY,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1"," And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country."
11024,ROOSE BOLTON,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant-
11025,WALDER FREY,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
11026,ROOSE BOLTON,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", (nods)
11027,WALDER FREY,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1"," Well, here's to the Young Wolf! (howls)"
11028,ROOSE BOLTON,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", Forever young.
11029,WALDER FREY,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
11030,ROOSE BOLTON,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
11031,WALDER FREY,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1"," Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing."
11032,ROOSE BOLTON,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.  Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon.
11033,WALDER FREY,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", Oh. And?
11034,ROOSE BOLTON,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1", Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
11035,RAMSAY,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5"," Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock."
11036,RAMSAY,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
11037,RAMSAY,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
11038,RAMSAY,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5"," Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?"
11039,RAMSAY,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
11040,THEON,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", (cries)
11041,RAMSAY,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", But my father taught me to aim for their head.
11042,THEON,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", Kill me.
11043,RAMSAY,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5"," Sorry, what?"
11044,THEON,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", Kill me.
11045,RAMSAY,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", A little louder.
11046,THEON,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", Kill me!
11047,RAMSAY,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", You're no good to me dead. We need you.
11048,RAMSAY,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5"," You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat."
11049,THEON,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", (groans)
11050,RAMSAY,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", Stinking meat.
11051,RAMSAY,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?
11052,THEON,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", Theon Greyjoy.
11053,RAMSAY,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", What's your name?
11054,THEON,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", Th- Theon Greyjoy.
11055,THEON,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", Please.
11056,RAMSAY,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", What is your name?!
11057,THEON,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5", Reek. My name is Reek.
11058,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Hodor.
11059,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Don't kill me!
11060,MEERA,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Who are you?
11061,GILLY,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Sam! Sam!
11062,MEERA,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Who are you?!
11063,GILLY,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Gilly. Don't hurt us.
11064,JOJEN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Where are you going?
11065,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
11066,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1"," My brother, he's in the Night's-"
11067,JOJEN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Shush.
11068,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Who's your brother?
11069,JOJEN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Doesn't matter.
11070,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
11071,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1"," No, I'm not."
11072,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.
11073,HODOR,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Hodor.
11074,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1"," I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will."
11075,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Take us north of the Wall.
11076,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", What? Why in the world would you want to go-
11077,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", I don't want to. I have to.
11078,JOJEN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", How did you get through the Wall?
11079,MEERA,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
11080,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
11081,GILLY,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", Come with us. There's nothing north but death.
11082,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1"," If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you."
11083,JOJEN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
11084,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1"," What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way."
11085,JOJEN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", You saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
11086,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", How do you know all that?
11087,JOJEN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
11088,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1", But you're going to stop them?
11089,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1"," Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to."
11090,BALON,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1," 'Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all Ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home."
11091,BALON,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1," On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the twenty Ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him.'"
11092,BALON,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1," 'Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.' Get that out of my sight."
11093,BALON,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1, Theon disobeyed my orders.
11094,BALON,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1," The boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me."
11095,YARA,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1, He's your son.
11096,BALON,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1, Son? He's not a man anymore.
11097,YARA,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1, He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.
11098,BALON,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1, Watch yourself. I've made my decision.
11099,YARA,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1, And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
11100,YARA,3,30,mhysa,YARA aboard an Ironborn ship. The crew stands at attention as she walks past_1, (voiceover) I'm going to choose the fifty best killers on the Iron Islands.
11101,MAN,3,30,mhysa,YARA aboard an Ironborn ship. The crew stands at attention as she walks past_1, Get those ropes!
11102,YARA,3,30,mhysa,YARA aboard an Ironborn ship. The crew stands at attention as she walks past_1, (voiceover) I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.
11103,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1", What is it?
11104,JOJEN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1", Dragonglass.
11105,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1", We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.
11106,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1", Why? What are they for?
11107,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1", Killing White Walkers.
11108,MEERA,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1", How do you know that?
11109,GILLY,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1", The Walker came for my baby. And Sam-
11110,MEERA,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1",  But no one's killed a White Walker in thousands of years.
11111,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1"," Well, I suppose someone had to be the first."
11112,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1"," Take it, Hodor."
11113,SAM,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1"," And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us."
11114,BRAN,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1", I wish I could. I really do.
11115,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", How are you keeping?
11116,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", Great. Never better.
11117,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", It was just a bit of blood.
11118,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3"," I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want."
11119,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", I'm not a highborn.
11120,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", She called you Ser. I heard it.
11121,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
11122,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3"," Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help."
11123,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", I lived below the Street of Flour.
11124,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
11125,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
11126,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", Gin Alley.
11127,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3"," The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king."
11128,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3"," Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me."
11129,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3"," If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?"
11130,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3"," You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?"
11131,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3"," She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that."
11132,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", So how'd you become a lord?
11133,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3"," Oh, that's a long story."
11134,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3"," Better not, then. I'm a bit busy."
11135,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.
11136,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", You see? Highborns.
11137,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
11138,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", Why did you?
11139,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
11140,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", Does he?
11141,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", He's dead.
11142,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", How'd he die?
11143,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3", Following me.
11144,VARYS,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11", When did you come to this strange country?
11145,SHAE,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11", When I was thirteen.
11146,VARYS,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11", You were only a child.
11147,SHAE,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11", I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.
11148,VARYS,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11"," You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking."
11149,SHAE,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11", And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
11150,VARYS,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11", She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
11151,SHAE,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11", I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?
11152,VARYS,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11"," No, I expect not."
11153,SHAE,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11", She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
11154,VARYS,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11"," We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-"
11155,SHAE,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11", I have a name.
11156,VARYS,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11", You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.
11157,SHAE,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11"," What do you want from me, Lord Varys?"
11158,VARYS,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11"," Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up."
11159,SHAE,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11", Why do you want me to leave?
11160,VARYS,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11"," Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time."
11161,SHAE,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11", Lord Varys.
11162,SHAE,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11"," If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself."
11163,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", Keep up.
11164,PODRICK,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1"," I don't think I can, my lord."
11165,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.
11166,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", Leave.
11167,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1"," So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend."
11168,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", She doesn't deserve this.
11169,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
11170,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
11171,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", (chuckles)
11172,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
11173,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
11174,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
11175,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
11176,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
11177,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", So she can have some happiness in her life.
11178,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", You have children. How happy would you say you are?
11179,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1"," Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive."
11180,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", Even Joffrey?
11181,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1"," Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own."
11182,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", How long does it go on?
11183,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", Until we've dealt with all our enemies.
11184,TYRION,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1"," Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more."
11185,CERSEI,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1", Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.
11186,FREY SOLDIER,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5"," I'm telling you, that's what she did. Sounded like a cow in heat."
11187,FREY SOLDIER #2,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5"," Aye, not for long."
11188,FREY SOLDIER #3,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", That's right. Black Walder shut her up right quick. None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
11189,FREY SOLDIER,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5"," I'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body."
11190,FREY SOLDIER #2,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", You sewed it on?
11191,FREY SOLDIER,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", I did.
11192,FREY SOLDIER #2,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", I bet there were a thousand men claiming they were the one.
11193,FREY SOLDIER,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5"," It was me. And Malcolm and Talbott. Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time. Took the skin right with it. What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone. Give it a nice firm mooring and-"
11194,FREY SOLDIER,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", What do you want?
11195,ARYA,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", Mind if I keep warm?
11196,FREY SOLDIER #2,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", Fuck off.
11197,ARYA,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", But I'm hungry.
11198,FREY SOLDIER,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", Does fuck off mean something different where you're from?
11199,ARYA,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", I've got money.
11200,FREY SOLDIER,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", What kind of coin is that?
11201,ARYA,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", It's worth a lot.
11202,ARYA,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", Sorry.
11203,FREY SOLDIER,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", Little shit.
11204,FREY SOLDIER #2,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", Fool!
11205,HOUND,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", Where did you get the knife?
11206,ARYA,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", From you.
11207,HOUND,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", Is that the first man you've killed?
11208,ARYA,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", The first man.
11209,HOUND,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5"," Next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first."
11210,ARYA,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5", (whispers) Valar morghulis.
11211,JON,3,30,mhysa,THE NORTH_11," Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am."
11212,YGRITTE,3,30,mhysa,THE NORTH_11, (grunts)
11213,JON,3,30,mhysa,THE NORTH_11, I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me.
11214,YGRITTE,3,30,mhysa,THE NORTH_11," You know nothing, Jon Snow."
11215,JON,3,30,mhysa,THE NORTH_11, I do know some things. I know I love you.
11216,JON,3,30,mhysa,THE NORTH_11, I know you love me. But I have to go home now.
11217,SAM,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1, I know how this must look. What I meant was-
11218,GILLY,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1," I swear to you, my lord-"
11219,MAESTER AEMON,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1," I'm not a lord, my dear. Not for many, many years. Every man who joins the Night's Watch renounces all former titles. Among other things. What is your name?"
11220,GILLY,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1, Gilly.
11221,MAESTER AEMON,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1," Ah, for the gillyflower. Lovely."
11222,GILLY,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1," Yes, my-"
11223,SAM,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1, Maester.
11224,GILLY,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1, Master.
11225,SAM,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1, Maester.
11226,MAESTER AEMON,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1, And the child?
11227,SAM,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1, She hasn't chosen a name yet.
11228,GILLY,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1, His name is Sam.
11229,MAESTER AEMON,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1, Tarly do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order?
11230,SAM,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1," He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build five hundred miles of ice walls seve hundred feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us."
11231,MAESTER AEMON,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1," Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being. We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall."
11232,GILLY,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1, Thank you Maester. I can cook and clean and I can-
11233,MAESTER AEMON,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1," Good. Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell. I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay."
11234,SAM,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1, Miles better.
11235,MAESTER AEMON,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1, We had forty-four ravens at last count. Make sure they're all fed. Every one of them flies tonight.
11236,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9, 'To His Grace King Stannis Baratheon. Invaded- inv- invit- invited to the name day celebration for Rylene Florent on the first nigit-'
11237,SHIREEN,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9, Night.
11238,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9, 'First night of the full moon.' Why is there a G in night?
11239,SHIREEN,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9, I don't know. There just is.
11240,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9," Well, your father's not going to go to that."
11241,SHIREEN,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9, My books are better than these boring scrolls. You could read about Balerion the Dread. They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. I'd like to see that someday.
11242,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9, I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.
11243,SHIREEN,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9, 'His fangs were as long as bastard swords.'
11244,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9," Aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer. But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed. The king does not have time for this drudgery. 'To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.'"
11245,SHIREEN,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9, ' Noblemen.'
11246,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9," 'Noblemen of Westeros, the Nig- the Night's Watch implores-'"
11247,SHIREEN,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9, What is it?
11248,SHIREEN,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9, Why are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked?
11249,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9, Stay here. Bar the door.
11250,STANNIS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3", The usurper Robb Stark is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman.
11251,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3", And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?
11252,MELISANDRE,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3", I take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.
11253,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3"," Your Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man."
11254,STANNIS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3"," Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?"
11255,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3", Aegon Targaryen.
11256,STANNIS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3", And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
11257,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3"," On the back of his dragon, Balerion the Dread."
11258,STANNIS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3"," He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal."
11259,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3"," You do not need to burn the boy. If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-"
11260,MELISANDRE,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3", And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne. A great gift requires a great sacrifice.
11261,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3", His name is Gendry. He's a good lad. A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew.
11262,STANNIS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3", What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?
11263,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3", Everything.
11264,STANNIS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_3", The boy must die.
11265,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON, NIGHT_1", What are you doing?
11266,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON, NIGHT_1", You're leaving.
11267,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON, NIGHT_1", Is this some kind of trick?
11268,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON, NIGHT_1"," Yes, but not on you."
11269,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1"," Aim for that star. Don't stop. There's bread and water. Go slow with it. If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink seawater."
11270,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", I know not to drink seawater.
11271,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest. You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.
11272,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", Where should I go?
11273,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.
11274,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", The gold cloaks are looking for me.
11275,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", They were looking for me for twenty years. Do they know your face?
11276,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", No.
11277,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", I'd worry more about the Red Woman.
11278,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", The other way.
11279,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", You ever been in a boat before?
11280,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", No.
11281,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", You know how to swim?
11282,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", No.
11283,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", Don't fall out. Go on.
11284,GENDRY,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", Why are you doing this?
11285,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1", Because it's right. And because I'm a slow learner.
11286,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, SHORE_1"," When you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me."
11287,GUARD,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_3, Horse approaching! Halt! Halt!
11288,SAM,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD_3," Jon! Jon! Jon, it's us."
11289,PYP,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD_3, I don't think he can see us.
11290,JON,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD_3, Pyp? Sam?
11291,SAM,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD_3," Hush, now. You're home. Carry him inside. Gently."
11292,MAN,3,30,mhysa,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_3," Out of the way. Step aside, country boy. People working here."
11293,JAIME,3,30,mhysa,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_3, Cersei.
11294,STANNIS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5", You don't deny it?
11295,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5", No. I let him go.
11296,MELISANDRE,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5", Your mercy saved the boy's life. You feel good about that?
11297,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5"," Aye, I do."
11298,MELISANDRE,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5", You saved one innocent. How many tens of thousands have you doomed?
11299,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5", There has got to be another way.
11300,STANNIS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5", What other way?! Tell us about this other way.
11301,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5"," I don't know, Your Grace. I can't see the future in the fire."
11302,STANNIS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5"," Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth. I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die."
11303,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5"," I understand. But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it. You're gonna need me."
11304,MELISANDRE,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5", Take him away.
11305,STANNIS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5", Why am I gonna need you?
11306,MELISANDRE,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5", My king.
11307,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5"," It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch. Their Lord Commander is dead. Took a ranging party north and never made it back. One lad did, though. What he saw beyond the Wall- it's coming for all of us."
11308,STANNIS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5", When did you learn to read?
11309,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5", Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.
11310,MELISANDRE,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5"," This War of Five Kings means nothing. The true war lies to the north, my king. Death marches on the Wall. Only you can stop him."
11311,DAVOS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5"," You can't stop him alone. You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side."
11312,STANNIS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5", I've made my decision.
11313,MELISANDRE,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5", He's right. You need him. He has a part to play in the war to come.
11314,STANNIS,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_5"," (chuckles) You see, Ser Davos? You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock. You're in his army now."
11315,BARRISTAN,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3," They will come, Your Grace. When they're ready."
11316,DAENERYS,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3, Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.
11317,JORAH,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3, You didn't conquer them. You liberated them.
11318,DAENERYS,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3, People learn to love their chains.
11319,MISSANDEI,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3," (speaking Valyrian) This is Daenerys Targaryen, the Stormborn, the Unburnt, the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, Mother of Dragons. It is to her you owe your freedom"
11320,DAENERYS,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3, No.
11321,DAENERYS,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3," (speaking Valyrian)  You do not owe me your freedom.  I cannot give it to you. Your freedom is not mine to give. It belongs to you and you alone. If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves. Each and every one of you."
11322,MAN,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3, Mhysa!
11323,DAUGHTER,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3, Mhysa!
11324,CROWD,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3,  Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
11325,DAENERYS,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3, What does it mean?
11326,MISSANDEI,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3," It is old Ghiscari, khaleesi. It means 'mother'."
11327,CROWD,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3, Mhysa! Mhysa!  Mhysa.
11328,DAENERYS,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3, It's all right. These people won't hurt me.
11329,DAENERYS,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3, (in Valyrian) Fly.
11330,CROWD,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3, Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa.
11331,DAENERYS,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3,  (in Valyrian) Let me pass
11332,CROWD,3,30,mhysa,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_3, Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa. Mhysa!
11333,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Magnificent.
11334,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80,  Mm-hmm.
11335,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Looks fresh-forged.
11336,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, It is.
11337,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
11338,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.
11339,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
11340,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, From someone who no longer had need of it.
11341,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.
11342,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, And now we have two.
11343,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Two?
11344,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.
11345,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," Well, thank you. It's glorious."
11346,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, You'll have to train your left hand.
11347,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.
11348,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, You'll never be as good.
11349,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter."
11350,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
11351,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.
11352,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80,  The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.
11353,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
11354,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80,  Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.
11355,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Home?
11356,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
11357,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80,You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
11358,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80,  I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
11359,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
11360,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80,  You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.
11361,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, No.
11362,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80,  No?
11363,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, No.
11364,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, I don't believe I asked you a question.
11365,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, There's my answer.
11366,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80,  If you think your bloody honor comes before...
11367,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children."
11368,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80,  What do you want?
11369,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Supper would be nice.
11370,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve."
11371,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, I suppose you want the sword back.
11372,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80,  Keep it.
11373,TYWIN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.
11374,BRONN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
11375,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Please don't.
11376,BRONN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside."
11377,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends."
11378,BRONN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?"
11379,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.
11380,BRONN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?"
11381,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
11382,BRONN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Oh.
11383,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," Ah, here we are."
11384,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Can you read the sigils?
11385,BRONN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Yellow balls?
11386,PODRICK,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood. A vulture grasping a baby in it's talons, House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave."
11387,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Boy knows his Dornish Houses.
11388,BRONN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, I need a sigil.
11389,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80,"  And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?"
11390,PODRICK,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," I don't see it, my lord."
11391,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company."
11392,DORNISH LORD,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.
11393,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," (Nods.) Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast."
11394,DORNISH LORD,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Will he?
11395,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, And where is Prince Oberyn?
11396,DORNISH LORD,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," Arrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince."
11397,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep."
11398,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, You must be weary after such a long journey.
11399,BRONN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?
11400,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80,  We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
11401,BRONN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80, How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
11402,TYRION,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?"
11403,BRONN,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_80," I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old."
11404,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", Look at this one. How lovely is she?
11405,ELLARIA,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", Beautiful. But pale.
11406,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", They like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields.
11407,WHORE #1,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1"," (Shakes her head no, looking down. )"
11408,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", You like?
11409,ELLARIA,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", Timid. Timid bores me.
11410,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1"," You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?"
11411,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1"," I think she likes you. ELLARIA"" She has good taste."
11412,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1"," You're not timid, are you?"
11413,ELLARIA,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", (Laughs) Not timid.
11414,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1",  Do you like women?
11415,WHORE #2,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1"," When they look like her, my lord."
11416,ELLARIA,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", This one will do nicely.
11417,OLYVAR,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1"," Very good, my lady."
11418,ELLARIA,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1"," Oh, I'm not a lady."
11419,OLYVAR,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", A term of courtesy in this establishment.
11420,ELLARIA,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", A lie anywhere. Why not use the right words? I'm a bastard. She is a whore. And you're what? A procurer.
11421,OLYVAR,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", Any of the others?
11422,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1",  The two girls can leave.
11423,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1",  You stay.
11424,OLYVAR,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1"," I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord."
11425,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1",  Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.
11426,OLYVAR,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1",  My lord.
11427,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1","  I am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince?"
11428,OLYVAR,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", Can't say I have. I'm wildly expensive.
11429,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1",  Take off your clothes.
11430,OLYVAR,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", Which way do you like it?
11431,OLYVAR,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", (Gasps)
11432,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", My way  .
11433,MORGAN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", And so he spoke and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere.  And now the rains
11434,ELLARIA,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1", Oberyn.
11435,MORGAN,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1",  Weep o'er his hall...
11436,ELLARIA,4,31,two swords,"INTERIOR, brothel_1","  Oberyn, don't."
11437,MORGAN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1,"   With no one there to hear Yes, not the rains  weep o'er his hall And not a soul to hear."
11438,MORGAN'S FRIEND,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," You lost, friend?"
11439,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, Forgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.
11440,MORGAN'S FRIEND,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.
11441,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, We don't like the smell. (Laughs)
11442,ELLARIA,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," Come with me, lover."
11443,MORGAN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," Gods, look at this one."
11444,OLYVAR,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room."
11445,MORGAN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil. (Laughs)
11446,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?
11447,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.
11448,MORGAN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, (Screams)
11449,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist."
11450,MORGAN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, (Groans)
11451,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," He'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions."
11452,TYRION,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be..."
11453,TYRION,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, trouble.
11454,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," Apologies, my love."
11455,TYRION,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, I'm here to welcome you to the capital.
11456,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister."
11457,TYRION,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, If there's anything I can do to make your stay...
11458,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, What are you? His hired killer?
11459,BRONN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight."
11460,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, How did that come to pass?
11461,BRONN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," Killed the right people, I suppose."
11462,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?"
11463,TYRION,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," Oh, I partook. Now I'm married."
11464,TYRION,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?"
11465,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.
11466,TYRION,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," Oh, they take all kinds."
11467,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, Even Dornishmen.
11468,TYRION,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.
11469,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all.
11470,TYRION,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult."
11471,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, (Chuckles)
11472,TYRION,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?"
11473,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, I was invited to the royal wedding.
11474,TYRION,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, I thought we were speaking truth.
11475,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city..."
11476,TYRION,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, I wasn't actually present.
11477,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," And butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her?"
11478,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, I'm asking you a question.
11479,TYRION,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, I've heard rumors.
11480,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, (Chuckles) So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.
11481,TYRION,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1, I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.
11482,OBERYN,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts."
11483,JORAH,4,31,two swords,A nearby room in the brothel._1," They're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother."
11484,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,ESSOS EXTERIOR_1, Ser Barristan.
11485,BARRISTAN,4,31,two swords,ESSOS EXTERIOR_1, Your Grace.
11486,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,ESSOS EXTERIOR_1, Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm?
11487,BARRISTAN,4,31,two swords,ESSOS EXTERIOR_1," Gambling, Your Grace."
11488,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,ESSOS EXTERIOR_1, Gambling?
11489,CROWD,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Mhysa. Mhysa. Mhysa...
11490,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, How long have they been at it?
11491,MISSANDEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," Since midnight, Your Grace."
11492,DAARIO,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Ser Worm is stronger than he looks. But I can see his arms beginning to shake.
11493,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?
11494,DAARIO,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.
11495,DENERYS,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.
11496,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.
11497,DAARIO,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, (in valerian) You like this girl? Must be frustrating.
11498,GREY WORM,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," (in valerian) You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis."
11499,DAARIO,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, (in valerian) I'd rather have no brains and two balls.
11500,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, You need to eat something.
11501,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Pigeon pie.
11502,SANSA,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," No, thank you."
11503,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Lemon cakes?
11504,SANSA,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," No, thank you."
11505,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, You love lemon cakes.
11506,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Tell her she needs to eat.
11507,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," My lady, you do need to eat."
11508,SANSA,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, I don't need to eat.
11509,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, If I could have a moment alone with my wife.
11510,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, She needs to eat.
11511,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, I can't let you starve.
11512,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, I swore to protect you.
11513,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you."
11514,SANSA,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, How can you help me?
11515,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," I don't know, but I can try."
11516,SANSA,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.
11517,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.
11518,SANSA,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.
11519,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true."
11520,SANSA,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood."
11521,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear."
11522,SANSA,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.
11523,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, My lion.
11524,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, What are you doing?
11525,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, What does it look like I'm doing? Come here.
11526,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.
11527,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, I know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?
11528,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Of course I haven't forgotten.
11529,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, I want you. Don't you want me?
11530,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,  Things are a bit tense right now.
11531,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, What things?
11532,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.
11533,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, You need to relax.
11534,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Don't you want to relax?
11535,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,  What's wrong?
11536,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, I told you. It's not a good time.
11537,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,  It's never a good time. You have your child bride now.
11538,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,  Shae.
11539,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Do you love her?
11540,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,  Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.
11541,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,  That's not an answer.
11542,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Of course I don't love her.
11543,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, You tried to ship me away.
11544,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Ship you away?
11545,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Give me diamonds and make me disappear.
11546,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,  What in the world are you talking about?
11547,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," If you want me to leave, just say it. Say it!"
11548,TYRION,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,  Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.
11549,SHAE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, You want me to stay?
11550,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, (Groans)
11551,QYBURN,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," A work of art, really. The craftsmanship is excellent."
11552,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it."
11553,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right.
11554,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Days?
11555,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?"
11556,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Uh... a hook would be more practical.
11557,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," Elegant, I think."
11558,CERSIE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Thank you for your help with the other matter.
11559,QYBURN,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, The symptoms have abated?
11560,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn."
11561,QYBURN,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can."
11562,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Odd little man.
11563,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,"  I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?"
11564,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, What symptoms?
11565,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Symptoms that are not your concern.
11566,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, You let him touch you?
11567,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, You jealous?
11568,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.
11569,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, (Laughs) You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.
11570,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
11571,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," Well, they smell like Pycelle."
11572,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, You drink more than you used to.
11573,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Yes.
11574,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Why?
11575,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident."
11576,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, It must have been traumatic for you.
11577,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.
11578,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, A rather short siege.
11579,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So..."
11580,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Father disowned me today.
11581,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, He can't disown you. You're all he's got.
11582,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, You're forgetting Tyrion.
11583,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?"
11584,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
11585,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Not now.
11586,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,  I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.
11587,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Something's changed.
11588,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
11589,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, What do you want me to apologize for?
11590,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, For leaving me.
11591,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?
11592,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.
11593,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you."
11594,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, You took too long.
11595,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,  I... What are you saying?
11596,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,  I'm saying you took too long.
11597,CERSEI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Come in.
11598,JAIME,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Go away.
11599,MAREI,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," Forgive me, Your Grace. You told me to come at once if there was anything important."
11600,TORMUND,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, You plan on killing all the crows yourself?
11601,YGRITTE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?
11602,TORMUND,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1, We wait for Mance's orders.
11603,YGRITTE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back."
11604,TORMUND,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there."
11605,YGRITTE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," Yeah, well, he's a liar."
11606,TORMUND,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," He is? Shouldn't it be ""he was""? You said you put three arrows in him."
11607,YGRITTE,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,  I did.
11608,TORMUND,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1," I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go."
11609,TORMUND,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1, Thenns. I fucking hate Thenns.
11610,TORMUND,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1, Mance sent you?
11611,STYR,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,  (Grunts)
11612,TORMUND,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1, How did you find us?
11613,TORMUND,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1," You came from the south, not the north."
11614,WARG,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1, Took a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way.
11615,STYR,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1, Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?
11616,TORMUND,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1, Help yourself.
11617,STYR,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1, (Chuckles) Maybe everything's just better fed down here.
11618,STYR,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1," Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm?"
11619,STYR,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1," You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?"
11620,TORMUND,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1, I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.
11621,STYR,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1, She yours?
11622,YGRITTE,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1, I'm not anybody's.
11623,STYR,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1, Too scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black.
11624,STYR,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1," Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled."
11625,STYR,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1," I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow."
11626,OFFICER,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1, Draw. Loose.
11627,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. ""He said, "" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. (Winces) The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could."
11628,SAM,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, Sometimes I want to hate you.
11629,SAM,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading."
11630,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, (Chuckles)
11631,SAM,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, They're... they're ready for you.
11632,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.
11633,SAM,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.
11634,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, I've done plenty wrong.
11635,ALLISER THORNE,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?
11636,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, I didn't murder him.
11637,ALLISER THORNE,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,  No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?
11638,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, He wanted me to kill him.
11639,JANOS SLYNT,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?
11640,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
11641,ALLISER THORNE,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.
11642,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."
11643,JANOS SLYNT,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.
11644,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl."
11645,JANOS SLYNT,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," You admit to breaking your vows, then?"
11646,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, I do.
11647,JANOS SLYNT,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, The law is the law. The boy must die.
11648,MAESTER AEMON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men."
11649,ALLISER THORNE,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.
11650,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000."
11651,ALLISER THORNE,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,  Impossible. You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other.
11652,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," 100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him."
11653,JANOS SLYNT,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, (Laughs) Giants?
11654,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?"
11655,JANOS SLUNT,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy."
11656,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.
11657,JANOS SLYNT,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, How dare you?!
11658,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
11659,JON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?
11660,MAESTER AEMON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on."
11661,ALLISER THORNE,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon."
11662,MAESTER AEMON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," Yes, you are."
11663,ALLISER THORNE,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,  And I don't trust the bastard.
11664,MAESTER AEMON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, He told the truth.
11665,ALLISER THORNE,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, And you always know when a man's telling a lie? How did you acquire this magical power?
11666,MAESTER AEMON,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, I grew up in King's Landing.
11667,OLENNA,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," No. No. You're a queen, not an ox."
11668,OLENNA,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.
11669,MARGAERY,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything."
11670,OLENNA,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, Nonsense.
11671,OLENNA,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best."
11672,OLENNA,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that."
11673,MARGAERY,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.
11674,OLENNA,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," You watch that. Even here, even with me."
11675,OLENNA,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, My word.
11676,BRIENNE,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, My lady. My lady. Please pardon me for interrupting. My name is Brienne of Tarth.
11677,OLENNA,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.
11678,OLENNA,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.
11679,BRIENNE,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1," My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment."
11680,OLENNA,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1, You dare not refuse.
11681,MARGAERY,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, A shadow?
11682,BRIENNE,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king."
11683,MARGAERY,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Joffrey is our king now.
11684,BRIENNE,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, I meant no offense.
11685,MARGAERY,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, And you've given none.
11686,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?"
11687,JOFFREY,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," Yes, yes, one guard at the... the thing. Go on."
11688,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.
11689,MERYN,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," I've always guarded the king himself, my lord. Ever since your absence."
11690,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble."
11691,MERYN,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, The people love their king. They know who keeps them fed.
11692,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," Margaery Tyrell, I've heard."
11693,JOFFREY,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, By my leave. They know I saved the city. They know I won the war.
11694,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.
11695,JOFFREY,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," I broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle."
11696,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy."
11697,JOFFREY,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Busy getting captured.
11698,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," So this is the famous ""Book of Brothers""? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. (Chuckles) Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. (Laughs) Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man."
11699,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, So they say.
11700,JOFFREY,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Ser Jaime Lannister. (Chuckles)
11701,JOFFREY,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.
11702,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,  There's still time.
11703,JOFFREY,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,  Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that?
11704,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest."
11705,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Have you ever been to Meereen?
11706,MISSANDEI,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys."
11707,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, And?
11708,MISSANDEI,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen."
11709,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?
11710,MISSANDEI,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"  If they're smart, Your Grace."
11711,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, You were told to ride at the back of the train.
11712,DAARIO,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," Yes, my queen. But I need to speak to you about something important. A matter of strategy."
11713,MISSANDEI,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Your Grace.
11714,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," All right, what is this matter of strategy?"
11715,DAARIO,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, A dusk rose.
11716,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?
11717,DAARIO,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, And this one's called lady's lace.
11718,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Would you like to walk without shoes?
11719,DAAERIO,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," You have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy."
11720,DAARIO,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Harpy's Gold. No tea from this one. Beautiful but poisonous.
11721,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," You are a gambler, aren't you?"
11722,DAARIO,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Your Grace.
11723,JORAH,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.
11724,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, How many miles are there between here and Meereen?
11725,BARRISTAN,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," 163, Your Grace. I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this."
11726,DAENERYS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.
11727,BRIENNE,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, There she is.
11728,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," Yes, there she is."
11729,BRIENNE,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, And? You made a promise.
11730,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.
11731,BRIENNE,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, To keep them safe.
11732,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication."
11733,BRIENNE,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, A complication does not release you from a vow.
11734,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?
11735,BRIENNE,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.
11736,JAIME,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks."
11737,SER DONTOS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,  It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
11738,SANSA,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,  You're drunk.
11739,SER DONTOS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Yes. I have good reason to be. Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool. Don't you know me?
11740,SANSA,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.
11741,SER DONTOS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," I can't accept your apology. I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you."
11742,SANSA,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Anyone would have done the same.
11743,SER DONTOS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," But only you did. I can never repay you. You gave me my life. But this, this is worth more than my life."
11744,SER DONTOS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," It belonged to my mother and her mother before her. House Hollard was strong once. House on the rise. That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me."
11745,SANSA,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't."
11746,SER DONTOS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, I don't have anything else left. That's all. Take it. Wear it. Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.
11747,SANSA,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos."
11748,SER DONTOS,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Yeah.
11749,ARYA,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, When am I going to get a horse of my own?
11750,HOUND,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, The little lady wants a pony.
11751,ARYA,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, The little lady wants away from your stench.
11752,HOUND,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," Horses aren't easy to come by. Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse? Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?"
11753,ARYA,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?
11754,HOUND,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, No.
11755,ARYA,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," You're not very smart, are you?"
11756,HOUND,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, I'm not a thief.
11757,ARYA,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?"
11758,HOUND,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, A man's got to have a code.
11759,ARYA,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1, You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.
11760,HOUND,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1," You've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much."
11761,ARYA,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1, I'm hungry. You're hungry.
11762,HOUND,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1," Five horses, five men. More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach."
11763,ARYA,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1, I know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.
11764,ARYA,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1, He killed Lommy.
11765,HOUND,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1, What the fuck's a Lommy?
11766,ARYA,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1, He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.
11767,HOUND,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1, Got what?
11768,ARYA,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1, My sword Needle.
11769,HOUND,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1,  Needle? Of course you named your sword.
11770,ARYA,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1, Lots of people name their swords.
11771,HOUND,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1, Lots of cunts.
11772,HOUND,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1, What are you... get back here.
11773,ARYA,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1, My brother gave me that sword.
11774,HOUND,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1,  Get back here.
11775,ARYA,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1,  He killed my friend.
11776,HOUND,4,31,two swords,outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings._1, I don't care if he ate your friend. We're not going in there.
11777,MAN,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1," Come on, give it up."
11778,INNKEEPER'S DAUGHER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, (Whimpers)
11779,MAN,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Come here.
11780,INNKEEPER'S DAUGHER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, (Whimpers)
11781,MAN,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Let's have a feel there.
11782,MAN #2,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Leave it.
11783,MAN,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Come here.
11784,INNKEEPER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1," Please, she's a good girl."
11785,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.
11786,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, I know you.
11787,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, You're the Hound.
11788,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Pour our new friend some ale. What brings you so far north?
11789,HOUND,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?
11790,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Just keeping the king's peace.
11791,HOUND,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, No need. The war's over.
11792,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.
11793,HOUND,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, None taken.
11794,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1," He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And what's life without a little fun? (Chuckles)"
11795,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1," But I don't need to tell you that, eh?"
11796,HOUND,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, She's all right. I've had better.
11797,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1," (Laughs) You know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. Always something if you know how to make them talk. And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been."
11798,HOUND,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, I'm not going to King's Landing.
11799,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Think about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go. These are the king's colors. No one's standing in his way now. Which means no one's standing in ours.
11800,HOUND,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Fuck the king.
11801,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1," When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn't believe it. But here you are."
11802,HOUND,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Here I am. Bring me one of those chickens.
11803,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, You got money to pay for it?
11804,HOUND,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, You paid for it?
11805,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1," (Laughs) No. But we're the king's men. So, you got money?"
11806,HOUND,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Not a penny.
11807,HOUND,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, I'll still take that chicken.
11808,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.
11809,HOUND,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.
11810,HOUND,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Ah. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.
11811,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, You don't seem to understand the situation.
11812,HOUND,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1," I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room."
11813,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, You lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens?
11814,HOUND,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Someone is.
11815,ARYA,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1," Something wrong with your leg, boy?"
11816,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, What? What do you mean?
11817,ARYA,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Can you walk? I've got to carry you?
11818,POLLIVER,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Carry me?
11819,ARYA,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Fine little blade.
11820,ARYA,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1, Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
11821,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81, Tansy! Tansy! Tansy!
11822,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81, Tansy! Tansy!
11823,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81, There you are.
11824,TANSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81, (screams)
11825,MYRANDA,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81," (laughing) I can't see her, Ramsay."
11826,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81, Tansy!
11827,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81," If you make it out of the woods, you win! Run, Tansy, run!"
11828,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81, Tansy.
11829,MYRANDA,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81, Where is she?
11830,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81," Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!"
11831,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81," Good girls. Down, girls. Down. Well done. You, too."
11832,MYRANDA,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81,  I only wounded her.
11833,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81,"  You brought her down. That's what matters. A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?"
11834,THEON,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81," A fine shot, master. My lady."
11835,TANSY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81," Please, my lord. It hurts."
11836,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81," Oh, sweet. Don't cry. It will be over soon."
11837,MYRANDA,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81, She thinks she's pretty. Let me put one through her face.
11838,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81," We have to reward the hounds, love. They did all the hard work."
11839,TANSY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81, Why? I did whatever you asked.
11840,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81, But you made Myranda feel jealous.
11841,MYRANDA,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81,  Me jealous of her?
11842,TANSY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81," My lord, please."
11843,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81, You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.
11844,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81, Rip her! Rip her! Rip her!
11845,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,Unnamed Scene_81, Not so pretty now.
11846,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23," Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?"
11847,PODRICK,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23, Is it solid gold?
11848,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23, Gilded steel.
11849,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23, You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
11850,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23, I'm not hungry.
11851,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23," You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her."
11852,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23," A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness."
11853,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23,  Oh!
11854,PODRICK,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23, I'll clean it up.
11855,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23," No, I'll do it. Leave us."
11856,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23, It's only wine.
11857,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23, I can't fight anymore.
11858,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23, What about your left?
11859,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23," I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?"
11860,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23, You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?
11861,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23, I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...
11862,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23," Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand."
11863,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23," With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone."
11864,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING_23," You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one."
11865,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,"A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY_1", My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.
11866,BRONN,4,32,the lion and the rose,"A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY_1", He tells me you shit gold just like your father.
11867,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,"A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY_1", Is this place safe?
11868,BRONN,4,32,the lion and the rose,"A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY_1"," There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield."
11869,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,"A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY_1", Uh-huh.
11870,BRONN,4,32,the lion and the rose,"A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY_1"," Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us."
11871,BRONN,4,32,the lion and the rose,"A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY_1"," I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to."
11872,BRONN,4,32,the lion and the rose,"A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY_1"," And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me."
11873,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,"A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY_1", I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.
11874,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,"A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY_1"," Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard's down."
11875,BRONN,4,32,the lion and the rose,"A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY_1", Best time to attack a man.
11876,BRONN,4,32,the lion and the rose,"A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY_1", Mind yourself. JAIME;  If I still had my right hand...
11877,BRONN,4,32,the lion and the rose,"A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY_1",  Plan on growing it back?
11878,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,"A ROCKY KING'S LANDING SHORELINE, DAY_1"," Come on, then."
11879,MAN,4,32,the lion and the rose,"DREADFORT, NIGHT_1", Open the gates!
11880,MAN,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT COURTYARD_1, Riders coming in! Let's get these horses seen to!

11884,WALDA,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT COURTYARD_1, Hello.
11885,ROOSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT COURTYARD_1," See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down. And take Lady Walda to her chambers."
11886,WOMAN,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT COURTYARD_1," This way, my lady."
11887,ROOSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT COURTYARD_1, Where is your prize?
11888,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT COURTYARD_1, With the hounds. I'll have a look at him.
11889,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT COURTYARD_1, I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.
11890,LOCKE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT COURTYARD_1, Word travels. How he screamed. You would have loved it.
11891,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT COURTYARD_1, (laughs)
11892,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, Father.
11893,ROOSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, What did you do to him?
11894,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned."
11895,ROOSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, You flayed him.
11896,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.
11897,ROOSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.
11898,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, We've been flaying our enemies for a thousand years. The flayed man is on our banners.
11899,ROOSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the Ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin."
11900,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no-
11901,ROOSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
11902,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.
11903,ROOSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.
11904,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us."
11905,ROOSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, I placed far too much trust in you.
11906,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful."
11907,THEON,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,"  I'm sorry, my lord."
11908,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,  Give him the razor.
11909,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?"
11910,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," Go on, Reek. A nice close shave."
11911,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?"
11912,THEON,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," I don't know, my lord."
11913,ROOSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.
11914,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?"
11915,THEON,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," No, my lord. Just two farm boys."
11916,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, And crisped them so no one would know.
11917,THEON,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," Yes, my lord."
11918,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone."
11919,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?"
11920,ROOSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, You ready for a hunt?
11921,MERYN TRANT,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, Always. Find those boys and I'll give you a thousand acres and a holdfast.
11922,LOCKE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?
11923,THEON,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
11924,LOCKE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
11925,ROOSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1, Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.
11926,RAMSAY,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat."
11927,ROOSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1," You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position."
11928,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY_1", Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?
11929,VARYS,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY_1", I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.
11930,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY_1"," Oh, to be foreign."
11931,VARYS,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY_1", Ahem.
11932,VARYS,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY_1", Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.
11933,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY_1", So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.
11934,VARYS,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY_1"," No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear."
11935,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY_1",  Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
11936,VARYS,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY_1", No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.
11937,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY_1"," She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it."
11938,VARYS,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY_1", Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?
11939,MACE,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1," From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup."
11940,MACE,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1, May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.
11941,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1," A handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father?"
11942,MACE,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1," I shall be honored, Your Grace."
11943,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1, She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.
11944,TYWIN,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1, Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.
11945,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1, A book?
11946,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1,"  ""The Lives of Four Kings."" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read."
11947,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1," Now that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom. Thank you, Uncle."
11948,TYWIN,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1," One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor."
11949,PYCELLE,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1," Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel."
11950,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1, So they say.
11951,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1, Such a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?
11952,MAN,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1, Stormbringer.
11953,MAN #2,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1, Terminus.
11954,MAN #3,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1, Widow's Wail.
11955,MAN #4,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1, Wolfsbane.
11956,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,A GARDEN PARTY_1," Widow's Wail. I like that. Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again."
11957,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, Don't.
11958,SHAE,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5," You want me on the desk? What's wrong, my lion?"
11959,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, Don't call me that.
11960,SHAE,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, What should I call you?
11961,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.
11962,SHAE,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, Our friendship?
11963,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.
11964,SHAE,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, What?
11965,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5," You'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants."
11966,SHAE,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, What is this?
11967,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5," I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows."
11968,SHAE,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, She doesn't want you.
11969,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5,  I need to do right by her.
11970,SHAE,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, You don't want her.
11971,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5,  By our children.
11972,SHAE,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, What are you afraid of?
11973,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5,  I'm not afraid.
11974,SHAE,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're going to run from them all your life?
11975,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, I need you to leave.
11976,SHAE,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run.
11977,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, Shae.
11978,SHAE,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5," We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine."
11979,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?
11980,SHAE,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, How many whores have you been with?
11981,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.
11982,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5, You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.
11983,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Hear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness."
11984,AXELL FLORENT,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Sire, I served you well."
11985,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Lord of Light, show us the way..."
11986,AXELL FLORENT,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Selyse, you're my sister!"
11987,SELYSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1", (Chanting with the others) Yours are the stars that guide us.
11988,AXELL FLORENT,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1", Tell him! Tell him!
11989,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors."
11990,SELYSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1", (to STANNIS) Did you see? Their souls. It was their souls. Our lord took them. Did you see?
11991,DAVOS,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1", Lord Florent was your brother by law.
11992,DAVOS,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1"," He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too."
11993,STANNIS,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1", I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.
11994,DAVOS,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1", How many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?
11995,STANNIS,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1", A good deal more than you.
11996,SELYSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1"," Did you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away. Did you see?"
11997,DAVOS,4,32,the lion and the rose,"STANNIS'S STORMLANDS ARMY CAMP, NIGHT_1"," I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen."
11998,STANNIS,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1, Meat's off.
11999,SELYSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1, Our larders are almost empty.
12000,STANNIS,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1," Serve fish, then. We're on an island."
12001,SELYSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1, You hate fish.
12002,STANNIS,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1," I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same."
12003,SELYSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1," (to MELISANDRE) When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?"
12004,STANNIS,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1, Of course I remember.
12005,SELYSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1," Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?"
12006,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1, It's all I knew when I was a child.
12007,SELYSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1, Until you found the Lord of Light?
12008,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1, Until he found me.
12009,SELYSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1, I fear for our daughter's soul.
12010,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1, Every mother should fear for her child's soul.
12011,SELYSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1, She's a stubborn little beast.
12012,STANNIS,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1,  She's a child.
12013,SELYSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1, You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.
12014,STANNIS,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1, She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
12015,SELYSE,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM_1, As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.
12016,SHIREEN,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1, Come in.
12017,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1," Were you sleeping, Princess?"
12018,SHIREEN,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1, (shakes her head)
12019,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1,  Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
12020,SHIREEN,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1, I heard it.
12021,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1, And it frightened you?
12022,SHIREEN,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1, Ser Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.
12023,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1," They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world."
12024,SHIREEN,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1, But they screamed.
12025,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1, Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.
12026,SHIREEN,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1, Afterward they aren't ash and bone.
12027,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1," You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess."
12028,SHIREEN,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1, And you didn't have this.
12029,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1," No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?"
12030,SHIREEN,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1," I read ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""
12031,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1," Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war."
12032,SHIREEN,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1, There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?
12033,MELISANDRE,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM_1," There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now."
12034,HODOR,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT_1", Hodor.
12035,BRAN,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT_1", Why did you wake me?
12036,MEERA,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT_1", You've been gone for hours.
12037,BRAN,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT_1", I was hungry.
12038,MEERA,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT_1", We're all hungry.
12039,BRAN,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT_1", I was just eating.
12040,JOJEN,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT_1"," Summer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran."
12041,JOJEN,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT_1"," Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human."
12042,MEERA,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT_1"," You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything."
12043,BRAN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE NORTH_13," Hodor, take me to the tree."
12044,THREE-EYED RAVEN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE NORTH_13, Look for me... beneath the tree.
12045,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE NORTH_13, He saw us.
12046,THREE-EYED RAVEN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE NORTH_13, North.
12047,BRAN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE NORTH_13, I know where we have to go.
12048,HIGH SEPTON,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_5"," Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul. Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder."
12049,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_5"," With this kiss, I pledge my love."
12050,SANSA,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_5", We have a new queen.
12051,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_5", Better her than you.
12052,TYWIN,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1," Bit much, wouldn't you say?"
12053,OLENNA,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,  It feels proportionate.
12054,TYWIN,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,  Proportionate to what?
12055,OLENNA,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1, The expected extravagance.
12056,TYWIN,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1, People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
12057,OLENNA,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1, You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.
12058,OLENNA,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1," Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking."
12059,OLENNA,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1," Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share."
12060,TYWIN,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1, Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
12061,OLENNA,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1," No, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. ""The Iron Bank will have it's due."" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts."
12062,TYWIN,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1, I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.
12063,OLENNA,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1," We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love."
12064,BRONN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_3, All taken care of.
12065,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_3, You saw her board the ship?
12066,BRONN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_3," Aye, she's on it."
12067,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_3, You saw the ship sail away?
12068,BRONN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_3," No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys."
12069,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_3, How do you know?
12070,BRONN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_3," Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow."
12071,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_3, There's someone following you?
12072,BRONN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_3," She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing."
12073,OBERYN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_3, Hello.
12074,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_3, Hello.
12075,OBERYN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_3, Not you.
12076,OLENNA,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage."
12077,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, My lady. My lady.
12078,OLENNA,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for."
12079,MUSICIAN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," A coat of gold / Or a coat of red / A lion still has claws And mine,  my lord..."
12080,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, Very good. Very good. Off you go.
12081,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, Everyone. The queen would like to say a few words.
12082,MARGAERY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city."
12083,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, You're an example to us all.
12084,LORAS,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry."
12085,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful."
12086,LORAS,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, As does yours.
12087,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," So, looking forward to your wedding?"
12088,LORAS,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," Yes, very much."
12089,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
12090,LORAS,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, They certainly are.
12091,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her."
12092,LORAS,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, And neither will you.
12093,BRIENNE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, Your Grace. My king. My queen.
12094,MARGAERY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,  Lady Brienne. So good of you to come.
12095,BRIENNE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," I'm no lady, Your Grace."
12096,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, Did you just bow?
12097,BRIENNE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy."
12098,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.
12099,MARGAERY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it."
12100,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, A shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.
12101,BRIENNE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,  I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.
12102,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," Yes, yes."
12103,MARGAERY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, Thank you. I hope we see more of you.
12104,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
12105,BRIENNE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," As you say, Your Grace."
12106,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.
12107,BRIENNE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once."
12108,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, Did he? Haven't heard that story before.
12109,BRIENNE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,"  Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid."
12110,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
12111,BRIENNE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1," I don't serve your brother, Your Grace."
12112,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, But you love him.
12113,BRIENNE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1, Your Grace.
12114,PYCELLE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3," No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally."
12115,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3,  She'll do no such thing.
12116,PYCELLE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3," Oh, Your Grace. Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice..."
12117,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3, You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.
12118,MAID,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3, Your Grace.
12119,PYCELLE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3,  Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.
12120,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3, More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?
12121,PYCELLE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3," Your Grace, I am a man of learning."
12122,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3, My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
12123,PYCELLE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3, I never meant to annoy anyone.
12124,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3, But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
12125,PYCELLE,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3," Your Grace, Queen Margaery-"
12126,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3, The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.
12127,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.
12128,TYWIN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, You're in rather a good mood.
12129,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, I suppose I am.
12130,TYWIN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, I won't ask why.
12131,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Small pleasures.
12132,OBERYN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Your Grace. Lord Tywin.
12133,TYWIN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Prince Oberyn.
12134,OBERYN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand."
12135,ELLARIA,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,  My lord. My lady.
12136,TYWIN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Charmed.
12137,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.
12138,ELLARIA,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters."
12139,OBERYN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne."
12140,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, No? How tolerant of you.
12141,OBERYN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked."
12142,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding."
12143,TYWIN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again."
12144,OBERYN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.
12145,TYWIN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
12146,OBERYN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," People everywhere have their differences. In some places, the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place."
12147,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Everyone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords... my ladies..."
12148,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," I give you. King Joffrey... Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings."
12149,RENLY DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, I'm the rightful king.
12150,ROBB DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, King in the North!
12151,JOFFREY DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Yes!
12152,BALON DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Traitor. You're a traitor.
12153,JOFFREY DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, For the Seven Kingdoms!
12154,JOFFREY DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Let the war begin.
12155,STANNIS DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Renly, you're no king."
12156,BALON DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Away, degenerate. Away. Away."
12157,RENLY DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Ooh, careful."
12158,STANNIS DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,  Go on.
12159,RENLY DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, I want you to be my prince. Stannis!
12160,BALON DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Who's got the gold now, Stark?"
12161,ROBB DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, I am the rightful king.
12162,BALON DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Challenge me, ruffian."
12163,ROBB DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Take that.
12164,BALON DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,  I'm drowning. I'm drowning.
12165,ROBB DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, I am the King in the North!
12166,STANNIS DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Not wildfire!
12167,TYRON,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.
12168,PODRICK,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Yes, my lord."
12169,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, We'll have to find another way to thank the king.
12170,JOFFREY DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Charge!
12171,JOFFREY DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Ready, again."
12172,ROBB DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,  I am the King in the North! - Charge!
12173,JOFFREY DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Charge! Yes!
12174,JOFFREY DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Your head!
12175,JOFFREY DWARF,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Fine gentlemen.
12176,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle. How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume."
12177,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night."
12178,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.
12179,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, It did not spill.
12180,MARGAERY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast."
12181,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cup-bearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight."
12182,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Your Grace does me a great honor.
12183,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, (miffed) It's not meant as an honor.
12184,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Bring me my goblet.
12185,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, What good is an empty cup? Fill it.
12186,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Kneel. Kneel before your king.
12187,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Kneel. I said... kneel!
12188,MARGAERY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," (Standing) Look, the pie."
12189,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, My queen.
12190,MARGAERY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Wonderful. Wonderful. My hero.
12191,SANSA,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Can we leave now?
12192,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Let's find out.
12193,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cup-bearer, remember?"
12194,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace."
12195,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are. Serve me my wine."
12196,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Well, hurry up. This pie is dry."
12197,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Mm, good. Needs washing down."
12198,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired."
12199,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," No. (coughing) No, you'll wait here... un..."
12200,TYRION,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Your Grace?
12201,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, It's nothing.
12202,MARGAERY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, He's choking!
12203,OLENNA,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Help the poor boy.
12204,OLENNA,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Idiots, help your king."
12205,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Move away!
12206,JAIME,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Joffrey! Joffrey!
12207,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,  Help him! Someone help him!
12208,JOFFREY,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, (gags)
12209,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Joffrey!
12210,SER DONTOS,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, (to SANSA) Come with me now.
12211,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Joffrey! Joffrey!
12212,SER DONTOS,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," If you want to live, we have to leave."
12213,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, Don't touch him!
12214,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!"
12215,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, My son.
12216,MAN,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5, He's gone. Our king is gone.
12217,CERSEI,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5," He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!"
12218,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, You did this. You did this!
12219,SER DONTOS,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, We have to leave.
12220,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, Take him! Take him!
12221,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?
12222,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.
12223,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, Where is she?!
12224,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, No one leaves the capital! No one!
12225,SER DONTOS,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, Get in.
12226,SANSA,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, Where are we going?
12227,SER DONTOS,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, Somewhere safe.
12228,SER DONTOS,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82," Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know."
12229,SANSA,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, Lord Baelish?
12230,LITTLEFINGER,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82," Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?"
12231,SANSA,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, (shakes her head.)
12232,LITTLEFINGER,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past.  Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.
12233,SER DONTOS,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.
12234,LITTLEFINGER,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82," Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water."
12235,SER DONTOS,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82," I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.  LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?"
12236,SER DONTOS,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82," 10,000."
12237,SER DONTOS,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, Wait!
12238,LITTLEFINGER,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82," Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?"
12239,SANSA,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, I didn't murder anyone.
12240,LITTLEFINGER,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82," I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder."
12241,SANSA,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, Why did you kill him?
12242,LITTLEFINGER,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
12243,SANSA,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, He saved me.
12244,LITTLEFINGER,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82," Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever."
12245,SANSA,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, He was helping me because I saved his life.
12246,LITTLEFINGER,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82," Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard."
12247,LITTLEFINGER,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?
12248,SANSA,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82, We're all liars here.
12249,LITTLEFINGER,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_82," Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home."
12250,MARGAERY,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1, So am I the queen?
12251,OLENNA,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1," More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue."
12252,MARGAERY,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1," Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible."
12253,OLENNA,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1," The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it."
12254,MARGAERY,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1, What was it like?
12255,OLENNA,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1, They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
12256,MARGAERY,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1, One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
12257,OLENNA,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1," Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that."
12258,MARGAERY,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1, But I would have been the queen.
12259,OLENNA,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1, Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
12260,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
12261,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, I'm not trying to trick you.
12262,TOMMEN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, It means I'll become king.
12263,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1," Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?"
12264,TOMMEN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, A good king?
12265,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1," Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?"
12266,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, This is hardly the place or the time.
12267,TOMMEN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Holiness?
12268,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
12269,TOMMEN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Justice.
12270,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
12271,TOMMEN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, No.
12272,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, No.
12273,TOMMEN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, What about strength?
12274,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1," Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?"
12275,TOMMEN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Wisdom.
12276,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Yes!
12277,TOMMEN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Wisdom is what makes a good king.
12278,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
12279,TOMMEN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, No.
12280,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1," No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?"
12281,TOMMEN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, A king needs a queen.
12282,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1," Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?"
12283,TOMMEN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Yes.
12284,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1," Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?"
12285,TOMMEN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.
12286,JAIME,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, How are you?
12287,TOMMEN,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,  I'm all right.
12288,JAIME,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,You are. You will be. I'll see to that.
12289,JAIME,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
12290,HIGH SEPTON,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1," Yes, my lord. All of you."
12291,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1," It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he..."
12292,JAIME,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, I don't know what I saw.
12293,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.
12294,JAIME,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
12295,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1," I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. (CRYING) Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy."
12296,JAIME,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
12297,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1," Jaime, not here, please. Please."
12298,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Stop it. Stop it. Stop.
12299,JAIME,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, No.
12300,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Stop it. Stop.
12301,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, Stop.  Stop. It's not right.
12302,JAIME,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, (GRUNTS)
12303,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, It's not right. It's not right.
12304,JAIME,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,  I don't care.
12305,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, (CRYING)  Don't.
12306,JAIME,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, I don't care.
12307,CERSEI,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1," Don't. Jaime, don't."
12308,JAIME,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1, I don't care.
12309,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, Gonna rain soon. Where are we?
12310,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1," Near Fairmarket, I think."
12311,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, You think? You don't have a map?
12312,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1," No, I don't have a map."
12313,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, Maybe we should get one.
12314,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.
12315,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, How far is it to the Eyrie?
12316,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, Far.
12317,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, And you're sure we're going the right way?
12318,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1," Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way."
12319,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, On your way where?
12320,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,"  Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me."
12321,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, I'd like to see Braavos one day.
12322,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, Why Braavos?
12323,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, I have friends there.
12324,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,  I doubt it.
12325,FARMER HAMLET,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, Seven blessings to you.
12326,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,  What do you want?
12327,FARMER HAMLET,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, What do I want? This is my land.
12328,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,"  If I'm standing on it, it's my land."
12329,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
12330,FARMER HAMLET,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, (nods)
12331,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, He's never been the same.
12332,FARMER HAMLET,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, Which house did he fight for?
12333,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1, The Tullys of Riverrun.
12334,FARMER HAMLET,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1," There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it."
12335,FARMER HAMLET,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
12336,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, You got to do all seven of the fuckers?
12337,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, Father!
12338,FARMER HAMLET,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
12339,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
12340,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, I'm so sorry.
12341,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, Really good.
12342,FARMER HAMLET,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, Did you fight at the Twins?
12343,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
12344,FARMER HAMLET,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
12345,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, Guest right don't mean much anymore.
12346,FARMER HAMLET,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1," It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour."
12347,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, You got any ale?
12348,FARMER HAMLET,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,  Afraid not.
12349,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, How can a man not keep ale in his home?
12350,FARMER HAMLET,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,"  You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense."
12351,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?
12352,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1, (Nods) Fair wages for fair work.
12353,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1, What did you do?!
12354,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,  Get your horse saddled.
12355,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1, You told me you weren't a thief.
12356,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1, I wasn't.
12357,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1, He took us in. He fed us and you...
12358,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1," Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter."
12359,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1, You don't know that.
12360,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1, I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.
12361,ARYA,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1, You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
12362,HOUND,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1, There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
12363,RANGER,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1, Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.
12364,ALLISER THORNE,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1," There he is, Sam the Slayer."
12365,JANOS SLYNT,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1, Going to visit your wildling whore?
12366,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1, She's not a whore.
12367,JANOS SLYNT,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1, No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.
12368,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, They all think I'm lying.
12369,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, About what?
12370,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, Killing the white Walker.
12371,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,  You're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed.
12372,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...
12373,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,  A what?
12374,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1," Well, a wildling."
12375,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, My father hated that word.
12376,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1," It's not a very nice word, I suppose."
12377,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"  I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?"
12378,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, So... are you all right? No one bothering you?
12379,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.
12380,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, I worry about it sometimes. All the time.
12381,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, Why do you worry about it?
12382,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1," 100 men, one woman."
12383,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, They've got other things to think about.
12384,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, That's the only thing they think about.
12385,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, You're being silly.
12386,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,  I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
12387,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, What about you?
12388,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.
12389,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,  Thank you.
12390,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, For what?
12391,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, For worrying about me.
12392,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1," I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep."
12393,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, So what are you saying?
12394,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
12395,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, Are you bored of me?
12396,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.
12397,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,  I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.
12398,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, Your Grace.
12399,STANNIS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?
12400,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, Joffrey?
12401,STANNIS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
12402,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1," I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night..."
12403,STANNIS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, What progress have you made?
12404,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.
12405,STANNIS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, House Peasebury.
12406,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, House Musgood.
12407,STANNIS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,  House Musgood.
12408,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, And House Haigh.
12409,STANNIS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
12410,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1," Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company."
12411,STANNIS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,  The Golden Company?
12412,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, They've never broken a contract.
12413,STANNIS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, They're sellswords.
12414,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1," We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground."
12415,STANNIS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, We don't have any gold.
12416,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, Not yet.
12417,STANNIS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"  If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -"
12418,SHIREEN,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, You're late.
12419,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1," I'm sorry, Princess."
12420,SHIREEN,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, I thought you weren't coming.
12421,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.
12422,SHIREEN,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1," You won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say ""ka-nigit."""
12423,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1," That happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you."
12424,SHIREEN,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words. But I think you can manage.
12425,SHIREEN,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,  You'll never read well if you move your lips. That's how children do it.
12426,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1," ""The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas. First Sword of Braavos."""
12427,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, Thank you very much.
12428,SHIREEN,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates. You were a pirate once.
12429,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1," No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler."
12430,SHIREEN,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, What's the difference?
12431,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1," Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right."
12432,SHIREEN,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, My father says a criminal is a criminal.
12433,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.
12434,SHIREEN,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, You've sailed to Braavos?
12435,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"  Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction..."
12436,SHIREEN,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,  What was that for?
12437,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,  I need you to write a message.
12438,SHIREEN,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, You should write it yourself. It's good practice.
12439,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.
12440,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.
12441,SHIREEN,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, But that's not you.
12442,DAVOS,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1, I need to get their attention. Go on. Write.
12443,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?"
12444,MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Precious little thing.
12445,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Thank you.
12446,MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, What's his name?
12447,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Sam.
12448,MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Lovely. That the daddy?
12449,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, No.
12450,MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Where's the daddy?
12451,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, He's dead.
12452,MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Oh. Where you from?
12453,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, North of here.
12454,MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, North of here? You a fucking wildling?
12455,MOLE'S TOWN MADAM,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Only room and board?
12456,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
12457,MOLE'S TOWN MADAM,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Could find other work for her, too."
12458,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, No other work.
12459,MOLE'S TOWN MADAM,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, There'd be money. Give you a piece of it.
12460,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, No other work.
12461,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?
12462,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, You protected me north of the Wall.
12463,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's."
12464,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, You have to trust me. It's for the best.
12465,GILLY,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Best for you.
12466,SAM,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Oh, Gilly. Please don't."
12467,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Greedy.
12468,ELLARIA,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, No?
12469,OLYVAR,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste."
12470,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?
12471,ELLARIA,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you."
12472,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Your loss.
12473,OLYVAR,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, You like them both the same? Boys and girls?
12474,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Does that surprise you?
12475,OLYVAR,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Everyone has a preference.
12476,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides."
12477,OLYVAR,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.
12478,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," What are you, 25?"
12479,ELLARIA,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Children.
12480,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"  (CHUCKLES) Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day."
12481,OLYVAR,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Did you?
12482,ELLARIA,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
12483,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, They will all have to line up behind you.
12484,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,  Prince Oberyn.
12485,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Lord Tywin.
12486,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, May we have the room?
12487,ELLARIA,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Call my name if you need me, lover."
12488,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Would you like to sit?
12489,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," No, thank you."
12490,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Some wine?
12491,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," No, thank you."
12492,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,  I'm sorry about your grandson.
12493,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Are you?
12494,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.
12495,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Which way is that?
12496,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?"
12497,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Some believe the king choked.
12498,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.
12499,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
12500,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, I did. This is why I know.
12501,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning."
12502,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
12503,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
12504,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, You think we conspired together?
12505,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, What did you discuss?
12506,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, The death of my sister.
12507,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, For which you blame me.
12508,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.
12509,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?"
12510,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow."
12511,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
12512,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
12513,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Categorically.
12514,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, I would like to speak with the Mountain.
12515,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
12516,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
12517,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, I could arrange for this meeting.
12518,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, But you want something in return.
12519,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third."
12520,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Why?
12521,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies."
12522,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting."
12523,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
12524,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin."
12525,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons."
12526,OBERYN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.
12527,TYWIN,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
12528,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Podrick. Apologies for the stench.
12529,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me."
12530,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, A noble effort.
12531,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese."
12532,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
12533,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," I've heard nothing, my lord."
12534,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
12535,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
12536,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
12537,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," No, my lord. You didn't?"
12538,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?"
12539,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Your father.
12540,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Of course.
12541,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Mace Tyrell.
12542,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
12543,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
12544,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
12545,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf."
12546,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa."
12547,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," My lord, she's gone."
12548,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Gone?
12549,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...
12550,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick."
12551,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Yes, my lord?"
12552,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, They'll be following you now.
12553,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Who will?
12554,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
12555,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Any other witnesses, my lord?"
12556,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
12557,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, He's already been called as a witness for the queen.
12558,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
12559,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you."
12560,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Why not?
12561,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
12562,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
12563,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," I'll ask, my lord."
12564,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler."
12565,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
12566,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," I didn't tell them anything, my lord."
12567,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Are you going to accept their offer?
12568,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, My lord.
12569,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."
12570,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," You've been good to me, my lord."
12571,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that."
12572,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," I already gave them an answer, my lord."
12573,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted."
12574,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, My lord.
12575,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell."
12576,PODRICK,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1," Farewell, my lord."
12577,TYRION,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1, Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.
12578,OLLY,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, Mother says it's time to eat.
12579,GUYMON,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.
12580,OLLY,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, Potatoes.
12581,GUYMON,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15," Potatoes. Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom. Has she got..."
12582,MAN,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, The wildlings!
12583,OLLY'S MOTHER,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, Guymon! (to OLLY) Hide. Hide!
12584,STYR,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, You know how to get to Castle Black?
12585,OLLY,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, Yes. Yes.
12586,STYR,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, Those your parents? Open your eyes. I'm going to eat them. Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa. Go tell the crows at Castle Black.
12587,YARWYCK,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.
12588,MEN,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, Aye! Aye!
12589,YARWYCK,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall. Seems like that would be a good lesson.
12590,MEN,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, Aye!
12591,ALLISER THORNE,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15," If we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want. They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time."
12592,MAESTER AEMON,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, We have just over 100 men. And that's including stewards and builders. And me. We can't afford to lose a single man. We must remember our first responsibility. We are the watchers on the Wall.
12593,PYP,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, There's got to be a way to protect them.
12594,ALLISER THORNE,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15," You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow. What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?"
12595,JON,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15," Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them."
12596,ALLISER THORNE,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall. That is our job.
12597,PYP,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, Rangers returning.
12598,JON,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, Help him.
12599,DOLOROUS EDD,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15, Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.
12600,ALLISER THORN,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1, What took you so long?
12601,GRENN,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1, We were held up.
12602,ALLISER THORN,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1, By what?
12603,GRENN,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1, Chains.
12604,DOLOROUS EDD,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1, We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.
12605,JON,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1, And the mutineers stayed?
12606,DOLOROUS EDD,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1, They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
12607,JON,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1, We need to ride north and kill them all.
12608,ALLISER THORN,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1," We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait."
12609,JON,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1,"  It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them."
12610,PYP,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1, I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
12611,DAENERYS,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, Are they attacking?
12612,JORAH,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.
12613,CHAMPION,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,  (SPEAKING VALYRIAN)
12614,DAENERYS,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, What is he doing?
12615,BARRISTAN SELMY,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, I believe he means to...
12616,MISSANDEI,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7," He says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole."
12617,BARRISTAN SELMY,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7," Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words."
12618,JORAH,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
12619,CHAMPION,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, (CONTINUES SPEAKING VALYRIAN)
12620,DAENERYS,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7," I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?"
12621,GREY WORM,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7," (SPEAKING VALYRIAN) Allow me this honor, mother of dragons. I will not disappoint you."
12622,DAEYNERYS,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, (valyrian) You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.
12623,BARRISTAN SELMY,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7," Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive."
12624,DAENERYS,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, Which is why you must remain by my side.
12625,JORAH,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7," I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well."
12626,DAENERYS,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7," You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life."
12627,DAARIO,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7," I was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you."
12628,DAENERYS,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.
12629,MISSANDEI,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7," He is very brave, Your Grace."
12630,DAENERYS,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7," Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching."
12631,DAENERYS,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, You sure you don't want a horse?
12632,DAARIO,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, Why would I want a horse?
12633,DAENERYS,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, Horses are faster than men.
12634,DAARIO,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, Horses are dumber than men.
12635,DAENERYS,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, (valyrian) I am Daenerys Stormborn.
12636,DAENERYS,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7," (valyrian) Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you."
12637,DAENERYS,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!
12638,DAENERYS,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7, Fire!
12639,GREY WORM,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83," My name is Grey Worm. I come from the Summer ""Ills."""
12640,MISSANDEI,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83, Isles. Summer Isles.
12641,GREY WORM,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83, Summer Isles. (speaks Valyrian)
12642,MISSANDEI,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83, (speaks Valyrian) I am from an island called Naath.
12643,GREY WORM,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83, (speaks Valyrian) When they took you?
12644,MISSANDEI,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83," ""When did they take me?"" I was five years old."
12645,GREY WORM,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83, You remember your home?
12646,MISSANDEI,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83, I remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home?
12647,GREY WORM,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83," (Shakes his head.) Unsullied. Always Unsullied. Before Unsullied, nothing."
12648,MISSANDEI,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83, That's not true. Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
12649,GREY WORM,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83, I don't want return. (Speaks Valyrian.)
12650,MISSANDEI,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83, Kill the masters.
12651,GREY WORM,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83, Kill the masters.
12652,DAENERYS,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83, How are the lessons coming?
12653,MISSANDEI,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83," Very well, Your Grace."
12654,GREY WORM,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83," Missandei is teacher good, my queen."
12655,DAENERYS,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_83,  You'll have to continue later. It's time.
12656,MOSSADOR,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1, (speaking Valyrian.) You heard her! She said she came to free us.
12657,ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,  (speaking Valyrian.)  You are a fool. The masters are too strong.
12658,MOSSADOR,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1, (speaking Valyrian.) She will protect us. She defeated the masters' champion.
12659,MOSSADOR,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1, (speaking Valyrian.) She has a great army. You want to live the rest of your days in chains?
12660,MEEREEN SLAVE,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,  (speaking Valyrian.) I want to live. You saw what they did to those children. What do you think they'll do to us?
12661,ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1," (speaking Valyrian.) I've been through two slave revolts, boy. They always end the same way"
12662,GREY WORM,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1, (speaking Valyrian.)  All men must die.
12663,GREY WORM,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1," (speaking Valyrian.) But I promise you, a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains."
12664,ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1, (speaking Valyrian.) Who are you?
12665,GREY WORM,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1," (speaking Valyrian.) This one is called Grey Worm. I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied. Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains."
12666,ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1, (speaking Valyrian.) You are Unsullied? They taught you how to fight before you could walk. We are not soldiers.
12667,MEEREEN SLAVE,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,"  (speaking Valyrian.) We have no training, weapons."
12668,GREY WORM,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1," (speaking Valyrian.) There are three slaves in this city for every Master. No one can give you your freedom, brothers. If you want it, you must take it."
12669,GREAT MASTER #1,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1, (Curses in Valyrian.)
12670,SLAVES,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1, Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
12671,SLAVES,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1, Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
12672,SLAVES,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1, Mhysa! Mhysa!
12673,DAENERYS,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1," Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?"
12674,JORAH,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1," 163, Khaleesi."
12675,DAENERYS,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1," Yes, that was it."
12676,UNSULLIED #1,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1, (shouts in Valyrian.)
12677,BARRISTAN SELMY,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1," Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people,they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy."
12678,DAENERYS,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1, I will answer injustice with justice.
12679,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, What the hell was that?
12680,BRONN,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
12681,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway."
12682,BRONN,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
12683,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, You talk to my brother this way?
12684,BRONN,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, All the time. He got used to it.
12685,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Do you think he did it?
12686,BRONN,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?"
12687,BRONN,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," You haven't been to see him yet, eh?"
12688,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, We're done for today.
12689,BRONN,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
12690,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
12691,BRONN,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?
12692,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months."
12693,TYRION,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Is that supposed to make me feel better?
12694,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
12695,TYRION,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?"
12696,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
12697,TYRION,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Her son?
12698,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Don't. You know what's coming?
12699,TYRION,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed."
12700,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," Now that you mention it, she did ask."
12701,TYRION,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," So, should I turn around and close my eyes?"
12702,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Depends. Did you do it?
12703,TYRION,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
12704,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
12705,TYRION,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," Well, you could set me free."
12706,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, You know I can't.
12707,TYRION,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Then there's really nothing else to say.
12708,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
12709,TYRION,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate."
12710,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
12711,TYRION,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Except I didn't do it.
12712,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my head's on a spike."
12713,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
12714,TYRION,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
12715,TYRION,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway."
12716,SANSA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Where are you taking me?
12717,LITTLEFINGER,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
12718,SANSA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Did you kill Joffrey?
12719,LITTLEFINGER,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
12720,SANSA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, I know it was you.
12721,LITTLEFINGER,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, And who helped me with this conspiracy?
12722,SANSA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king."
12723,LITTLEFINGER,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Why not?
12724,SANSA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
12725,LITTLEFINGER,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Then perhaps it was your husband.
12726,SANSA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, No.
12727,LITTLEFINGER,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, How do you know?
12728,SANSA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, I just do.
12729,LITTLEFINGER,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
12730,SANSA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal."
12731,LITTLEFINGER,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."
12732,SANSA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?"
12733,LITTLEFINGER,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
12734,SANSA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, And what do you want?
12735,LITTLEFINGER,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?"
12736,SANSA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Who could trust you?
12737,LITTLEFINGER,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong."
12738,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.
12739,OLENNA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs."
12740,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, (laughs)
12741,OLENNA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Have you been to see Tommen yet?
12742,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
12743,OLENNA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."
12744,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, (laughs)
12745,OLENNA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,  How absentminded of me.
12746,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Mm-hmm.
12747,OLENNA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk."
12748,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, (laughs)
12749,OLENNA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."
12750,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," Well, he could have done."
12751,OLENNA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," He could have done,but he didn't."
12752,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," You don't know, Grandmother."
12753,OLENNA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?"
12754,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, What? I don't understand.
12755,OLENNA,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
12756,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Bring it through! And again.
12757,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Very nice. Good.
12758,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
12759,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Let's see what you can do.
12760,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," Olly, you just watch for now."
12761,OLLY,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, I can fight.
12762,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.
12763,OLLY,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, I was!
12764,GRENN,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn."
12765,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," You two. Take it slow,  try and disarm each other."
12766,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
12767,LOCKE,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, He wouldn't have learned anything that way.
12768,ALLISER THORNE,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing?
12769,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Grenn and I were helping them.
12770,ALLISER THORN,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1," Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't."
12771,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Someone has to train them.
12772,ALLISER THORNE,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, And that someone isn't you. Go find a chamber pot to empty. Go on. Do it. You traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse. Mormont's not hereto protect you now.
12773,ALLISER THORNE,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, Get back to work. Now! I said now!
12774,JANOS SLYNT,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, The bastard's well-liked.You're not.
12775,ALLISER THORNE,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1, You think I care if they like me? We're at war.
12776,JANOS SLYNT,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,   For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
12777,LOCKE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn."
12778,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
12779,LOCKE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Name's Locke.
12780,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Jon Snow.
12781,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, You fight well.
12782,LOCKE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
12783,ALLISER THORNE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?"
12784,LOCKE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Guess I was wrong.
12785,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," You sent for me, Your Grace?"
12786,CERSEI,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
12787,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
12788,CERSEI,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
12789,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
12790,CERSEI,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
12791,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, What?
12792,CERSEI,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,  I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
12793,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
12794,CERSEI,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, She hoped or did you promise?
12795,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her."
12796,CERSEI,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
12797,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?
12798,CERSEI,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?"
12799,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?"
12800,CERSEI,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
12801,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I had to see him. I had to know for myself.
12802,CERSEI,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,  And?
12803,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," He didn't do it, Cersei."
12804,CERSEI,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander."
12805,TOMMEN,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Ser Pounce?
12806,TOMMEN,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, How did you get past the Kingsguard?
12807,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Kingsguard.
12808,TOMMEN,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
12809,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"  I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride."
12810,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?"
12811,TOMMEN,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Yes. But if my mother found out...
12812,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace..."
12813,TOMMEN,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Yes? Tell me a secret.
12814,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
12815,TOMMEN,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, That's Ser Pounce.
12816,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Very handsome.
12817,TOMMEN,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
12818,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.
12819,TOMMEN,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, No. I don't think I am.
12820,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?
12821,TOMMEN,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," We say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast."
12822,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then."
12823,MARGAERY,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"  Remember, our little secret."
12824,BRIENNE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," ""Ser Jaime Lannister. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year. At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon. Thereafter known as the Kingslayer."""
12825,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.
12826,BRIENNE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Valyrian steel.
12827,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Mmm. It's yours.
12828,BRIENNE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I can't accept this.
12829,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you."
12830,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I hope I got your measurements right.
12831,BRIENNE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.
12832,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I almost forgot. I have one more gift.
12833,BRIENNE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I don't need a squire.
12834,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Of course you do.
12835,BRIENNE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,  He'll slow me down.
12836,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.
12837,PODRICK,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," I won't slow you down, ser... my lady. I promise I'll serve you well."
12838,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.
12839,BRONN,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.
12840,BRONN,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse."
12841,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?
12842,BRIENNE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Oathkeeper.
12843,JAIME,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," Good-bye, Brienne."
12844,PODRICK,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," Come on, move."
12845,SAM,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I should neverhave taken her away.
12846,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, She wasn't safe here.
12847,SAM,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next."
12848,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Castle Black could be next.
12849,SAM,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I should go back for Gilly.
12850,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
12851,SAM,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
12852,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him."
12853,SAM,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did."
12854,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
12855,SAM,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.
12856,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...
12857,SAM,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...
12858,LOCKE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Snow. I don't mean to interrupt. Thorne wants to see you.
12859,ALLISER THORNE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," Your foray to Craster's Keep, I'll sanction it. But I won't order anyone to go with you. Volunteers only."
12860,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," Thank you, Ser Alliser."
12861,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," Ahem, brothers."
12862,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?"
12863,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
12864,LOCKE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," Then let me say my vows. If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how."
12865,ALLISER THORNE,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, (nods)
12866,JON,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," Thank you, brothers."
12867,WOMAN,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," No, don't. Don't, please."
12868,WOMAN #2,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Please don't. Ow! You're hurting me.
12869,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.
12870,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," Any command for us, Lord Commander? What's that? Fuck 'em till they're dead?"
12871,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," Did you hear that, boys? Fuck 'em till they're dead."
12872,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Rast.
12873,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Go outside and feed the beast.
12874,RAST,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, We should kill that thing.
12875,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," You should shuty our fucking hole, ugly little cunt. You look likea fucking ballsack. Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face. I could piss in any gutte rand soak five of you. Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing? Seven silvers. They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again. None of them cocksuckers got away from me."
12876,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," Haven't lost a fight since I was nine. Maybe it's time. What do you think, eh?"
12877,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," Maybe you're the man. Eh, cunt?"
12878,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1," I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley. A fucking legend! I would take any knight... any knight, any time. Fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards."
12879,WOMEN,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,  A gift for the gods.- A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.
12880,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, What the fuck is that?
12881,SISSY,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Craster's last child. A boy.
12882,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, What am I supposed to do with him? What did Craster do with 'em? Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him? All right.
12883,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Don't need another mouth to feed. Hand him over.
12884,SISSY,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, He didn't kill them. He offered them.
12885,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, To who?
12886,SISSY,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, To the gods. The white walkers.
12887,WOMEN,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods.
12888,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Shut up!
12889,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, So... if it worked for him... Let's give the walkers what they want.
12890,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1, Rast is headed that way.
12891,RAST,4,34,oathkeeper,Craster's Keep._1, Pink-eyed fuck. You thirsty?
12892,RAST,4,34,oathkeeper,Craster's Keep._1, Fuck!
12893,HODOR,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1, Hodor.
12894,BRAN,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1, Do you hear that?
12895,MEERA,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1, Is that a baby?
12896,JOJEN,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1, It's coming.
12897,BRAN,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1, I'm going out there.
12898,MEERA,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1," No, we need to stay together."
12899,BRAN,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1, I'm going.
12900,JOJEN,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,  Bran. Bran.
12901,HODOR,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1, Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
12902,MEERA,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1," Bran, what happened?"
12903,BRAN,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1," Summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap."
12904,MEERA,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1, Who?
12905,BRAN,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1," I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf. They have Ghost."
12906,BRAN,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1, They're Night's Watch. Look. Jon might be here.
12907,MEERA,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1," If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?"
12908,MEERA,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1," They might have been Night'sWatch once, not anymore. We're not safe here.We need to go."
12909,BRAN,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1, No.
12910,MEERA,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1," Bran, we need to go now."
12911,BRAN,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1, I'm not leaving without Summer.
12912,MEERA,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1, Can you remember where the cage was?
12913,BRAN,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1, The east side of the keep.
12914,MEERA,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1," If I'm not backsoon, we'll meet..."
12915,HODOR,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1, Hodor.
12916,HODOR,4,34,oathkeeper,inside the keep._1, Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
12917,HODOR,4,34,oathkeeper,inside the keep._1, Hodor.
12918,RAST,4,34,oathkeeper,inside the keep._1," If I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world."
12919,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1, Help him up.
12920,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1, This is nice. Fine leather. You're no wildling. Important. Highborn. Who are you?
12921,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1," You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand. But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods. Isn't that a bit odd?"
12922,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1, I like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?
12923,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1," See you haven't played this game before. A highborn hostage, that's valuable. But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed."
12924,RAST,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1, What the fuck's wrong with him?
12925,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1, Come here.
12926,MEERA,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1," (screams) No, please. Please.Please, let me help him."
12927,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,  Who are you?
12928,MEERA,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1, Please.
12929,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1, Who are you?
12930,BRAN,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,  I'm Brandon Stark! I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
12931,RAST,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1, It's Jon Snow's brother.
12932,MEERA,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1, It's Meera. It's Meera.I'm right here.
12933,TANNER,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1, And I thought this was gonnabe another boring day.
12934,MEERA,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1, I'm right here.

12943,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", There he is.
12944,MARGAERY,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1",  Long may he reign.
12945,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", Long may he reign.
12946,MARGAERY,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1",  He sits the throne like he was born to it.
12947,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?"
12948,MARGAERY,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," No, he wasn't."
12949,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", You still mourn for Joffrey?
12950,MARGAERY,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", He was my husband. My king.
12951,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", He would have been your nightmare.
12952,MARGAERY,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," Your Grace, I feel..."
12953,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?"
12954,MARGAERY,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", No.
12955,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it."
12956,MARGAERY,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1","  It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there."
12957,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", He will need help... if he's going to rule well.
12958,MARGAERY,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", He has you.
12959,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?"
12960,MARGAERY,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," Oh. After all that's happened... It sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it."
12961,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine."
12962,MARGAERY,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1",  We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
12963,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", (CHUCKLES)
12964,MARGAERY,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.
12965,JORAH,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.
12966,BARRISTAN,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," And we have taken the Meereenese Navy, Your Grace."
12967,DAARIO,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", The Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy.
12968,DAENERYS,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", Who told you to take the Navy?
12969,DAARIO,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", No one.
12970,DAENERYS,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", So why did you do it?
12971,DAARIO,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", I heard you liked ships.
12972,DAENERYS,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", How many ships?
12973,BARRISTAN,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," Ninety-three, Your Grace."
12974,DAENERYS,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", How many men can they carry?
12975,BARRISTAN,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," Ninety-three hundred, not counting sailors."
12976,DAENERYS,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", Would that be enough to take King's Landing?
12977,JORAH,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", The Lannisters have more.
12978,BARRISTAN,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. Eight thousand Unsullied, two thousand Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning."
12979,JORAH,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you Queen of King's Landing. Ten thousand men can't conquer Westeros.
12980,BARRISTAN,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
12981,JORAH,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have."
12982,JORAH,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've re-enslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself ""His Imperial Majesty."""
12983,DAENERYS,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," Please leave me. Not you, Jorah."
12984,DAENERYS,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1",  It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
12985,JORAH,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.
12986,DAENERYS,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.
12987,JORAH,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", (chuckles)
12988,DAENERYS,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
12989,JORAH,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
12990,DAENERYS,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.
12991,JORAH,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," What, then?"
12992,DAENERYS,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", I will do what queens do. I will rule.
12993,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.
12994,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", But how would they know?
12995,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
12996,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
12997,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand."
12998,KNIGHT,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
12999,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece, Alayne."
13000,KNIGHT,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", Stand to.
13001,KNIGHT #2,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", Stand to!
13002,KNIGHT #3,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1", Stand to!
13003,KNIGHT,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1"," Welcome back, Lord Baelish."
13004,ROBIN,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", Uncle Petyr!
13005,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", My lord.
13006,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", Oh. I have brought you a gift.
13007,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", Lord Baelish.
13008,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", My lady.
13009,ROBIN,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
13010,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
13011,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1"," It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al..."
13012,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1"," Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me."
13013,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", My flesh and blood.
13014,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1"," It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa."
13015,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
13016,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", Of course. I understand.
13017,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.
13018,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", I would never say a thing.
13019,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.
13020,ROBIN,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
13021,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1"," They did, and my father's."
13022,ROBIN,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1"," They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't."
13023,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", Make him fly?
13024,ROBIN,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", Through the Moon Door.
13025,ROBIN,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", (giggles)
13026,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1"," And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll."
13027,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
13028,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?
13029,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", No. We never...
13030,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1"," Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin."
13031,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1"," It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin."
13032,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1"," Robin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs."
13033,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", Go. We'll speak soon.
13034,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", What took you so long?
13035,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1"," Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive."
13036,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
13037,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", Let's get married tonight.
13038,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
13039,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1"," There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me."
13040,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", I do think that we could wait until...
13041,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1"," I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?"
13042,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", Like it was yesterday.
13043,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1"," What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husband's wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters..."
13044,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
13045,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", (nods)
13046,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","  Tonight it is, then."
13047,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1", (laughs)
13048,LITTLEFINGER,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","  Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately."
13049,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1"," I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea."
13050,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", When will the wedding take place in your mind?
13051,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
13052,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",  A fortnight?
13053,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", That seems reasonable.
13054,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals."
13055,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", (shakes her head)
13056,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", And your wedding to Loras?
13057,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Shortly after Tommen's.
13058,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Shortly?
13059,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", A fortnight.
13060,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
13061,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", We had that in common.
13062,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
13063,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Then whom can we trust?
13064,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Ourselves alone.
13065,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
13066,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Robert wasn't particularly rich.
13067,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
13068,CESEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
13069,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
13070,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Haven't a clue.
13071,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Go on, your best guess."
13072,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Pounds, tons, ounces?"
13073,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
13074,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", That can't be.
13075,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
13076,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Then how do we pay for anything?
13077,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
13078,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", How much?
13079,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", A tremendous amount.
13080,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement."
13081,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
13082,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
13083,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect."
13084,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do."
13085,TYWIN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you."
13086,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
13087,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
13088,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
13089,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Would you shut up?
13090,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I can't sleep until I say the names.
13091,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
13092,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Only the ones I'm going to kill.
13093,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," (chuckles) Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list."
13094,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," If he were here right now, what would you do?"
13095,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men."
13096,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I'm almost done. Only one name left.
13097,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Go on.
13098,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", The Hound.
13099,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Thank you.
13100,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?"
13101,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",  Really?
13102,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","  Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat."
13103,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food."
13104,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?"
13105,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
13106,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder."
13107,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Yes. I'm very lucky.
13108,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", He feels responsible for you.
13109,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful."
13110,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?
13111,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much."
13112,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Loved your mother.
13113,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", No.
13114,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", That's what you wanted to say.
13115,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you."
13116,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?"
13117,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", No.
13118,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?
13119,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," No, never."
13120,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Are you pregnant?
13121,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-"
13122,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?
13123,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Aunt Lysa, no, I-"
13124,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Your young, pretty body."
13125,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Nothing. I'm a virgin.
13126,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Don't lie to me.
13127,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", You're hurting me.
13128,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I'll know if you lie.
13129,SANSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever."
13130,LYSA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",  Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm.
13131,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?
13132,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters."
13133,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather."
13134,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", That's a long way off.
13135,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point."
13136,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Never, my lady. I'm your squire."
13137,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now.
13138,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," All knights have squires, my lady."
13139,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you."
13140,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," I swore an oath, my lady."
13141,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.
13142,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I know.
13143,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", What do you think will happen if you leave?
13144,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.
13145,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", The hell you doing?
13146,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Practicing.
13147,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," What, ways to die?"
13148,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",  No one's going to kill me.
13149,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", They will if you nance around like that. That's no way to fight.
13150,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", It's not fighting. It's water dancing.
13151,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?
13152,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos."
13153,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","  Braavos. (SCOFFS) Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet. They all are."
13154,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", What do you know about anything?
13155,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.
13156,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", It was not.
13157,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Was? He dead?
13158,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",  Yes.
13159,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", How?
13160,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", He was killed.
13161,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Who by?
13162,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn-
13163,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",  Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
13164,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",  He was outnumbered.
13165,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",  Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
13166,ARYA,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.
13167,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","  The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? (LAUGHS) All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends."
13168,THE HOUND,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Your friend's dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword. (SCOFFS)
13169,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Your Grace.
13170,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?
13171,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","  A poem, actually."
13172,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", May I show you the gardens?
13173,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",  I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
13174,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," No, you couldn't."
13175,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I didn't realize you were a poet.
13176,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Not a very good one.
13177,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", For your paramour?
13178,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", For one of my daughters.
13179,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," You have several, don't you?"
13180,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Eight.
13181,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Eight? Eight daughters?
13182,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.
13183,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Beautiful name.
13184,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry."
13185,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?"
13186,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Which joke is that?
13187,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
13188,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", We can avenge them.
13189,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Yes, we can avenge them."
13190,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
13191,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I know he did.
13192,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
13193,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year."
13194,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun."
13195,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.
13196,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
13197,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again."
13198,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Anything at all.
13199,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.
13200,OBERYN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
13201,CERSEI,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.
13202,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Oh, no, no, no."
13203,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," No, no, no, no."
13204,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Hells. Gods.
13205,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Did you remove the skin?
13206,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," No, my lady."
13207,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?
13208,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," No, my lady."
13209,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
13210,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," No, my lady. That was the cooks."
13211,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", What are you doing?
13212,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I'm helping you with your armor.
13213,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much."
13214,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?
13215,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.
13216,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?"
13217,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I killed a man.
13218,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Who?
13219,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", A Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
13220,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", How did you kill a Kingsguard?
13221,PODRICK,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
13222,BRIENNE,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",  Bloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps.
13223,RAST,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Hey. Hey, get up. Get up."
13224,MAN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1"," That's it lad, put it inside. Get the fire going again. We're all freezing."
13225,MAN #2,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Aye. What we need is a girl there.
13226,MAN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", I've got to have a piss.
13227,MAN,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1", Now keep quiet.
13228,MEERA,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7, You need water.
13229,JOJEN,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7, It doesn't matter.
13230,MEERA,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7, Of course it matters.
13231,JOJEN,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7, You mustn't let anything stop you.
13232,BRAN,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7, They already have stopped me.
13233,JOJEN,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7, No. You're not here. You're far from here.
13234,MEERA,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7, What does that mean?
13235,JOJEN,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7, At the hill. A great weirwood tree.
13236,BRAN,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7," You've seen it, too."
13237,JOJEN,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7," Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. We have to find it. You have to make it."
13238,BRAN,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7, We will.
13239,JOJEN,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7, This... this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.
13240,MEERA,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7, How... will we know the end?
13241,JOJEN,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7, You'll know.
13242,LOCKE,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9, Brothers.
13243,DOLOROUS EDD,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9, You do move quiet.
13244,JON,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9, How many?
13245,LOCKE,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9, Eleven men. Most of them already drunk. No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world. We'll carve them up like walnut pie.
13246,GRENN,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9, Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom. I've seen what he can do with a knife.
13247,LOCKE,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9, Have you seen what I can do with a knife?
13248,GRENN,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9, (chuckles) Not yet.
13249,LOCKE,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9, There's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.
13250,JON,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9, Why?
13251,LOCKE,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9," They've got some hounds chained up inside. Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better."
13252,GRENN,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9, New moon tonight.
13253,JON,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9, (sighs) Get some rest. We move at sundown.
13254,KARL TANNER,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", I've always liked a girl with curls. A touch of class. You take whatever's left.
13255,KARL TANNER,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", Get her up.
13256,BRAN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", Stop.
13257,JOJEN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", Stop. What are you doing?
13258,HODOR,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
13259,BRAN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", Stop. Stop!
13260,HODOR,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", Hodor. Hodor.
13261,BRAN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", Stop! Please.
13262,HODOR,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", Hodor.
13263,BRAN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7","  Please, get off her!"
13264,HODOR,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7",  Hodor. Hodor.
13265,BRAN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7"," Please! Please, leave her alone!"
13266,BRAN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7"," Please, stop. Stop."
13267,BRAN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", What are you doing? Leave her alone!
13268,HODOR,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7",  Hodor. Hodor.
13269,BRAN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", No!
13270,KARL TANNER,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7"," Shh. Shh, shh, shh."
13271,MEERA,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", (gasps)
13272,KARL,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", Shh.
13273,MEERA,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", (whimpers)
13274,KARL TANNER,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7"," You've got pretty hair, don't you? Now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh? You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you? No dresses for you. You like it rough, don't you? You like it in the gutter, don't you?"
13275,JOJEN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7"," If you let my sister go, I can help you."
13276,KARL TANNER,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", You can help me?
13277,JOJEN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", I can.
13278,KARL TANNER,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", And how you gonna do that?
13279,JOJEN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", I have the sight. I can see things.
13280,KARL TANNER,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", That's very helpful.
13281,JOJEN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", Things that haven't happened yet.
13282,KARL TANNER,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", What a fine thing. A fine thing.
13283,KARL TANNER,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", Have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister? Have you seen what they're going to do to your sister?
13284,JOJEN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", No.
13285,KARL TANNER,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", Don't close your eyes.
13286,JOJEN,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7", I saw you die tonight. I saw your body burn. I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.

13332,JON,4,35,first of his name,The woods outside the Keep_1, It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.

13338,DAVOS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found. Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos. Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest--"
13339,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," Welcome to the Iron Bank. Please, sit."
13340,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?"
13341,DAVOS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
13342,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
13343,STANNIS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, He shares no blood with me. He is a bastard born of incest. As was his brother before him.
13344,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," Yes, we have heard this story."
13345,STANNIS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, It's not a story. It's the truth.
13346,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, The king's grandfather tells a different story. A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
13347,STANNIS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, Gold you loaned him.
13348,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
13349,STANNIS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, More than any man living.
13350,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like ""usurper"" and ""madman"" and ""blood right."" Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?"
13351,STANNIS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," 4,000."
13352,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay."
13353,DAVOS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, 32.
13354,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?"
13355,STANNIS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, None.
13356,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.
13357,DAVOS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, My lord.
13358,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles."
13359,DAVOS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another.  {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers."
13360,DAVOS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive."
13361,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, The war is over.
13362,DAVOS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?"
13363,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, Ser Davos...
13364,DAVOS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, Humor me.
13365,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,  Tywin Lannister.
13366,DAV OS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, How old is Tywin Lannister?
13367,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,  67.
13368,STANNIS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," 67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?"
13369,TYCHO,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1, That is a problem for another time.
13370,DAVOS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1," Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it."
13371,SALLADOR,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Braavosi bathhouse._1," The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way. The captain shouts to his first mate, ""Bring me my red shirt."" The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on. And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory. A few days later, the lookout screams, ""Two pirate ships!"" The crew is shivering like scared mice. But the courageous captain hollers, ""Bring me my red shirt!"""
13372,SALLADOR,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Braavosi bathhouse._1," After the battle, the first mate asks, ""Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?"" The captain replies, ""So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed."" The next morning the lookout screams, ""10 pirate ships! We are surrounded!"" The crew goes silent."

13377,DAVOS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Braavosi bathhouse._1, Only half rotted.

13384,SALLADOR,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Braavosi bathhouse._1, Once I thought this man loved me. Now I know he despises me. He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold--
13385,DAVOS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Braavosi bathhouse._1, You won't be alone. And you won't be poor.
13386,DAVOS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Braavosi bathhouse._1, There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house. I gave it to your wife.
13387,SALLADOR,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Braavosi bathhouse._1," You're not my friend, my friend."

13455,DAENERYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1, Then it is my honor to receive you.
13456,HIZDAHR,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1," My father, one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks. This pyramid included."
13457,DAENERYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1," For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him."
13458,HIZDAHR,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1," You have, Your Grace. You crucified him. I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly."
13459,DAENERYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1, Your father crucified innocent children.
13460,HIZDAHR,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1," My father spoke out against crucifying those children. He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled. Is it justice to answer one crime with another?"
13461,DAENERYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1," I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that."
13462,HIZDAHR,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1, What's done is done. You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen. A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
13463,DAENERYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1, And what traditions do you speak of?
13464,HIZDAHR,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1," The tradition of funeral rite. Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun."
13465,HIZDAHR,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1," Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials."
13466,DAENERYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1, And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
13467,HIZDAHR,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1," Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters. I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father. Let me take his body down. Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world."
13468,DAENERYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1," Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq."
13469,HIZDAHR,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1," Thank you, my queen."
13470,DAENERYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1, How many more?
13471,MISSANDEI,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1," There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace."
13472,DAENERYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1,  212?
13473,DAENERYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Meereen throne room._1, Send the next one in.
13474,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1," These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night. So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?"
13475,MACE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you--
13476,MACE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1," Lord Tywin, it's a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council. I--"
13477,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, The trial begins this afternoon. We only have the morning for affairs of state. Shall we begin?
13478,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1," Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord."
13479,CERSEI,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, A coward and a traitor.
13480,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1," My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase ""fuck the king"" was uttered."
13481,PYCELLE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, Disgraceful.
13482,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
13483,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, 10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.
13484,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, Make it 100. What else?
13485,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1," More whispers from the east, my lord."
13486,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, The Targaryen girl?
13487,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
13488,CERSEI,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, Conquered with what?
13489,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1," She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons."
13490,CERSEI,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1," Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace."
13491,PYCELLE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, Mormont is spying on her for us.
13492,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1," No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated."
13493,CERSEI,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.
13494,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
13495,CERSEI,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
13496,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1," A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace."
13497,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, Lord Varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.
13498,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1, Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.
13499,PYCELLE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1," How, my lord? By force?"
13500,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1," Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?"
13501,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1," Most certainly, my Lord Hand."
13502,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,King's Landing Small Council room._1," Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper."
13503,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, Prince Oberyn.
13504,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, Lord Varys...
13505,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.
13506,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, And yet everyone does.
13507,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?
13508,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, Five years.
13509,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, May I ask why?
13510,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, 'Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.
13511,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, Most of us aren't princes.
13512,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, You are from Essos. Where? Lys?
13513,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.
13514,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?
13515,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, It's a long story.
13516,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, One you don't like telling people.
13517,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, People I trust.
13518,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1," My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but..."
13519,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, You did like boys before?
13520,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, (shakes his head)
13521,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,  Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
13522,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1," Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either."
13523,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,  What then?
13524,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,  Nothing.
13525,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, Everybody is interested in something.
13526,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1," Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things."
13527,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1, Such as?
13528,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,TYRION's cell_1," Let me guess, I've been pardoned."
13529,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,TYRION's cell_1, Really?
13530,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,TYRION's cell_1, Father's orders.
13531,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,TYRION's cell_1," Well, we mustn't disappoint Father."
13532,MAN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1", Kingslayer!
13533,TOMMEN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1"," I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial. Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead. And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell. And if found guilty... may the gods punish the accused."
13534,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1"," Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?"
13535,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1", No.
13536,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1"," Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?"
13537,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1", Not that I know of.
13538,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1"," How would you say he died, then?"
13539,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1", Choked on his pigeon pie.
13540,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1", So you would blame the bakers?
13541,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1", Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
13542,TWYIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1", The crown may call its first witness.
13543,MERYN TRANT,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._1"," Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed."
13544,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._1"," Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?"
13545,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._1", Silence.
13546,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._1", Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
13547,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._1"," Silence! You will not speak unless called upon. You're dismissed, Ser Meryn."
13548,PYCELLE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3"," Basilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance... blind eye--"
13549,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3"," I think you have made your point, Grand Maester. You have a lot of poison in your store."
13550,PYCELLE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3"," Had, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered."
13551,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3", By whom?
13552,PYCELLE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3"," By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned."
13553,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3"," Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?"
13554,PYCELLE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3", Without question.
13555,PYCELLE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3"," This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool. He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast. She wore this necklace the day of the wedding. Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside."
13556,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3", Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
13557,PYELLE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3", It was. The Strangler. A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
13558,CERSEI,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._5"," ""I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid."""
13559,MACE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._5", Your own brother said this to you?
13560,CERSEI,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._5"," (Nods.) Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops."
13561,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._5"," Tyrion said, ""And you will know the debt is paid."" What debt?"
13562,CERSEI,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._5", I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.
13563,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._5", (shakes his head)
13564,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._5"," Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony."
13565,MACE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
13566,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7"," I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, ""Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."""
13567,MACE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
13568,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
13569,TWYIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7"," You're excused, Lord Varys."
13570,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7"," Father, may I ask the witness one question?"
13571,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", One.
13572,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7"," You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?"
13573,VARYS,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7"," Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing."
13574,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", We will adjourn for now.
13575,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", Toll the bells in an hour's time.
13576,GUARD,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", Clear the court!
13577,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", You'd condemn your own son to death?
13578,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
13579,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
13580,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", I know nothing of the sort.
13581,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",  You've always hated Tyrion.
13582,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", He killed his king.
13583,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
13584,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",  It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
13585,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",  Justice?
13586,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7"," I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly."
13587,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", He'll be executed.
13588,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7","  No, he'll be punished accordingly."
13589,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7"," Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line."
13590,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", I'm well aware of your oath.
13591,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?
13592,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
13593,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
13594,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", Done.
13595,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7"," When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again."
13596,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", You have my word.
13597,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7", And you have mine.
13598,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3," Not going well, is it?"
13599,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, You're going to be found guilty.
13600,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3," Oh, you think so?"
13601,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3," When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch."
13602,TYRIOM,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
13603,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
13604,YTRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, How do you know?
13605,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Do you trust me?
13606,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, (nods)
13607,JAIME,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.
13608,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, The crown may call its next witness.
13609,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, State your name.
13610,SHAE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Shae.
13611,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
13612,SHAE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, I swear it.
13613,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Do you know this man?
13614,SHAE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
13615,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, How do you know him?
13616,SHAE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
13617,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?
13618,SHAE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, I know that he's guilty.
13619,SHAE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, He and Sansa planned it together.
13620,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Silence! Continue.
13621,SHAE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3," She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord."
13622,SHAE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
13623,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
13624,SHAE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.
13625,MACE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, I beg your pardon? You said you were his...
13626,SHAE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, His whore.
13627,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, How did you come to be in his service?
13628,SHAE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3," He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. ""You belong to me now,"" he said. ""I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."""
13629,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Silence. Silence!
13630,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, And did you?
13631,SHAE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Did I what?
13632,OBERYN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
13633,SHAE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3," I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him ""my lion,"" so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, ""I am yours and you are mine."""
13634,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Shae. Please don't.
13635,SHAE,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3," I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her."
13636,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3," Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess."
13637,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, You wish to confess?
13638,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
13639,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?
13640,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3," Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?"
13641,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, You admit you poisoned the king?
13642,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3," No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf."
13643,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
13644,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3," Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life."
13645,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Have you nothing to say in your defense?
13646,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3," Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had."
13647,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3," (To Cersei) Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores."
13648,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, (To the crowd) I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
13649,TYWIN,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
13650,TYRION,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3, I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.
13651,JAIME,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
13652,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?"
13653,JAIME,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"
13654,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it."
13655,JAIME,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You fell in love with a whore.
13656,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
13657,JAIME,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
13658,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, At least I got to tell them what they really are.
13659,JAIME,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."
13660,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
13661,JAIME,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
13662,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
13663,JAIME,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, (laughs)
13664,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
13665,JAIME,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, It is tempting.
13666,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life."
13667,JAIME,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, If he wins.
13668,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
13669,JAIME,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, No. Not Ser Meryn.
13670,GUARD,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Go on, move it."
13671,GUARD,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, And you. Come on.
13672,PRISONER #2,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Mercy. Please. Please, mercy."
13673,CERSEI,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.
13674,CERSEI,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You seem to be in good form.
13675,THE MOUNTAIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Who am I fighting?
13676,CERSEI,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Does it matter?
13677,THE MOUNTAIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, (Shakes his head.)
13678,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Could be food.
13679,ARYA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Could be soldiers.
13680,ARYA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
13681,DYING MAN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down."
13682,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Who were ""they""?"
13683,DYING MAN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I stopped asking a while ago.
13684,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, That's not gonna get better.
13685,DYING MAN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Doesn't seem so.
13686,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?
13687,DYING MAN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.
13688,ARYA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, So why go on?
13689,DYING MAN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Habit.
13690,ARYA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Nothing could be worse than this.
13691,DYING MAN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Maybe nothing is worse than this.
13692,ARYA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.
13693,DYING MAN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Who are you?
13694,ARYA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, My name is Arya. Arya Stark.
13695,DYING MAN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You her father?
13696,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, (Shakes his head.) Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
13697,DYING MAN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work."
13698,DYING MAN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Wish it were wine.
13699,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, So do I.
13700,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.
13701,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, The fuck you doing?
13702,RORGE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, There's a price on your head.
13703,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
13704,RORGE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.
13705,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?"
13706,ARYA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
13707,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?
13708,ARYA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, He can't be. I don't know his name.
13709,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, What's your name?
13710,RORGE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,  Rorge.
13711,ARYA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Thank you.
13712,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You're learning.
13713,MAN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Rangers returning!
13714,MAN #2,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, They return!
13715,MAN #2,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Rangers returning!
13716,JON,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Greetings.
13717,MAN #3,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Didn't think I'd see you again.
13718,SAM,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," All right, Jon?"
13719,MAN #4,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Welcome back, brother."
13720,ALLISER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Lord Snow.
13721,ALLISER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.
13722,JON,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Come on, Ghost."
13723,JON,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
13724,JANOS SLYNT,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?"
13725,JON,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, We need to prepare.
13726,ALLISER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, We've been preparing.
13727,JON,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
13728,ALLISER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, And how would we range north?
13729,JON,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, We wouldn't.
13730,ALLISER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?"
13731,GRENN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, We can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.
13732,ALLISER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel."
13733,JON,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have."
13734,ALLISER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.
13735,JON,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, They won't stop them.
13736,ALLISER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow."
13737,JON,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, The stewards.
13738,ALLISER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
13739,JON,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, No.
13740,ALLISER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Who would that be?
13741,JON,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, The builders.
13742,ALLISER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,"Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?"
13743,YARWICK,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, (Pauses.) No.
13744,ALLISER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Given your deep knowledge of the Wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon."
13745,ALLISER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Moving on. First Builder, we'll need a hundred barrels of pitch brought atop the wall."
13746,YARWICK,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Aye.
13747,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, My lord.
13748,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You have new clothes.
13749,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,  Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
13750,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I sent for you days ago.
13751,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,  I've been a bit busy.
13752,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Doing what?
13753,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
13754,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
13755,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
13756,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, She's dim-witted.
13757,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," If I wanted wits, I'd marry you."
13758,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?"
13759,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister."
13760,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, And you understand the rules of inheritance?
13761,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Falyse is forty and barren.
13762,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
13763,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
13764,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, (scoffs.)
13765,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
13766,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
13767,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price."
13768,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Is it two wives you want or two castles?
13769,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle."
13770,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
13771,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?
13772,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
13773,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Your sister's a Lannister, too."
13774,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."
13775,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink."
13776,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Does he frighten you so much?
13777,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"
13778,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Because you're my friend.
13779,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?"
13780,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more."
13781,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I understand.
13782,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I'm sorry it has to be this way.
13783,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
13784,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, We had some good days together.
13785,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Yes, we did."
13786,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, What will you do?
13787,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
13788,BRONN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I hope to hear them sing it one day.
13789,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,"
13790,DAARIO,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, But your window is not.
13791,DAARIO,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
13792,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Don't do that again.
13793,DAARIO,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.
13794,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you."
13795,DAARIO,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you."
13796,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Tell me why you're here.
13797,DAARIO,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents."
13798,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
13799,DAARIO,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You've ordered us to be night watchmen.
13800,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue."
13801,DAARIO,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," There is only one, and she does not want me."
13802,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You swore me your sword.
13803,DAARIO,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, My sword is yours till the day I die.
13804,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
13805,DAARIO,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.
13806,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Very well.
13807,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Do what you do best.
13808,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Take off your clothes.
13809,SELYSE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Oh.
13810,MELISANDRE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Come in, my queen. Please."
13811,SELYSE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady."
13812,MELISANDRE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You could never disturb me.
13813,SELYSE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
13814,MELISANDRE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
13815,MELISANDRE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one."
13816,MELISANDRE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, ""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count."" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid."
13817,SELYSE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, It was. I- humor isn't my strength.
13818,MELISANDRE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
13819,SELYSE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?"
13820,MELISANDRE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Not always.
13821,MELISANDRE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lord's power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust."
13822,SELYSE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Did you use it with Stannis?
13823,MELISANDRE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
13824,MELISANDRE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.
13825,SELYSE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home."
13826,MELISANDRE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I understand how you feel.
13827,SELYSE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Hmm.
13828,MELISANDRE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, But that is impossible.
13829,SELYSE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Why?
13830,MELISANDRE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself."
13831,MELISANDRE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her."
13832,DAARIO,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.
13833,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Khaleesi.
13834,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You're here early.
13835,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Later than some.
13836,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You don't approve?
13837,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust."
13838,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You neither approve nor trust.
13839,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
13840,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
13841,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I did.
13842,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I trust you.
13843,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
13844,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
13845,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You have?
13846,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I have.
13847,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control."
13848,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself."
13849,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."
13850,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
13851,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
13852,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
13853,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi."
13854,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
13855,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
13856,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
13857,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Hizdahr zo Loraq?
13858,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
13859,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, (Nods.)
13860,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,"  Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind."
13861,JORAH,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Yes, Khaleesi."
13862,DAENERYS,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, No. Tell him you changed my mind.
13863,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Rat cunts. Fucking whore.
13864,ARYA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-"
13865,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, No fire.
13866,ARYA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.
13867,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, No fire!
13868,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Shut up about it. Shut up about everything. Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going."
13869,HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword."
13870,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
13871,ARYA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Why?
13872,THE HOUND,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?"
13873,ARYA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
13874,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
13875,PODRICK,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Couldn't agree more, my lady."
13876,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.
13877,PODRICK,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Yes, my lady."
13878,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Don't get drunk.
13879,PODRICK,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," No, my lady."
13880,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Can I get you anything else?
13881,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful."
13882,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Thanks. I do my best.
13883,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?"
13884,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, No.
13885,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?"
13886,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, We're looking for someone.
13887,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had seventeen-
13888,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name."
13889,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Starks? What, like them lot from ""Winterhell""?"
13890,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," No, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here."
13891,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,  I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
13892,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?
13893,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, What?
13894,PODRICK,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," It's nothing, my lady."
13895,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,  You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
13896,PODRICK,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't."
13897,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
13898,PODRICK,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
13899,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
13900,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, What about? Not kidney pie.
13901,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.
13902,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.
13903,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, She weren't when I last spoke to her.
13904,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,  When was that?
13905,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry."
13906,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,  So what happened to her?
13907,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Well-
13908,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, The quick version.
13909,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.
13910,PODRICK,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, The Hound.
13911,HOT PIE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better."
13912,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,"  Um, you were saying?"
13913,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,"  Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun."
13914,PODRICK,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady."
13915,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Why the Eyrie?
13916,PODRICK,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who."
13917,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Sansa could be there, too."
13918,PODRICK,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Aye, my lady. Could be."
13919,BRIENNE,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,  You sure about this?
13920,PODRICK,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, No.
13921,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
13922,OBERYN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
13923,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like."
13924,OBERYN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Your sister.
13925,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Oh.
13926,OBERYN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.
13927,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
13928,OBERYN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.
13929,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
13930,OBERYN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago."
13931,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I think I would have remembered that.
13932,OBERYN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you."
13933,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
13934,OBERYN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy."
13935,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, That would have made things so much easier.
13936,OBERYN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."""
13937,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
13938,OBERYN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
13939,TYRION,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
13940,OBERYN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I disagree.
13941,OBERYN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion."
13942,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Hello, Robin."
13943,ROBIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, What are you doing?
13944,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time."
13945,ROBIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Why did you leave?
13946,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, It's a long story.
13947,ROBIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
13948,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Yes, you certainly are."
13949,ROBIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, When will you go back?
13950,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
13951,ROBIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
13952,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."
13953,ROBIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?
13954,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, We don't.
13955,ROBIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?
13956,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
13957,ROBIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door."
13958,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I like the sound of that.
13959,ROBIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
13960,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, All right.
13961,ROBIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, It can go in here in this big tower.
13962,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
13963,ROBIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I didn't ruin it.
13964,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You did.
13965,ROBIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it.
13966,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.
13967,ROBIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,  I didn't ruin it!
13968,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You're being stupid.
13969,ROBIN,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,  I didn't ruin it!
13970,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Robin, I'm sorry, I-"
13971,LITTLEFINGER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Children.
13972,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I hit him.
13973,LITTLEFINGER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Yes, I saw."
13974,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I shouldn't have done that.
13975,LITTLEFINGER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction."
13976,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, If he tells Aunt Lysa...
13977,LITTLEFINGER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
13978,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.
13979,LITTLEFINGER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one."
13980,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.
13981,LITTLEFINGER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world."
13982,LITTLEFINGER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You're more beautiful than she ever was.
13983,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Lord Baelish...
13984,LITTLEFINGER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Call me Petyr.
13985,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?"
13986,LYSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Come here, Sansa."
13987,LYSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Do you know how far the fall is?
13988,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, No.
13989,LYSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Neither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did."
13990,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen-"
13991,LYSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Don't be coy with me, you little whore. You kissed him. You kissed Petyr."
13992,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I didn't. You don't understand.
13993,LYSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, I saw you! You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.
13994,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87,  He kissed me. I pulled away.
13995,LYSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Liar! Whore! He is mine!
13996,SANSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Please!
13997,LYSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me. Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down!"
13998,LITTLEFINGER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Lysa! Let her go.
13999,LYSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, You want her? This empty-headed child?
14000,LITTLEFINGER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, Let her go.
14001,LYSA,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87, She's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why?
14002,LITTLEFINGER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa."
14003,LITTLEFINGER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife."
14004,LITTLEFINGER,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_87," I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister."
14005,MAN 1,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_88, Here we are.
14006,MAN 2,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_88, The Rains of Castamere!
14007,MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_88," You fucking dick! Same wrong guess every fucking time. Listen, ya cunt."
14008,MAN 3,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_88," Oh, The Bear and the Maiden Fair!"
14009,MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_88," There's a man with an ear. Too bad you've got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your britches down, I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?"
14010,GILLY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_88, Yes.
14011,MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_88," Well, what are you going to say?"
14012,GILLY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_88, I'm sorry it woke you up.
14013,MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_88," I don't care if you're sorry. Keep that baby quiet, or I will."
14014,GILLY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_88, Don't you ever touch him.
14015,MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_88," Hehehe, little Wildling bitch. You should've stayed with your own kind. *an owl hoots in the distance* Are you listening to me?"
14016,GILLY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_88, Shut your mouth.
14017,MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_88, What? It's just an owl you dumb bitch.
14018,GILLY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_88, No it's not.
14019,SAM,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5, I should never have left her there.
14020,JON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5, You couldn't have known.
14021,SAM,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5, Of course I could've known. They were raiding the villages close by.
14022,GRENN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5, And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers?
14023,ED,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5, Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.
14024,GRENN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5," Oh, so it's alright then?! Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!"
14025,ED,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5, I didn't say it was alright! I'm sayin' they shouldn't have been there.
14026,GRENN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5, We pledged to guard the realms of men.
14027,SAM,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5, She's dead because of me.
14028,GRENN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5, We can't even guard Mole's Town.
14029,JON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5," We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want."
14030,SAM,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5, Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.
14031,PYP,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5," Maybe she managed to hide herself. I thought one of you was dead, you went North with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did."
14032,ED,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5, She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met. She survived the long march to the wall. She survived a white walker for fuck's sake. She might've got out.
14033,SAM,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5, She might have.
14034,JON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5," If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close."
14035,ED,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5, A hundred thousand.
14036,GRENN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5," And there's what, 5 of us left."
14037,ED,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5," If you're counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully. A hundred and two."
14038,PYP,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5, How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?
14039,ED,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5," Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back."
14040,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, You think he was spying on you?
14041,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1," No, not spying."
14042,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.
14043,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, Yes your grace.
14044,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, But you are not Dothraki.
14045,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, No.
14046,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1," Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes."
14047,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, He was interested.
14048,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, What?
14049,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, I believe he was interested.
14050,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1," When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?"
14051,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, All of it?
14052,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, The...the pillar an the stones.
14053,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1," I don't know, your grace."
14054,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, Haven't you ever wondered?
14055,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1," Yes, your grace."
14056,GREY WORM,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.
14057,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, *in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.
14058,GREY WORM,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, *in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.
14059,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, *in Valyrian* No.
14060,GREY WORM,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1," The lessons you give I in Common tongue, these are precious to I."
14061,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, To me.
14062,GREY WORM,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, To me.
14063,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, I don't remember teaching you the word precious.
14064,GREY WORM,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1," Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word."
14065,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, Do you remember the name you were given at birth?
14066,GREY WORM,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, I remember nothing. Only unsullied.
14067,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1," When they cut you, do you remember that?"
14068,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.
14069,GREY WORM,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, Why? Why sorry?
14070,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
14071,GREY WORM,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1," *approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry."
14072,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, *in Valyrian* Grey Worm.
14073,MISSANDEI,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, *in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.
14074,GREY WORM,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1, *in Valyrian* So am I.
14075,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1," Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?"
14076,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1," I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands."
14077,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, And what are you really?
14078,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, I'm Reek.
14079,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1," Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud."
14080,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, I'm Reek.
14081,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, Until when?
14082,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, Always. Forever.
14083,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
14084,GUARD 1,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, *to Theon* No closer. Who are you?
14085,RALF,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1," I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?"
14086,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, Yes.
14087,RALF,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, And why should I believe that?
14088,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
14089,EVERYONE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, What is dead may never die.
14090,RALF,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1," And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?"
14091,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
14092,RALF,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, And what does Lord Bolton want?
14093,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
14094,RALF,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, He wants us to surrender?
14095,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1," My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you."
14096,RALF,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, ...shame fought with honor.
14097,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1," I'm sorry, I didn't hear..."
14098,RALF,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?
14099,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, *scared* You don't know.
14100,RALF,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, The Ironborn will not surrender.
14101,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, *whispering* Reek. Reek.
14102,RALF,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1," You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?"
14103,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, Reek.
14104,MAN 4,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1," If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?"
14105,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
14106,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1," You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?"
14107,THEON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
14108,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1, I believe we will. To our new home.
14109,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally."
14110,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
14111,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce."
14112,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black."
14113,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, My lord...
14114,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn..."
14115,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
14116,LADY ANYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair."
14117,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
14118,LADY ANYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
14119,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door."
14120,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
14121,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, We were told there was a witness. A girl.
14122,LADY ANYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," A niece of yours, I believe."
14123,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help."
14124,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, We'd like to speak with her.
14125,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, Let me fetch her.
14126,LADY ANYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
14127,LADY ANYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room."
14128,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, My lady...
14129,LADY ANYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, I wasn't asking you.
14130,SANSA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, He can stay.
14131,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw."
14132,SANSA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," *to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
14133,LADY ANYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Please, Alayne, leave nothing out."
14134,SANSA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
14135,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?"
14136,SANSA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."
14137,SER VANCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Your secret is safe with us, my lady."
14138,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
14139,LADY ANYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa."
14140,SANSA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
14141,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, Lady Sansa.
14142,SANSA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
14143,LADY ANYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault."
14144,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
14145,LADY ANYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
14146,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly."
14147,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same."
14148,LADY ANYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?"
14149,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl."
14150,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, Are you questioning our courage?
14151,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?"
14152,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
14153,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?"
14154,LADY ANYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead."
14155,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale."
14156,LADY ANYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
14157,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
14158,LADY ANYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1, More often they die young.
14159,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse."
14160,LORD ROYCE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Aye, it's time."
14161,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1," Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest."
14162,BOY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Ser Barristan.
14163,SER BARRISTAN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Yes? Who sent you?
14164,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Ser Barristan.
14165,SER BARRISTAN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Ser Jorah.
14166,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Have I forgotten a council meeting?
14167,SER BARRISTAN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, No.
14168,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, What's this?
14169,SER BARRISTAN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.
14170,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Who gave you this?
14171,SER BARRISTAN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Does it matter?
14172,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Have you told her?
14173,SER BARRISTAN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3," I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back."
14174,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Let me speak with her in private.
14175,SER BARRISTAN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, You'll never be alone with her again.
14176,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Why did the usurper pardon you?
14177,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, If we could speak alone.
14178,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3," No, speak to me here. Explain it to me."
14179,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3," Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him."
14180,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
14181,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, It is not forged.
14182,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3," Why, then?"
14183,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3," I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing."
14184,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, What was the content of these letters?
14185,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Information.
14186,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, What information?
14187,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
14188,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
14189,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, I...
14190,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Yes or no?
14191,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Khaleesi.
14192,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
14193,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Yes.
14194,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
14195,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, I stopped you from drinking his wine.
14196,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, Because you knew it was poisoned.
14197,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, I suspected.
14198,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, You betrayed me from the first.
14199,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3," Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me."
14200,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
14201,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.
14202,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, ...and you want me to forgive you?
14203,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3, I have loved you.
14204,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3," Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can."
14205,SER JORAH,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3," Daenerys, please."
14206,DANY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3," Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now."
14207,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3," Moat Cailin is yours, Father."
14208,LORD BOLTON,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3, Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?
14209,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3, No.
14210,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3," Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see."
14211,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3," Moors, fields, hills."
14212,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3, Tell me what you see.
14213,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3, Nothing.
14214,ROOSE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3," Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?"
14215,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3, Ramsay Snow.
14216,ROOSE,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3," No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North."
14217,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3," You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise."
14218,RAMSAY,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3," Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath."
14219,SANSA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3, Yes?
14220,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3," First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?"
14221,SANSA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3, They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
14222,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3, That's not an answer.
14223,SANSA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3," If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?"
14224,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3, I don't know.
14225,SANSA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3, Neither do I.
14226,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3, Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?
14227,SANSA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3, I know what you want.
14228,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3, Do you?
14229,HOUND,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1," I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy."
14230,ARYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, Lots of things make me happy.
14231,HOUND,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, Like what?
14232,ARYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1," Killing Polliver, killing Rorge."
14233,HOUND,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?
14234,ARYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
14235,HOUND,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1," Aye, nothing in the world beats that look."
14236,ARYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
14237,HOUND,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1," I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel."
14238,ARYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
14239,HOUND,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, *laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*
14240,ARYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, You should have let me burn it.
14241,HOUND,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, It's a fleabite.
14242,ARYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
14243,HOUND,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1," Well, we won't have to walk too much further."
14244,ARYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, You really think my aunt will pay for me?
14245,HOUND,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1," Aye, she'll pay."
14246,ARYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, I've never even met her.
14247,HOUND,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1," Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about."
14248,ARYA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, I'm not a lady.
14249,GUARD,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
14250,HOUND,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1," The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn."
14251,GUARD,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1, Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.
14252,ROBIN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_5," I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave."
14253,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_5, You shouldn't be.
14254,ROBIN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_5," The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside."
14255,PETYR,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_5, It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
14256,SANSA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_5, Shall we go?
14257,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
14258,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Soon.
14259,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25," Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
14260,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, I've never seen him fight.
14261,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25," Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
14262,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Oberyn believes in himself.
14263,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
14264,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Beheading.
14265,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25," Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
14266,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Cousins.
14267,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25," Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
14268,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
14269,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
14270,TOGETHER,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!
14271,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Nothing made him happier.
14272,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
14273,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
14274,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25," The joke wore thin, though."
14275,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, For you. You drifted away.
14276,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, I had other interests.
14277,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25," Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
14278,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Why?
14279,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25," I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
14280,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
14281,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25," Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
14282,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25," Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
14283,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25," I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
14284,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, He was twice your size.
14285,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25," He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
14286,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, I don't know.
14287,JAIME,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Good luck today.
14288,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Looks like very light armor.
14289,OBERYN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, I like to move around.
14290,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
14291,OBERYN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
14292,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
14293,OBERYN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Today is not the day I die.
14294,ELLARIA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, You're going to fight that?
14295,OBERYN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, I'm going to kill that.
14296,ELLARIA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, He is the biggest man I've ever seen.
14297,OBERYN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
14298,TYRION,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Thank the gods.
14299,PYCELL,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25," In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion..."
14300,ELLARIA,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Don't leave me alone in this world.
14301,OBERYN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Never.
14302,OBERYN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Have they told you who I am?
14303,MOUNTAIN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Some dead man.
14304,OBERYN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
14305,OBERYN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
14306,OBERYN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
14307,OBERYN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
14308,OBERYN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, You raped her! You murdered her!
14309,OBERYN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, You killed her children!
14310,OBERYN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25," Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!"
14311,MOUNTAIN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25, Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!
14312,TYWEN,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25," *standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death.1Embed"
14313,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, What was she like?
14314,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, She...she had red hair.
14315,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Oh? How big were her feet?
14316,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Well what do you want me to say?
14317,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
14318,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, So you and Gilly never-
14319,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
14320,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," But if she had, you would've? You'd have broken your vows?"
14321,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women."
14322,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, What?
14323,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," ""I shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation."
14324,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
14325,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?"
14326,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
14327,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," No, you're really not."
14328,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
14329,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
14330,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, There will.
14331,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
14332,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch."
14333,TORMUND,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?
14334,YGRITTE,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Yes.
14335,TORMUND,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--"
14336,YGRITTE,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.
14337,TORMUND,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, We could be waiting here a while.
14338,YGRITTE,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting."
14339,STYR,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.
14340,YGRITTE,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon."
14341,STYR,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.
14342,YGRITTE,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I probably killed him already.
14343,STYR,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, So you've said.
14344,YGRITTE,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
14345,STYR,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
14346,YGRITTE,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?"
14347,STYR,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Maybe I have.
14348,YGRITTE,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me."
14349,AEMON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?"
14350,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Maester Aemon. How did you know-
14351,AEMON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
14352,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Let me help you.
14353,AEMON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?"
14354,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Maester Faull
14355,AEMON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library."
14356,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
14357,AEMON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
14358,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I don't love her.
14359,AEMON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Yes you do.
14360,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, No.
14361,AEMON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.
14362,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, You were?
14363,AEMON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?"
14364,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that."
14365,AEMON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, You know who I was before I came here? What I could've been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.
14366,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Who was she?
14367,AEMON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.
14368,PYP,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!"
14369,GILLY,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!"
14370,PYP,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," I'm sorry, I can't."
14371,GILLY,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do."
14372,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Pyp! Open the gate.
14373,PYP,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I can't.
14374,GILLY,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Sam, is that you?!"
14375,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Yes!
14376,PYP,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
14377,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!"
14378,PYP,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I've never heard you curse before.
14379,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Yes, well, best get used to it."
14380,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella."
14381,GILLY,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, It was horrible.
14382,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.
14383,GILLY,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Don't let them send me away, Sam."
14384,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Never.
14385,GILLY,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I know there's no women allowed.
14386,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too."
14387,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Get ready!
14388,THENN WARG,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, It's time.
14389,JANOS,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Pick up the pace!
14390,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser."
14391,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, A hundred thousand you say?
14392,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Yes sir.
14393,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, You can say it if you like. We should've sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.
14394,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," It was a difficult decision either way, Ser."
14395,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job."
14396,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
14397,GILLY,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, You're leaving me again?
14398,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I'm not leaving you!
14399,GILLY,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.
14400,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I...I didn't mean in the same room.
14401,GILLY,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, What are you going to do out there?
14402,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Help my brothers.
14403,GILLY,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.
14404,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
14405,GILLY,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here."
14406,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do."
14407,GILLY,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Promise me you won't die.
14408,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I promise you I won't die.
14409,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.
14410,PYP,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?
14411,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us."
14412,PYP,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?"
14413,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid."
14414,PYP,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, But you're afraid now?
14415,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore."
14416,YGRITTE,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
14417,STYR,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, How high are the walls?
14418,YGRITTE,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened."
14419,TORMUND,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Let's kill some Crows!
14420,TORMUND,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, *yells* Come on! *puts out the fire*
14421,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Archers knock, everyone else hold."
14422,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!
14423,NIGHT'S WATCH,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, No Ser!
14424,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!
14425,NIGHT'S WATCH,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, No Ser!
14426,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, You all plan to die here tonight?
14427,NIGHT'S WATCH,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, No Ser!
14428,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, That's very good to hear. Draw!
14429,MEMBER 1,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Help, down below."
14430,JANOS,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, They're attacking the southern gates!
14431,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Now?
14432,JANOS,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Now!
14433,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," I'm going down then. Brother Slynt, you have The Wall."
14434,JANOS,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, What?!
14435,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," What are you fucking waiting for, loose!"
14436,JANOS,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, You heard the man. Loose!
14437,TORMUND,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," You, over there."
14438,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Did you get one?
14439,PYP,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," No. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam."
14440,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Yeah?
14441,PYP,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I think we're gonna die.
14442,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, If you keep missing we will.
14443,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?
14444,NIGHT'S WATCH,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, No!
14445,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you, Castle Black will stand."
14446,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, The Night's Watch will stand.
14447,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," With me now! Now, with me!"
14448,JANOS,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders."
14449,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, We can't just let them attack the gate!
14450,JANOS,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," The bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel."
14451,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?"
14452,JANOS,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.
14453,GRENN,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, he said he needs ya."
14454,JANOS,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Needed below? Yes. Yes.
14455,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!
14456,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, They won't summit before dawn.
14457,GRENN,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, How do you know that?
14458,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Because I've made that claim.
14459,ED,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.
14460,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Knock! Draw! Loose!
14461,PYP,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," I got one. Right through the heart, he's dead."
14462,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Oh, is it over?"
14463,PYP,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Huh?
14464,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*
14465,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright."
14466,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Now!
14467,ED,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Now!
14468,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," *to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate."
14469,GRENN,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Alright.
14470,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, *grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...
14471,GRENN,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," They won't. Come on Hill! And you Cooper! You three, on me! Come on you lazy bastards!"
14472,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Oil!
14473,ED,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Oil on the ramp!
14474,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Protect the gate!
14475,ALLISER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Hold the fucking gate! Hold it!
14476,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, *to Grenn* We need more men down here.
14477,GRENN,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, We have to hold the gate.
14478,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, But we need men here.
14479,GRENN,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Tell Jon! He's in command. *to the men behind him* Let's go!
14480,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, *to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!
14481,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?"
14482,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!"
14483,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, What are you doing up here?
14484,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.
14485,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them."
14486,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Two brothers now fight with me.
14487,ED,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Might as well enjoy our last night, right boys? Light the fuckers up. Knock! Draw! Loose!"
14488,DONNEL,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, How are we gonna stop that?
14489,COOPER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, We shot twenty-eight arrows in him already.
14490,GRENN,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," You heard Jon, we hold the gate."
14491,DONNEL,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.
14492,GRENN,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, We hold the gate!
14493,DONNEL,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Mother save me. Father save me.
14494,GRENN,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us, you hear me?"
14495,DONNEL,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," No, please."
14496,GRENN,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns"
14497,ALL TOGETHER,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," And win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come!"
14498,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, *to Sam* I don't want you out there.
14499,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
14500,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I need him more than I need you.
14501,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, We need you boy.
14502,YGRITTE,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Jon Snow.
14503,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," No, shh, don't talk."
14504,YGRITTE,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Do you remember that cave?
14505,YGRITTE,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, We should've stayed in that cave.
14506,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, We'll go back there.
14507,YGRITTE,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," You know nothing, Jon Snow."
14508,ED,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Drop the scythe, boys!"
14509,ED,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Hoister up!
14510,ED,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, They've had enough for one night.
14511,ED,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Don't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us a thousand to one.
14512,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Tormund. It's over, let it end."
14513,TORMUND,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, This is how a man ends.
14514,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Put him in chains. We'll question him later.
14515,TORMUND,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I should've thrown you from the top of your wall boy!
14516,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Aye, you should've."
14517,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?"
14518,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, We held them off.
14519,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, For one night.
14520,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, This is a great victory.
14521,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them."
14522,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Where are you going?
14523,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I'm going to find Mance.
14524,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.
14525,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home."
14526,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Without Mance? You're going to kill him?
14527,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I'm going to try.
14528,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him."
14529,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
14530,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!
14531,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?
14532,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89," They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out."
14533,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, What are you doing?
14534,JON,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
14535,SAM,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_89, Jon. Come back.
14536,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, You're wearing a black cloak again.
14537,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, I've been sent to negotiate with you.
14538,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was."
14539,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows."
14540,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?"
14541,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
14542,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Did you see her again at Castle Black?
14543,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Yes.
14544,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, And?
14545,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, She's dead.
14546,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Your doing?
14547,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, No.
14548,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, We'll drink to her.
14549,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last."
14550,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Ygritte.
14551,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Ygritte.
14552,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, That's not wine.
14553,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty."
14554,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
14555,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
14556,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Grenn came from a farm.
14557,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Mag and Grenn.
14558,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Grenn and Mag.
14559,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?"
14560,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Turn your army around and go home.
14561,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?
14562,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
14563,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black."
14564,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?"
14565,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, You attacking us?
14566,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," No, it's like you said, we don't have the men."
14567,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Hold! To me. To me.
14568,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.
14569,STANNIS,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, You're the king beyond the wall?
14570,STANNIS,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, You know who I am?
14571,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Never had the pleasure.
14572,DAVOS,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms."
14573,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.
14574,STANNIS,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
14575,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, We do not kneel.
14576,STANNIS,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king."
14577,MANCE,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," All the same, we do not kneel."
14578,STANNIS,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Take these men away.
14579,DAVOS,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?
14580,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
14581,DAVOS,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.
14582,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son."
14583,STANNIS,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Your father was an honorable man.
14584,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," He was, your grace."
14585,STANNIS,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, What do you think he'd have done with him?
14586,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," I was this man's prisoner once. He could've tortured me, he could've killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father would've taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
14587,STANNIS,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90, Very well. *to Davos* Take him.
14588,JON,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_90," Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them."
14589,PYCELLE,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.
14590,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Bloody Martells.
14591,PYCELLE,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, The cause appears to be manticore venom.
14592,QYBURN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," It is, yes, manticore."
14593,PYCELLE,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done."
14594,QYBURN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Yes there is.
14595,PYCELLE,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, May I ask what you think you're doing?
14596,QYBURN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Saving him.
14597,PYCELLE,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester."
14598,QYBURN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.
14599,PYCELLE,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion."
14600,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," You're dismissed, Grand Maester."
14601,PYCELLE,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Your grace. This is my laboratory!
14602,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Not anymore.
14603,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, You can save him?
14604,QYBURN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance."
14605,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.
14606,QYBURN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," Thank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat."
14607,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Will it weaken him?
14608,QYBURN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Oh no.
14609,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Very well then.
14610,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed."
14611,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, I'm opening it again.
14612,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
14613,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, I will not.
14614,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was."
14615,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king."
14616,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-"
14617,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.
14618,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?
14619,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away."
14620,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, No.
14621,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen."
14622,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, And how will you do that?
14623,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, I'll tell everyone the truth.
14624,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, And what truth would that be?
14625,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you would've known."
14626,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Known what?
14627,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.
14628,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," No, no, no, no, no."
14629,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Your legacy is a lie.
14630,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, I don't believe you.
14631,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Yes you do.
14632,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Jaime.
14633,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?"
14634,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine."
14635,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Tyrion is your family.
14636,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, He's not.
14637,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, You don't get to choose.
14638,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-"
14639,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
14640,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?"
14641,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-"
14642,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, I choose you.
14643,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Those are words.
14644,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.
14645,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Told him what?
14646,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, I told him about us.
14647,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, You told him?
14648,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you."
14649,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, You think he'll just accept that?
14650,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Go and ask him.
14651,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, What did you say?
14652,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27," I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters."
14653,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, Someone will walk in.
14654,CERSEI,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27, I don't care.
14655,MISSANDEI,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," *in Valyrian* You stand before Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Mereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men. Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons."
14656,FENNESZ,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," *in Valyrian* Thank you for seeing me, your grace. My name is Fennesz. I can speak the common tongue if you wish."
14657,DAENERYS,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, You speak it very well.
14658,FENNESZ,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much."
14659,DAENERYS,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?
14660,FENNESZ,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets."
14661,DAENERYS,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
14662,FENNESZ,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," I do not mean to offend, your grace. I went to one of these places. The young prey on the old. Take what they want and beat us if we resist."
14663,DAENERYS,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you."
14664,FENNESZ,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children."
14665,DAENERYS,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, What is it that you want from me?
14666,FENNESZ,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal."
14667,DAENERYS,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?"
14668,FENNESZ,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-"
14669,DAENERYS,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
14670,FENNESZ,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," Thank you, your grace. Thank you."
14671,BARRISTAN,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.
14672,DAENERYS,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, Approach my friend.
14673,MAN,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," *in Low Valyrian* I do not understand, my queen. I do not understand, my queen."
14674,MISSANDEI,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, *in Low Valyrian* The Queen says you may approach.
14675,MAN,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," *crying, speaking Low Valyrian*"
14676,MISSANDEI,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, *translating* I have brought you. He came from the sky. The black one. The winged shadow. He came from the sky and...
14677,MISSANDEI,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, *translating* My girl. My little girl.
14678,DAENERYS,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, What was her name?
14679,MISSANDEI,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," Zala, your grace."
14680,DAENERYS,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, How old was she?
14681,MISSANDEI,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, Three.
14682,DAENERYS,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon?
14683,GREY WORM,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1," *in Valyrian* Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago, my queen. Nothing since then."
14684,DAENERYS,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1, *in Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs.
14685,AEMON,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7," They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west. They died protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names. It is for us to remember them. Our brothers, we shall never see their like again."
14686,ALL TOGETHER,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, And now their watch is ended.
14687,AEMON,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, And now their watch is ended.
14688,TORMUND,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, Your old blind man patched me up. Why?
14689,JON,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7," He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe."
14690,TORMUND,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, You want me alive so you can torture me?
14691,JON,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, No one's going to torture you.
14692,TORMUND,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?
14693,JON,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, I don't know what happens to the prisoners.
14694,TORMUND,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, Who decides?
14695,JON,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, I suppose Stannis does.
14696,TORMUND,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, He your king now?
14697,JON,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, I don't have a king.
14698,TORMUND,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7," You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow. You can never be a kneeler again."
14699,JON,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?
14700,TORMUND,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, Words? What kind of words?
14701,JON,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.
14702,TORMUND,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, Do what?
14703,JON,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, Say farewell.
14704,TORMUND,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7," The dead can't hear us, boy."
14705,TORMUND,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, Snow. Did you love her? She loved you.
14706,JON,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, She told you?
14707,TORMUND,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7, No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That's how I know. She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me?
14708,MEERA,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9," We can stop, we can rest."
14709,JOJEN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, We'll rest with the three-eyed raven.
14710,MEERA,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, We're not going to make it.
14711,JOJEN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, We're already here.
14712,BRAN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9," Jojen. Jojen! Look, Jojen, look."
14713,MEERA,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, JOJEN! Hold on!
14714,BRAN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, Help them! Now!
14715,MEERA,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, Hold on to me!
14716,HODOR,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, Hodor...
14717,BRAN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, Help them!
14718,JOJEN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9," Bran! Save yourself, now!"
14719,GIRL,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9," Come with me, Brandon Stark!"
14720,GIRL,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9," He is lost. Come with me, or die with him."
14721,[JOJEN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, Go with them.
14722,GIRL,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, They cannot follow us. The power that moves them is powerless here.
14723,BRAN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, Who are you?
14724,GIRL,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9," The First Men called us The Children, but we were born long before them. Come, he waits for you."
14725,BRAN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, You’re the three-eyed raven.
14726,OLD MAN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9," I have been many things. Now, I am what you see."
14727,MEERA,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9," My brother, he led us to you, and now he…"
14728,OLD MAN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9," He knew what would happen. From the moment he left, he knew, and he went anyway."
14729,MEERA,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, How do you know?
14730,OLD MAN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9," I’ve been watching you. All of you, all of your lives, with a thousand eyes and one. Now you’ve come to me at last, Brandon Stark, though the hour is late."
14731,BRAN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, I didn’t want anyone to die for me.
14732,OLD MAN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, He died so that you could find what you have lost.
14733,BRAN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, You’re going to help me walk again?
14734,OLD MAN,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_9, You’ll never walk again. But you will fly.
14735,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Podrick. Podrick! Where are the horses?
14736,PODRICK,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, I hobbled them last night.
14737,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, What sort of hobble?
14738,PODRICK,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7," A figure-eight, like you taught me."
14739,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, If you did it like I taught you then the horses would be here.
14740,PODRICK,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7," Thieves, maybe?"
14741,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, It’s at least thirty miles to the Eyrie from here. You’re carrying the saddle bags.
14742,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7," People coming. You can shit later, there’s people coming!"
14743,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Morning!
14744,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Morning.
14745,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, I like your sword. Are we getting close to the bloody gate?
14746,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, About ten more miles.
14747,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Did you hear that Podrick? Only about ten more miles to the Bloody Gate.
14748,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Are you a knight?
14749,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, No.
14750,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, But you know how to use that sword.
14751,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, I do.
14752,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Does it have a name?
14753,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, “Oathkeeper.”
14754,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Mine’s “Needle.”
14755,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Good name.
14756,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Who taught you how to fight?
14757,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, My father.
14758,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Mine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys.
14759,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7," Mine said the same. But I kept fighting the boys anyway. Kept losing. Finally my father said, “If you’re going to do it, you might as well do it right.”"
14760,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7," Seven blessings. I’m Brienne of Tarth, this is Podrick Payne."
14761,HOUND,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, You want something?
14762,PODRICK,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, That’s Sandor Clegane- the Hound.
14763,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, You’re Arya Stark.
14764,HOUND,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, I asked if you wanted something.
14765,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.
14766,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, My mother’s dead.
14767,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, I know. I wish I could’ve been there to protect her.
14768,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, You’re not a northerner.
14769,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7," I know, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her."
14770,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Why didn’t you?
14771,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King’s Landing.
14772,HOUND,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, You’re paid by the Lannisters. You’re here for the bounty on me.
14773,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, I’m not paid by the Lannisters.
14774,HOUND,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7," No? Fancy sword you’ve got there. Where’d you get it? I’ve been looking at Lannister gold all my life. Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth, tell me that’s not Lannister gold."
14775,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.
14776,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, The Bloody Gate’s ten miles.
14777,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, I swore to your mother by the Old Gods and the New -
14778,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, I don’t care what you swore!
14779,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Arya!
14780,HOUND,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, You heard the girl! She’s not coming with you.
14781,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, She is.
14782,HOUND,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, You’re not a good listener. Valyrian steel-- I’ve always wanted some Valyrian steel.
14783,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Come with me Arya. I’ll take you to safety.
14784,HOUND,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7," Safety?! Where the fuck’s that? Her aunt in the Eyrie’s dead. Her mother’s dead, her father’s dead, her brother’s dead. Winterfell’s a pile of rubble. There’s no safety, you dumb bitch. If you don’t know that by now, you’re the wrong one to watch over her."
14785,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, And that’s what you’re doing? Watching over her?
14786,HOUND,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7," Aye, that’s what I’m doing."
14787,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, I have no wish to kill you Ser.
14788,HOUND,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, I’m not a knight.
14789,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Arya! Arya! ARYA! Where is she?
14790,PODRICK,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, She was just here...
14791,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Why weren’t you watching her?
14792,PODRICK,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, I was watching you I thought you migth need some help…
14793,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Which way Pod? Which way did she go?
14794,PODRICK,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7," Ah, I think that way."
14795,BRIENNE,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Arya!
14796,HOUND,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, You’re still here? [Coughs] Big bitch saved you.
14797,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, I don’t need saving.
14798,HOUND,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7," No, not you. You’re a real killer. With your water dancing, and your needle."
14799,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, You’re gonna die?
14800,HOUND,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7," Unless there’s a Maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I’m done. I’d skin you alive for wine. [Arya offers water.] Fuck water! Killed by a woman. (Chuckles) I bet you liked that. Go on, go after her. She’ll help you. Going out alone, you won’t last a day out there."
14801,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, I’ll last longer than you.
14802,HOUND,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7," You remember where the heart is? Fuck it. I’m ready. Go on, girl. Another name off your list. You kept promising me. I cut down your butcher’s boy, the ginger. He was begging for mercy. Please sir, please don’t kill me, please, please. Bled all over my horse. Saddle stunk of butcher’s boy for weeks. And your sister, your pretty sister. I should’ve taken her. That night the Blackwater burned, I should’ve fucked her bloody. At least I’d have one happy memory! Do I have to beg you? Do it. Do it."
14803,HOUND,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7, Kill me. Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!
14804,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29," Oh, get on with it you son of a whore."
14805,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, Is that any way to speak about our mother?
14806,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, What’re you doing?
14807,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, What do you think I’m doing? The galley’s waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.
14808,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, Who’s helping you?
14809,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, Varys.
14810,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, Varys?
14811,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, You have more friends than you thought.
14812,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29," There’s a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open."
14813,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29," I suppose this is goodbye, then."
14814,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29," Farewell, little brother."
14815,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29," Jaime, thank you. For my life."
14816,JAIME,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, Quickly now.
14817,WOMAN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, Tywin… my lion...
14818,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
14819,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29," Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we’ll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure…"
14820,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29," All my life, you’ve wanted me dead."
14821,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29," Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what’s yours. I’d never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I’d never let Illyn Payne take your head. You’re a Lannister. You’re my son."
14822,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, I loved her.
14823,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, Who?
14824,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, Shae.
14825,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29," Bah, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow."
14826,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, I murdered her. With my own hands.
14827,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, It doesn’t matter.
14828,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, It doesn’t matter?
14829,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, She was a whore!
14830,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, Say that word again.
14831,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, And what? You’ll kill your own father in the privy? No. You’re my son. Enough of this nonsense…
14832,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29," I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn’t poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?"
14833,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, Enough. We’ll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.
14834,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, I can’t go back there. She’s in there.
14835,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29," What, are you afraid of a dead whore?"
14836,TYWIN,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, You shot me. You’re no son of mine.
14837,TYRION,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29, I am your son. I have always been your son.
14838,VARYS,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29," What have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend, I’ve brought you this far."
14839,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9, I want to see the captain.
14840,CAPTAIN,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9, You’re seeing him.
14841,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9," I want to go north, to the wall."
14842,CAPTAIN,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9, No you don’t.
14843,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9, I can pay.
14844,CAPTAIN,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9, There is nothing in the north but ice and war and pirates.
14845,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9," I wouldn’t need a cabin. Please, I could work, scrubbing the floors, or…"
14846,CAPTAIN,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9," I’m not going north, child, we’re going home."
14847,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9, Where’s home?
14848,CAPTAIN,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9, The Free City of Braavos.
14849,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9," Wait, I have something else."
14850,CAPTAIN,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9, More silver won’t make a difference.
14851,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9," It’s not silver, it’s iron."
14852,ARYA,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9, Valar morghulis.
14853,CAPTAIN,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9," How did you… valar dohaeris. Of course, you shall have a cabin."
14854,MELARA,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, We shouldn’t be out here alone.
14855,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, Why not?
14856,MELARA,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, If your father hears…
14857,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, He’ll never know we’ve been gone.
14858,MELARA,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, But if he finds out…
14859,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, You don’t need to be afraid of my father.
14860,MELARA,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, Are you sure?
14861,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, Yes.
14862,MELARA,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, We shouldn’t go in.
14863,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, Of course we should.
14864,MAGGY,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, Get out. Get out!
14865,MELARA,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, Let’s go…
14866,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, No.
14867,MAGGY,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, Listen to your friend.
14868,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, They said that you were terrifying. With cat’s teeth and three eyes. You’re not terrifying. You’re boring.
14869,MAGGY,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, You don’t know what I am.
14870,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, I know you’re a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.
14871,MAGGY,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, Everybody wants to know their future. Until they know their future.
14872,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, This is my father’s land. My land. Tell me my future or I’ll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.
14873,MAGGY,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, Your blood. Give me a taste.
14874,MAGGY,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, Three questions you get. You won’t like the answers.
14875,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, I’ve been promised to the prince. When will we marry?
14876,MAGGY,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, You’ll never wed the prince. You’ll wed the king.
14877,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, But I will be queen?
14878,MAGGY,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91," Oh yes, you’ll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear."
14879,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, Will the king and I have children?
14880,MAGGY,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91," No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3."
14881,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, That doesn’t make sense.
14882,MAGGY,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91, Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.
14883,MELARA,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_91," Come on, we have to go. We have to go! Cersei!"
14884,PRIEST,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1," Your grace, we are honored by your presence. The mourners are waiting."
14885,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.
14886,PRIEST,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1," But your grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here…"
14887,PRIEST,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, From all seven kingdoms…
14888,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, They will wait.
14889,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1," He never wanted you to be a King’s Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body."
14890,JAIME,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1," What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They’re going to try to take it away, all of it."
14891,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, They?
14892,JAIME,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, All of them out there are enemies. They’re waiting a night to make sure he’s really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they’ll set to work on tearing us apart.
14893,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1," They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he’s the enemy. I’ve been telling you for years, you’ve been defending him for years…"
14894,JAIME,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, This is exactly what they want.
14895,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, ...and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?
14896,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1," Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You’re a man of action, aren’t you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. (gestures towards Tywin) Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world."
14897,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, Apologies.
14898,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, I still don’t see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
14899,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1," I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”."
14900,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, Do you know what it’s like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
14901,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, No. I only know what it’s like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
14902,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, Pentos?
14903,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1," The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself."
14904,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, Much better.
14905,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, My lord?
14906,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, I don’t think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don’t suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
14907,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
14908,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, In a box. Why stop now?
14909,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, Because we are talking about the future of our country.
14910,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1, The future is shit. Just like the past.
14911,PROSTITUTE,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, You want the same? Same as always?
14912,WHITE RAT,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, You… you don’t have to.
14913,PROSTITUTE,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, Habit.
14914,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, Sons of the Harpy?
14915,BARRISTAN,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5," Yes, your grace. They left it on the body."
14916,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, They’ve never killed before.
14917,BARRISTAN,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5," It was only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors are always met with resistance."
14918,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, I didn’t conquer them. Their own people did.
14919,MOSSADOR,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5," They do not see us as people, Your Grace."
14920,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5," Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?"
14921,GREY WORM,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5," White Rat, your grace."
14922,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.
14923,BARRISTAN,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.
14924,MOSSADOR,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, Make them very angry.
14925,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.
14926,MISSANDEI,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, Torgo Nudho.
14927,GREY WORM,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, Missandei hin Naath.
14928,MISSANDEI,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, I wanted to speak with you.
14929,GREY WORM,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, Why do you come?
14930,MISSANDEI,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5," White Rat, the Unsullied who… I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen’s brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?"
14931,GREY WORM,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5, I do not know. I must go.
14932,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, Get your shield up.
14933,OLLY,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, It’s too heavy.
14934,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9," If it wasn’t heavy it wouldn’t stop a sword, now get it up."
14935,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I’ll ring your head like a bell.
14936,GILLY,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9," Shouldn’t you be training, too?"
14937,SAM,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9," Well, I’m hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they’ve killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!"
14938,ALLISER,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, These men need a firm hand. Always have. They’re poachers and thieves.
14939,ALLISER,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, Not soldiers.
14940,GILLY,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, That one hates me.
14941,SAM,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander… he hates the wildlings.
14942,SAM,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, All the wildlings.
14943,GILLY,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, Don’t let them send us away.
14944,SAM,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9," It’s not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he’s a good man. He’s running against Ser Alliser--"
14945,GILLY,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, Sam! Don’t let them send us away.
14946,SAM,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9," I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too."
14947,GILLY,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9," You can’t leave, they’ll execute you."
14948,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9," Good, good, pivot! Don’t forget to pivot! Shield up!"
14949,MELISANDRE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, The king wants a word.
14950,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9," You’re not cold, my lady?"
14951,MELISANDRE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9," Never. The Lord’s fire lives within me, Jon Snow."
14952,MELISANDRE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, Feel.
14953,MELISANDRE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, Are you a virgin?
14954,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, No.
14955,MELISANDRE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, Good.
14956,MELISANDRE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell.
14957,STANNIS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, You know who rules at Winterfell now?
14958,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, Roose Bolton.
14959,STANNIS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark’s heart. Don’t you want to avenge him?
14960,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9," I want a great many things, your grace. But I’m a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch now."
14961,DAVOS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, I’ve been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.
14962,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, They’re good men.
14963,DAVOS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, Many don’t. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?
14964,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, It’s where she belonged.
14965,DAVOS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, Some of the Night’s Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.
14966,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn’t make them monsters.
14967,STANNIS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can’t protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton’s head on a spike. But if I’m to take Winterfell I’ll need more men.
14968,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, The men of the Night’s Watch are sworn to play no part--
14969,STANNIS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, I’m not talking about the damn Night’s Watch. I’m talking about the wildlings.
14970,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9," Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?"
14971,STANNIS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9," If they swear to follow me, I’ll pardon them. We’ll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I’ll declare them citizens of the realm. I’ll give them land to live on."
14972,DAVOS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, It’s a fair offer. More than fair.
14973,STANNIS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, I’ll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
14974,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, I don’t think that’s likely.
14975,STANNIS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9," You admire him, don’t you?"
14976,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, I respect him.
14977,STANNIS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...
14978,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, Your grace…
14979,STANNIS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, ...or he burns.
14980,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9, How much time do I have?
14981,STANNIS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9," Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow."
14982,MASTER OF ARMS,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1," Sword up! Attack, my lord! Attack! Don’t cross your feet!"
14983,YOHN ROYCE,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1, My sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk. This one…
14984,BAELISH,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1, Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.
14985,ROYCE,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1, Great warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy.
14986,SQUIRE,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1, My lord. (hands Baelish a note)
14987,MASTER OF ARMS,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1," Sword up, my lord!"
14988,BAELISH,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1, Some boys develop more slowly. He’s still young.
14989,ROYCE,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1, He’s 13. Boys go to war at 13.
14990,BAELISH,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1, He has other gifts.
14991,ROYCE,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1, Does he?
14992,BAELISH,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1, The gift of a great name. Sometimes that’s all one needs.
14993,SANSA,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1," Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you’ve done for me."
14994,ROYCE,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1," I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady."
14995,BAELISH,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1," I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin’s skills will have improved immeasurably."
14996,ROYCE,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1," He’ll be safe here. As for his skills, I make no promises."
14997,PODRICK,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1," Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We’re a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--"
14998,BRIENNE,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, Us? The only reason you’re here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren’t safe in the capital. You’re hundreds of miles from King’s Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You’re safe.
14999,PODRICK,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, But I’m you’re squire.
15000,BRIENNE,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, Do you even know what a squire is?
15001,PODRICK,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, An attendant to a knight?
15002,BRIENNE,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, I’m not a knight. That means you’re not a squire.
15003,PODRICK,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1," Well, where would I go?"
15004,BRIENNE,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1," I don’t care, I’m not your mother."
15005,PODRICK,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, You swore to find the Stark girls.
15006,BRIENNE,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, I found Arya. She didn’t want my protection.
15007,PODRICK,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, Sansa still might.
15008,BRIENNE,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, Will you shut your mouth? I didn’t ask for advice. I don’t want anyone following me. I’m not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
15009,SANSA,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
15010,BAELISH,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, I did.
15011,SANSA,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, But we’re heading west.
15012,BAELISH,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, We are.
15013,SANSA,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1," If he wanted to betray us, he already would have."
15014,BAELISH,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1," Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he’s not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?"
15015,SANSA,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
15016,BAELISH,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1," No. But I pay them well, and they’ve seen what happens to men who disappoint me."
15017,SANSA,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1, So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?
15018,BAELISH,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1," So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can’t get her hands on you."
15019,LORAS,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11," It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn’t presume to claim to have known him as such…"
15020,LORAS,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a… what a force to be reckoned with.
15021,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, Thank you so much for your kind words.
15022,GRAND MAESTER PYRCELLE,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11," Deepest condolences, your grace. This tragedy… I never trusted Varys. I often warned…"
15023,LANCEL LANNISTER,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, Your grace.
15024,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
15025,LANCEL,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, My deepest sympathies.
15026,KEVAN LANNISTER,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, I apologize for my son’s appearance.
15027,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11," Uncle, it’s quite alright."
15028,KEVAN,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11," They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point… They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive."
15029,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, I’m sure he’ll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.
15030,KEVAN,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, Of course.
15031,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
15032,LANCEL,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, It wasn’t my wounds that needed healing.
15033,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, What can I do for you?
15034,LANCEL,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, You can forgive me.
15035,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
15036,LANCEL,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, I led you into the darkness.
15037,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, I doubt you’ve ever led anyone anywhere.
15038,LANCEL,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11," I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine."
15039,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, I don’t know what you’re talking about.
15040,LANCEL,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11," I’m a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy… or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father’s soul."
15041,CERSEI,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11, The day Tywin Lannister’s soul needs your help…
15042,OLYVAR,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, It looks like Dorne.
15043,LORAS,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, No it doesn’t.
15044,OLYVAR,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, It does. That’s the Sunspear bit right there. And that’s where the mountains are. And over here is… Sunsnake? Stonespear?
15045,LORAS,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, Sandstone.
15046,OLYVAR,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1," Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there."
15047,LORAS,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, Fine.
15048,LORAS,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, It’s Dorne.
15049,OLYVAR,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.
15050,LORAS,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1," Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here."
15051,MARGAERY,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, We’re late for dinner as it is.
15052,LORAS,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, You’re very respectful.
15053,MARGAERY,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, I’m very hungry.
15054,MARGAERY,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, What’s your name?
15055,OLYVAR,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1," Olyvar, my lady."
15056,MARGAERY,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1," I’m afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar."
15057,MARGAERY,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
15058,LORAS,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What’s the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
15059,MARGAERY,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, In any event… (throws Loras his clothes) you shouldn’t keep your intended waiting.
15060,LORAS,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, My intended? Please. Tywin’s dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.
15061,MARGAERY,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, Lucky you.
15062,LORAS,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, Unlucky you.
15063,MARGAERY,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, You think I want that woman married to my brother?
15064,LORAS,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1," If she doesn’t marry me, she doesn’t go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King’s Landing. Which means you’re trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law."
15065,MARGAERY,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, Perhaps.
15066,LORAS,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, Perhaps?
15067,MARGAERY,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1, Perhaps?
15068,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1," Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers."
15069,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1," Imp, half-man."
15070,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, There are faster ways to kill yourself.
15071,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, Not for a coward.
15072,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1," You are many things, my friend, but not a coward."
15073,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, You never told me why you set me free.
15074,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, Your brother asked me to.
15075,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, You could have said no.
15076,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
15077,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1," Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You’re not family, you owe me nothing."
15078,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, I didn’t do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
15079,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
15080,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, I don’t believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
15081,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, You’re going to have to find another soldier. I’m done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
15082,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1," You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
15083,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, I’m not well-suited for work.
15084,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1," I think you are. You have your father’s instinct for politics, and you have compassion."
15085,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
15086,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, I never said you were perfect.
15087,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, What is it you want exactly?
15088,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
15089,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1," Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that’s how they became powerful in the first place."
15090,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1," Perhaps. And perhaps we’ve grown so used to horror we assume there’s no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?"
15091,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
15092,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1," No, you won’t. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name."
15093,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, Good luck finding him.
15094,VARYS,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1," Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio’s palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for."
15095,TYRION,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1, Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
15096,DAARIO NAHARIS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven’t been behaving themselves.
15097,HIZDAHR ZO LORAQ,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7," The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review."
15098,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, Good.
15099,HIZDAHR,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, They did ask for some concessions.
15100,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, Concessions?
15101,HIZDAHR,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7," Politics is the art of compromise, your grace."
15102,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, I’m not a politician. I’m a queen.
15103,HIZDAHR,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7," Forgive me. You’re right, of course. Still, it’s easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones."
15104,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7," I don’t expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery."
15105,HIZDAHR,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.
15106,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
15107,HIZDAHR,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7," In the new world that you’ve brought to us, free men would fight free men."
15108,HIZDAHR,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.
15109,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, No fighting pits.
15110,HIZDAHR,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
15111,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.
15112,HIZDAHR,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, If you--
15113,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, How many times must I say no before you understand?
15114,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, Whatever he wants from me he’s not going to get it. If he really believes I’m going to reopen the fighting pits…
15115,DAARIO,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, You should reopen the fighting pits.
15116,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, What?
15117,DAARIO,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7," My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before."
15118,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, Why?
15119,DAARIO,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7," I was a bad child. I wasn’t big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16."
15120,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7," You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you’re defending the fighting pits?"
15121,DAARIO,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7," I’m only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you."
15122,DAARIO,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7," You’re the queen. Everyone’s too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You’ve made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they’ll attack. Show your strength here, now."
15123,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, That’s why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
15124,DAARIO,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You’re not the Mother of Unsullied. You’re the Mother of Dragons.
15125,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, I don’t want another child’s bones dropped at my feet. No one’s seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he’s flown halfway across the world. I can’t control them anymore.
15126,DAARIO,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.
15127,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, Viserion? Rhaegal?
15128,DAENERYS,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7, Easy. Easy. Easy.
15129,MANCE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, So here we are.
15130,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, Here we are.
15131,MANCE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11," When we first met you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting…"
15132,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, This doesn’t have to be our last meeting.
15133,MANCE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11," No, but it will be."
15134,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, You know what Stannis wants?
15135,MANCE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I’ll give him this much
15136,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, Shouldn’t a king be bold?
15137,MANCE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11," Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he’ll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I’ll never serve him."
15138,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, You told me you weren’t here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.
15139,MANCE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, That’s right. But I don’t want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.
15140,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11," You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life’s work uniting them. You didn’t do it for power. You didn’t do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they’re north of the wall. Isn’t their survival more important than your pride?"
15141,MANCE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn’t about that.
15142,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, Then bend the knee and save your people.
15143,MANCE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that’s all gone.
15144,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won’t go out and rescue them because why? You’re afraid of looking afraid.
15145,MANCE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11," Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?"
15146,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, They’ll burn you alive.
15147,MANCE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11," Bad way to go. I’ll be honest with you, I don’t want to die. And burnt to death, I don’t want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it’s better than betraying everything I believe."
15148,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11," And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they’ll sing songs about you. “You’d rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there’s no one left to sing."
15149,MANCE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11," You’re a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can’t understand why I won’t enlist my people in a foreigner’s war, there’s no point explaining."
15150,JON,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, I think you’re making a terrible mistake.
15151,MANCE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.
15152,STANNIS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11," Mance Rayder, you’ve been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy."
15153,STANNIS,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, Kneel and live.
15154,MANCE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11, This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
15155,MELISANDRE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11," Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false."
15156,MELISANDRE,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11," Free folk, there is only one true king, and his name is Stannis. Here stands the king of lies. Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness."
15157,BRAAVOSI MAN,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92," In the old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger, the titan would step with fire in his eyes. He'd wade into the sea and smash the enemies."
15158,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, He's just a statue.
15159,MAN,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, Don't be afraid. He’s announcing our arrival.
15160,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, I'm not afraid.
15161,MAN,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, The House of Black and White
15162,MAN,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92," Here, I leave you."
15163,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, Thank you for bringing me.
15164,MAN,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, Any man of Braavos would have done the same. Valar morghulis.
15165,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, Valar dohaeris.
15166,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, Hello. Valar Morghulis.
15167,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, Jaqen H’ghar gave me this.
15168,OLD MAN,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, No one here by that name.
15169,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, Please. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.
15170,OLD MAN,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, You have everywhere else to go.
15171,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, But wait!
15172,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92," Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant. Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant."
15173,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92," ...The Mountain, Meryn Trant."
15174,PODRICK,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, Must be good food if it’s crowded.
15175,WAITRESS,5,42,the house of black and white,Unnamed Scene_92, Ale? (pours ale and leaves table; goes to another table) Ale?
15176,SANSA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll."
15177,BAELISH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You are becoming an observant young lady.
15178,SANSA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," My mother used to say, ""dark wings, dark words""."
15179,BAELISH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.
15180,SANSA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, So it was good news.?
15181,BAELISH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, My marriage proposal has been accepted.
15182,SANSA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.
15183,WAITRESS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Ale?
15184,SANSA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I'll have some.
15185,PODRICK,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, My lady!
15186,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, What is it?
15187,PODRICK,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Sansa Stark. (Brienne begins to turn around) Don't look!
15188,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You sure?
15189,PODRICK,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," She's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish."
15190,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Littlefinger?
15191,PODRICK,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, A bunch of knights with him.
15192,PODRICK,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," 10, I think. Too many. My lady, I don't think this is the right--"
15193,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Ready the horses.
15194,PODRICK,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, We only have one horse.
15195,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Find more.
15196,BAELISH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Do you like the taste?
15197,SANSA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?
15198,BAELISH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, It gives some men courage.
15199,SANSA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Does it give you courage?
15200,GUARD,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, That's far enough.
15201,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth."
15202,BAELISH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then."
15203,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new."
15204,BAELISH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. (Brienne gets up) You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?"
15205,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I was.
15206,BAELISH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.
15207,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, It was after Renly's murder.
15208,BAELISH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him."
15209,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I tried to save him.
15210,BAELISH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, But you were accused.
15211,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, By men who didn't see what happened.
15212,BAELISH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Then what did happen?
15213,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.
15214,BAELISH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, A shadow? With a face? (scoffs) This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?
15215,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Why should you have any say in her affairs?
15216,BAELISH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved’s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."
15217,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--"
15218,SANSA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, No.
15219,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Please, my lady. If I could explain--"
15220,SANSA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.
15221,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.
15222,SANSA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, And sometimes we do. You should leave.
15223,BAELISH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?
15224,KNIGHT 1,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, He asked you to stay.
15225,GUARD,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, After her!
15226,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Podrick! (Podrick screams as he loses control of the horse)
15227,PODRICK,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Stop, stop, stop! (Horse stops) That’s a good boy."
15228,KNIGHT,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I guess that means you’re unarmed.
15229,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Down, Podrick, down!"
15230,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Podrick?
15231,PODRICK,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Yes, my lady?"
15232,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You can stand now.
15233,PODRICK,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Yes, my lady. (stands) Sansa Stark?"
15234,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We’ll follow them."
15235,PODRICK,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you’re released from your vow."
15236,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I swore to their mother I’d protect those girls.
15237,PODRICK,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, If they don’t want your protection--
15238,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Do you think she’s safe from Littlefinger?
15239,PODRICK,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," (pause) No, my lady."
15240,BRIENNE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Get your horse.INT. KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM
15241,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, A summons from the queen.
15242,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, There are only two like it in the world
15243,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, It’s a threat.
15244,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Of course it’s a threat! Our daughter’s in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. (mocking) ""It's a threat."""
15245,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, No note.
15246,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that’s befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!"
15247,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Softer.
15248,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, What?
15249,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Not so loud.
15250,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Our daughter’s in danger, and you’re worried I’m speaking too loudly!"
15251,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, The world can't know knows she’s our daughter.
15252,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Then don’t call her your daughter. You’ve never been a father to her.
15253,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," If I was the father to any of my children, they’d be stoned in the streets."
15254,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.
15255,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I’ll make things better.
15256,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You never made anything better.
15257,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I’m going to Dorne. I’ll bring our daughter home.
15258,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You can’t just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She’s promised his son.
15259,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I’m not going to ask him anything.
15260,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," You go there with an army, it’s an act of war."
15261,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, No army. Do you know where they’re keeping her?
15262,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
15263,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I’ll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?"
15264,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, (scoffs) You’re going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?
15265,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I never said I was going alone. (exit Jaime)EXT. THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE
15266,LOLLYS STOKEWORTH,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," No sunflowers. I don't like yellow. Roses are very nice, definitely roses. And music. I adore music. But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?"
15267,LOLLYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Don't they?
15268,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Don't who?
15269,LOLLYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, People eat pigeon pie in the capital.
15270,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do."
15271,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this."
15272,LOLLYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You won't.
15273,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Pardon?
15274,LOLLYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," We won't get to live at Stokeworth. When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older."
15275,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Oh.
15276,LOLLYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," She hates me. She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isn't looking."
15277,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.
15278,LOLLYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, She is.
15279,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another."
15280,LOLLYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Who's that?

15283,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
15284,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I was very sorry to hear about your father.
15285,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Thank you.
15286,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," This is my betrothed, Lollys."
15287,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, A pleasure. (he kisses her hand)
15288,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Run along, love."
15289,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Beautiful bride you've chosen. When were you planning on getting married?
15290,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Just get on with it.
15291,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, On with what?
15292,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.
15293,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, It's very good for you.
15294,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.
15295,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Mmm.
15296,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," We made a deal, your sister and I."
15297,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I would have advised against that.
15298,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, How is this good for me?
15299,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," 'Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle."
15300,BRONN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Return from where?
15301,JAIME,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, As far south as south goes.
15302,TRYSTANE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, My future queen.
15303,AREO,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, The prince does not wish to be disturbed.
15304,ELLARIA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Remove myself from my path, or I'll take that long axe and shove it--"
15305,DORAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Captain. Let her pass.
15306,ELLARIA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing."
15307,DORAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat. By law, that is not murder."
15308,ELLARIA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Your brother--
15309,DORAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.
15310,ELLARIA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, What will you do about his death.
15311,DORAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I will bury him. I will mourn for him.
15312,ELLARIA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You would have me go to war?
15313,DORAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You would have me go to war?
15314,ELLARIA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, The whole country would have you go to war.
15315,DORAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.
15316,ELLARIA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.
15317,ELLARIA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?"
15318,DORAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.
15319,ELLARIA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, And how long will that be?
15320,DAARIO,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, The Unsullied are too conspicuous.
15321,DAARIO,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?"
15322,DAARIO,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it..."
15323,GREY WORM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, No one here. We go.
15324,DAARIO,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, In a hurry? You're afraid?
15325,GREY WORM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Unsullied fear nothing.
15326,DAARIO,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide."
15327,DAARIO,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Fear is useful that way.
15328,MOSSADOR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him."
15329,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, It would send a message.
15330,BARRISTAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace."
15331,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Why?
15332,BARRISTAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," For one thing, he may have valuable information."
15333,DAARIO,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
15334,BARRISTAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, How do you know that?
15335,DAARIO,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Because I questioned him.
15336,HIZDAHR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," And the information you did get, he is young and poor."
15337,MOSSADOR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, He is born free.
15338,HIZDAHR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
15339,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
15340,MOSSADOR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.
15341,HIZDAHR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, And how do you know this?
15342,MOSSADOR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Everyone knows this.
15343,HIZDAHR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family."
15344,BARRISTAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," We do not know what this man did or didn't do. (to Daenerys) Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way."
15345,MOSSADOR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial"
15346,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Thank you all for your counsel.
15347,BARRISTAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you."
15348,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, About what?
15349,BARRISTAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, About your father. About the Mad King.
15350,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
15351,BARRISTAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first.  Your enemies did not lie."
15352,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Go on.
15353,BARRISTAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two."
15354,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I'm not my father.
15355,BARRISTAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end."
15356,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.
15357,BARRISTAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Your Grace.INT. PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE
15358,TYRION,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, There's a bug.
15359,VARYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food."
15360,TYRION,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? (finishes his cup of wine) Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?"
15361,VARYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You don't like it?
15362,TYRION,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I want to take a walk.
15363,VARYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
15364,TYRION,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
15365,VARYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
15366,TYRION,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You're right. No point. (realizing) The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
15367,VARYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, The road to Meereen.
15368,TYRION,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
15369,VARYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I told you. A ruler.
15370,TYRION,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
15371,VARYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand."
15372,TYRION,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I didn't rule. I was a servant.
15373,VARYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Still, a man of talent."
15374,TYRION,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Managed to kill a lot of people.
15375,VARYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well."
15376,TYRION,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.
15377,VARYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Why?
15378,TYRION,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, 'Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant. (takes a drink of wine)
15379,VARYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
15380,TYRION,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I find us repulsive.
15381,VARYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long."
15382,TYRION,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You're right. Let's go for a walk.
15383,VARYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, No.
15384,TYRION,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
15385,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Not him.
15386,MERYN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?"
15387,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made."
15388,HUNTERS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you."
15389,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Take the head.
15390,QYBURN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work."
15391,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Very good.
15392,QYBURN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Over there will be fine.
15393,MERYN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You heard the man. Over there.
15394,KEVAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You're the Hand of the King?
15395,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."
15396,MACE TYRELL,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--"
15397,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin."
15398,MACE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Oh, Your Grace."
15399,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
15400,MACE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," The honor is all mine, Your Grace."
15401,PYCELLE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand."
15402,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
15403,PYCELLE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?"
15404,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have."
15405,PYCELLE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I must say I cannot see--
15406,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title."
15407,KEVAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.
15408,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, The king is very busy at this moment.
15409,KEVAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," He should be here, learning what it means to rule."
15410,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf."
15411,KEVAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. (looks to Qyburn) Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
15412,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
15413,KEVAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, What mission?
15414,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, That is not your concern as Master of War.
15415,KEVAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.
15416,CERSEI,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You would abandon your king in his time of need?
15417,KEVAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock."
15418,SHIREEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Come on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.
15419,GILLY,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!
15420,SHIREEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Right, very good!"
15421,SAM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?"
15422,GILLY,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I know ""S""."
15423,SHIREEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things."
15424,GILLY,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Well, you're a wonderful teacher. (to Sam) Very patient!"
15425,SAM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read."
15426,GILLY,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.
15427,GILLY,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, How old were you when you learned to read?
15428,SHIREEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Three.
15429,SAM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Three?! Who taught you, your mother?"
15430,SHIREEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because... (trails off)
15431,GILLY,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?"
15432,SHIREEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?
15433,GILLY,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?
15434,SHIREEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?"
15435,GILLY,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.
15436,SAM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Did you ever see them?
15437,GILLY,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope."
15438,SHIREEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, What did he do to them in the woods?
15439,SHIREEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Mother.
15440,SELYSE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Leave us.
15441,SAM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Your Grace.
15442,SELYSE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You need to stay away from that girl.
15443,SHIREEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Why?
15444,SELYSE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, She's a wildling.
15445,SHIREEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.
15446,SELYSE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.
15447,SHIREEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Gilly wouldn't do that.
15448,SELYSE,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.
15449,STANNIS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you."
15450,JON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive."
15451,STANNIS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Who then? You?
15452,JON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, No. Only one of their own.
15453,STANNIS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?
15454,JON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, The Lord Commander's niece.
15455,STANNIS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response."
15456,JON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," ""Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."" (Jon smiles)"
15457,STANNIS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, That amuses you?
15458,JON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own."
15459,STANNIS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.
15460,DAVOS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win."
15461,JON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Most likely.
15462,DAVOS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?
15463,JON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Unpleasant, I expect."
15464,STANNIS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.
15465,JON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you."
15466,STANNIS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You can give me the North.
15467,JON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow."
15468,STANNIS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell."
15469,SAM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
15470,JON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again."
15471,SAM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.
15472,JON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I'm going to refuse him.
15473,SAM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
15474,JON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?"
15475,ALLISER,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.
15476,AEMON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?
15477,JANOS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings."
15478,MEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Hear, hear."
15479,JANOS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. He's the only true choice.
15480,AEMON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Is there anyone else?
15481,SHADOW TOWER BROTHER,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better."
15482,AEMON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," If there's no one else, we will begin the voting. The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne. The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. Each brother will--"
15483,SAM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Maester Aemon.
15484,AEMON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Samwell Tarly. Go on.
15485,JANOS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Sam the Slayer.
15486,JANOS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer?
15487,SAM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.
15488,JANOS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Lies!
15489,SAM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making."
15490,SAM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading."
15491,SAM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. (a man next to Sam nods) He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest."
15492,ALLISER,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I can't argue with any of that. (stands up) But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?"
15493,AEMON,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, It is time.
15494,BROTHER,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," It appears to be a tie, Maester."
15495,BROTHERS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
15496,MAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You. You!
15497,MAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, What have you got there?
15498,MAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, I said--
15499,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Turn around and go. (pulls out Needle) Turn around and go.
15500,MAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," That's a nice little sword. Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that. (pulls out his own sword)"
15501,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Nothing's worth anything to dead men.
15502,MEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Quickly, go, go!"
15503,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Who are you? Why were they scared of you?
15504,OLD MAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You lost this.
15505,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
15506,JAQEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.
15507,ARYA,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Well who are you then?
15508,JAQEN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, No one. And that is who a girl must become.
15509,HARPY,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," She doesn't belong here. And no matter how many of your traitors call her ""Mhysa"", she will never be your mother."
15510,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Why?
15511,MOSSADOR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," For you, Mhysa. (kneels) You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied. I set you free, as you did all of us."
15512,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right."
15513,MOSSADOR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt.
15514,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.
15515,MOSSADOR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? (beat) When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting. If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived."
15516,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--"
15517,MOSADOR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, --and now you are the law!
15518,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, The law is the law. Take him.
15519,CROWD,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Mhysa! Myhsa!
15520,HIZDAHR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, She should have cut off the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.
15521,DAARIO,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Which is what I keep telling her to do to you.
15522,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other.
15523,CROWD,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Brother! Brother!
15524,MOSSADOR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," Mhysa, please! Forgive me!"
15525,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death.
15526,CROWD,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Mercy! Mercy!
15527,MOSSADOR,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Mhysa... (prays in Valyrian)
15528,CROWD,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Mhysa...
15529,BARRISTAN,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1," I'll stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace."
15530,GREY WORM,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, We all guard tonight.
15531,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Leave me.
15532,DAENERYS,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1, Drogon...
15533,MAN,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_93, Valar morghulis.
15534,JAQEN,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_93, Valar dohaeris.
15535,ARYA,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_93, I've been sweeping this floor for days.
15536,JAQEN,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_93, Good.
15537,ARYA,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_93, I didn't come here to sweep floors.
15538,JAQEN,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_93," No? Why come, then?"
15539,ARYA,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_93, You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.
15540,JAQEN,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_93," A man teaches a girl. (Stands up). Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. (Walks away)."
15541,ARYA,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_93, I want to serve. (Jaqen stops).
15542,JAQEN,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_93," A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one."
15543,ARYA,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_93, Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.
15544,JAQEN,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_93, There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.
15545,ARYA,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_93, Where are they taking him?
15546,BYSTANDERS,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery!
15547,MARGAERY & TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," I am his/hers, and she/he is mine. From this day, until the end of my days."
15548,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, Did I hurt you?
15549,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, No. You were lovely.
15550,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, It all happened so fast.
15551,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, Yes. (Chuckles).
15552,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded"
15553,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived."
15554,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life."
15555,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," Wouldn't that be glorious? (They laugh. Tommen leans in to kiss her). Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?"
15556,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
15557,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name."
15558,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
15559,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, So strange… Husband.
15560,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," Wife. (They laugh). Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, (She chuckles), and it's all because my brother died."
15561,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty."
15562,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.
15563,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, Do you like to sail?
15564,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, (Sits up). I love to sail.
15565,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," I do, too."
15566,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," I think we're going to be very happy, you and I."
15567,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," I do, too."
15568,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?"
15569,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
15570,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. (Pours them some wine).
15571,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," Well, but I'm a man now."
15572,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, You are. And the king. (Hands him win). But you'll always be her baby-boy.
15573,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, I suppose.
15574,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. (Sits down and begins to comb her hair). Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight."
15575,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters."
15576,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
15577,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
15578,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, That's where you grew up. (They stop). You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
15579,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, (Chuckles). Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
15580,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home."
15581,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, This is my real home now. Where my family lives.
15582,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," I want you to be happy, mother."
15583,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy."
15584,TOMMEN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?
15585,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"" (Laugher). And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."""
15586,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, Mother! (Gets up and hugs Cersei). Welcome.
15587,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.
15588,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.
15589,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you."
15590,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, You are very sweet.
15591,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
15592,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.
15593,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
15594,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. (Margaery’s friends laugh)."
15595,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, I'll leave you to it then. (Turns to leave).
15596,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?"
15597,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, There's no need for such formalities.
15598,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13," In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon."
15599,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, Won’t that be a lovely day.
15600,MARGAERY,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.
15601,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13, Remember. Anything you need.
15602,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19, We can't hold the North with terror alone.
15603,RAMSAY,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19, You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.
15604,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19," I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies."
15605,RAMSAY,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19," Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot."
15606,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19, He left you no choice.
15607,RAMSAY,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19," I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch."
15608,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19, And?
15609,RAMSAY,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19, The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
15610,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19, (After a moment). I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.
15611,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19, We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?
15612,RAMSAY,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19, Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
15613,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19," I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. (Stands up). Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North."
15614,SANSA,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, That's Moat Cailin.
15615,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before."
15616,SANSA,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?"
15617,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, Home.
15618,SANSA,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," The Boltons have Winterfell. (He nods). The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?"
15619,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, (Shakes his head). No.
15620,SANSA,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!
15621,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, He did.
15622,SANSA,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, He serves the Lannisters.
15623,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, For now.
15624,SANSA,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, I won't go.
15625,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, Winterfell is your home.
15626,SANSA,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, Not anymore.
15627,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.
15628,SANSA,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.
15629,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -"
15630,SANSA,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, No!
15631,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, Sansa -
15632,SANSA,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there."
15633,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," (Grabbing her). I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. (Quietly). You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them."
15634,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, How do we get through there?
15635,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, We don't. We go around. (She turns her horse and begins leaving).
15636,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.
15637,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.
15638,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
15639,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, He hates that nickname.
15640,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?"
15641,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham."
15642,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, He borrowed it?
15643,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son."
15644,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, As punishment. For both of you.
15645,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
15646,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," (Walks away to get firewood). Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person."
15647,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
15648,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
15649,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
15650,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," You want to be a knight, Pod?"
15651,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, Yes.
15652,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. (Sits down). And I'm going to show you how to ride properly."
15653,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, Thank you.
15654,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight."
15655,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, I suppose that's more important.
15656,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?"
15657,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, I was.
15658,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
15659,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, He was.
15660,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, But how did you end up serving Renly?
15661,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," (After a few moments). When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. (Pauses). And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. (Smiles). My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. (Her smile drops). Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty’, they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They’re nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all."
15662,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
15663,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly."
15664,PODRICK,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5, But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
15665,BRIENNE,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5," A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed."
15666,STANNIS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, Lord Commander.
15667,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, (Stands up). Your Grace.
15668,STANNIS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, (To Olly as he closes the door). I'd like to speak alone.
15669,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13," Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command."
15670,STANNIS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, Very well. (They all sit down). Have you considered my offer?
15671,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
15672,STANNIS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, Say the word and you will be.
15673,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
15674,STANNIS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
15675,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13," I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
15676,STANNIS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
15677,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, I can imagine no higher praise.
15678,STANNIS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13," I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. (Stands up). But if your mind’s made up, I won't try to persuade you."
15679,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13," May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?"
15680,STANNIS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, Are you bored of us already?
15681,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
15682,STANNIS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
15683,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, And the wildlings?
15684,STANNIS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13," They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. (After a moment). Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead."
15685,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13," Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. (Olly stares at him)."
15686,STANNIS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.
15687,STANNIS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of  Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
15688,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
15689,STANNIS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.
15690,DAVOS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13," He sees something in you. (Jon looks up). Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you."
15691,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, I'm sorry I disappointed him.
15692,DAVOS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
15693,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, As long as he's ruling them.
15694,DAVOS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
15695,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, I’ve sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
15696,DAVOS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, Have you now? (Turning to Olly). How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.
15697,OLLY,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, Night gathers and now my watch begins -
15698,DAVOS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13," Not that bit, the bit at the end."
15699,OLLY,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13," I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -"
15700,DAVOS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13," Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing."
15701,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13, And what needs to be done?
15702,DAVOS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13," As long as the Boltons rule the North, (Stands up), the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion."
15703,ARYA,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1, What do you want?
15704,WAIF,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1, Who are you?
15705,ARYA,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1, What?
15706,WAIF,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1," You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. (Stops and walks to Arya). Who are you?"
15707,ARYA,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1," (After a moment, perks up). No one."
15708,ARYA,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1, Ow! Cunt!
15709,WAIF,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1," A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?"
15710,ARYA,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1," I told you, I'm no - (Gets hit again). Do that again and -"
15711,WAIF,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1, Who are you?
15712,ARYA,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1, You're about to find out.
15713,JAQEN,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1, What are you doing?
15714,WAIF,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1, We were only playing. The game of faces.
15715,JAQEN,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1, A girl is not ready.
15716,WAIF,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1, Clearly not.
15717,ARYA,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1, (Stands up). I am ready.
15718,JAQEN,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1, For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.
15719,JAQEN,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1," Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?"
15720,ARYA,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1, What do we do with them after we wash them?
15721,MAN,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_21, Open gates!
15722,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_21," Lady Sansa, welcome."
15723,SANSA,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_21, (Smiles). Lord Bolton.
15724,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_21," May I introduce my son, (Stands aside), Ramsay Bolton?"
15725,RAMSAY,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_21," It's an honor to meet you, my Lady."
15726,WOMAN,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_21, I'll bring you a bowl of hot water. You must want to wash.
15727,SANSA,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_21, Thank you.
15728,WOMAN,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_21," Welcome home, Lady Stark. (Quieter) The North remembers."
15729,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15, Sam. (Sam looks up. Jon looks at Maester Aemon’s chair). Maester Aemon?
15730,SAM,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15, He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.
15731,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15," Take good care of him. (To the group). Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. (Laughter. Jon looks at Alliser). First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. (Laughter. After a moment, he continues). Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger."
15732,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15," Ser Alliser. (Silence). You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger."
15733,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15, Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
15734,JANOS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15, (Scoffs). Greyguard is a ruin.
15735,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15," Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -"
15736,JANOS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15, I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.
15737,SAM,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15," Alright, alright! Enough of that."
15738,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15," You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard."
15739,JANOS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15," (Stands up, angrily shouts). I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!"
15740,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15, Are you refusing to obey my order?
15741,JANOS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15, You can stick your order up your bastard arse.
15742,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15, Take Lord Janos outside.
15743,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15," Olly, bring me my sword."
15744,JANOS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15," You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! (Everyone moves outside). Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken."
15745,JANOS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15," A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!"
15746,JON,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15," If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time."
15747,JANOS,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15," (Trembling). I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! (Jon brings his sword up). My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid."
15748,OLYVAR,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," You have served us well, my son."
15749,HIGH SEPTON,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," Thank you, Father."
15750,OLYVAR,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Which of the Seven will you worship today?
15751,HIGH SEPTON,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, The Maiden.
15752,OLYVAR,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Where is the Maiden?
15753,HIGH SEPTON,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, And the Stranger.
15754,OLYVAR,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," (Leaning forward). Two is extra, you realize?"
15755,HIGH SEPTON,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," Yes, yes."
15756,OLYVAR,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't -
15757,LANCEL,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, You have profaned our faith. The faith of our fathers and forefathers.
15758,HIGH SEPTON,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, I am the High Septon of the -
15759,LANCEL,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, (Grabs his neck). You are a sinner. And you shall be punished.
15760,CROWD,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!
15761,MAN 1,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Repent!
15762,CROWD,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!
15763,MAN 2,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Shame on you!
15764,CROWD,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Sinner! Sinner!
15765,HIGH SEPTON,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," (To Cersei) Your Grace, (To Pycelle), Grandmaester, (To Mace) Lord Tyrell, (To Qyburn), uh…"
15766,QYBURN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, It doesn't matter. (Mace sits down).
15767,HIGH SEPTON,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion."
15768,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, You were assaulted?
15769,HIGH SEPTON,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," I was, by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows’. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive."
15770,QYBURN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.
15771,MACE,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear."
15772,HIGH SEPTON,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother."
15773,QYBURN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?
15774,PYCELLE,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, A man's private affairs ought to stay private!
15775,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," What do you want from us, High Septon?"
15776,HIGH SEPTON,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -"
15777,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?
15778,MERYN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace."
15779,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. (To a man at the bottom of some stairs). Where can I find the High Sparrow?"
15780,MAN 1,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Seven blessings.
15781,MAN 2,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Thank you.
15782,MAN 3,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Just a little more...
15783,WOMAN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Thank you ever so for the soup!
15784,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?
15785,HIGH SPARROW,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. (Laughs). So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. (Prepares soup for the next person in line). The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me."
15786,WOMAN 2,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Seven blessings to you.
15787,HIGH SPARROW,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. (Prepares soup for the next person in line)."
15788,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Why no shoes?
15789,HIGH SPARROW,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
15790,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?
15791,HIGH SPARROW,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so."
15792,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, (Smiles). Perhaps they're right.
15793,HIGH SPARROW,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon."
15794,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?"
15795,HIGH SPARROW,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade."
15796,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you."
15797,HIGH SPARROW,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.
15798,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," (After a moment). My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. (The High Sparrow looks up at her surprised). The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another."
15799,QYBURN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Your Grace.
15800,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. (Hands him the letter)."
15801,QYBURN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," At once, Your Grace. (Walks to his desk)."
15802,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, How's your work coming along?
15803,QYBURN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, Very well.
15804,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15, You've made progress?
15805,QYBURN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but…"
15806,CERSEI,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediately""."
15807,QYBURN,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15," Shh. Easy, friend."
15808,RAMSAY,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23, She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.
15809,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23, I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She’s suffered enough.
15810,RAMSAY,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23, I'll never hurt her. You have my word.
15811,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23," I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go."
15812,RAMSAY,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23, I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.
15813,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23, (Approaching). And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.
15814,RAMSAY,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23," Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. (Bows)."
15815,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23, He seems pleased.
15816,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23, Shouldn't he be?
15817,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23," (They begin walking). I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must."
15818,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23," I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue."
15819,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23, Then I have delivered everything I've promised.
15820,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23, And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.
15821,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23," The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear."
15822,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23, The Queen will be enraged.
15823,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23," Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day."
15824,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23," And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. (They stop, and Roose holds up a letter). A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale."
15825,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23," A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken."
15826,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23," I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?"
15827,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23, Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
15828,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23, I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?
15829,BAELISH,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23," The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply."
15830,ROOSE,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23, I'd like to read the reply.
15831,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
15832,VARYS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Volantis is a large city.
15833,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
15834,VARYS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.
15835,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1," Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse."
15836,VARYS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.
15837,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, (Walks over to him). I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
15838,VARYS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, It's a perfectly good face.
15839,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, I'm losing my mind.
15840,VARYS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1," If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that."
15841,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1," Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. (Pulls his hood up). What am I? (Varys shakes his head). One more drunk dwarf."
15842,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Slaves.
15843,VARYS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. (Shot of a man with a fly tattooed onto his cheek). Flies for dung shovelers. (Shot of a man with a hammer tattooed onto his cheek). Hammers for builders. (Shot of a man inspecting women with tears tattooed onto their cheeks). Tears for whores. Lest they forget.
15844,PRIESTESS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, (Valyrian) Lord cast your light upon us.
15845,CROWD,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1," (Valyrian, in unison) Lord cast your light upon us."
15846,PRIESTESS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, (Valyrian) For the night is dark and full of terrors.
15847,VARYS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, (Aside) We should keep moving.
15848,CROWD,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1," (Valyrian, in unison) For the night is dark and full of terrors."
15849,PRIESTESS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, (Valyrian) I was once as you are now.
15850,PRIESTESS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1," (Valyrian) Bought and sold, (Varys approaches Tyrion), scourged and branded..."
15851,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.
15852,PRIESTESS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, (Valyrian) The Lord of Light hears your voice. He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery...
15853,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. (Varys shushes him worriedly).
15854,PRIESTESS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, (Valyrian) He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen!
15855,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?
15856,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, (Covering his face). Come on. Let's find a brothel.
15857,MAN,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, (Valyrian) It’s good luck to rub a dwarf’s head.
15858,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.
15859,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1," See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust."
15860,VARYS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Thank you.
15861,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Curious... hair. (She looks at him).
15862,MAN,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, (Across the room). The mother of dragons!
15863,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.
15864,VARYS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.
15865,MAN,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, What makes you worth that much?
15866,BLONDE PROSTITUTE,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, I’m magic. (They laugh).
15867,MAN,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, I bet you bloody are.
15868,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1," Well, (Watches her kiss the man), she's taken."
15869,VARYS,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Where're you going?
15870,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, I need to speak to someone with hair.
15871,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Hello?
15872,BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Hello.
15873,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, You've got no drink.
15874,BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, You've got no money.
15875,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1," Do I look like a man without money? (She looks at him incredulously). Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. (She laughs). But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? (Sits down). I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it."
15876,BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.
15877,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, That’s because they’ve never met a queen.
15878,BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, You're just saying that.
15879,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1," You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you."
15880,BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Why?
15881,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Because you have a skeptical mind.
15882,BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1," (Smiles). Alright, then. I'm warning you. We’re gonna have to wash you first."
15883,BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Come on.
15884,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1," (After a moment). I'm, I'm sorry, I can't."
15885,BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Of course you can. You're shy.
15886,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, I'm not.
15887,BLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, Have another drink.
15888,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1," Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I’ll go for a piss, that’s a start."
15889,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1," No need to worry, I was just - (Turns to see it’s not Varys, but Jorah). Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige."
15890,TYRION,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -
15891,JORAH,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1, I'm taking you to the Queen.
15892,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1, Is that Estermont?
15893,CAPTAIN,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1," Tarth, Ser Jaime. (Shot of an island). The Sapphire Isle."
15894,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1, Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?
15895,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1," This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night."
15896,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1, You ever been to Dorne?
15897,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1, No.
15898,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1, I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.
15899,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1, You should be happy to go back. (Drinks some water).
15900,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1," (Gets up, walking to his knife). There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. (Pulls out his knife from the sandbag). And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess."
15901,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1," We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,"
15902,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1, (Incredulously) Your niece?
15903,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1, I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. (Sits down).
15904,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1, That's why you're here.
15905,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1," I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one."
15906,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1, Because I don't want to start a war.
15907,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1, That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.
15908,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1, It has to be me.
15909,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1," (Gets up starts walking). If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, (Grabs some rope and walks back), who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -"
15910,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1, It has to be me.
15911,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1," (Sheaths his sword). You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that."
15912,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1, (Quietly) Varys set him free.
15913,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1," Well, if you ever see the little fucker, (Lays down), give him my regards."
15914,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1," He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards."
15915,MACE,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown's debts. Given the expense of rebuilding the royal -
15916,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, How much can the Crown afford?
15917,MACE,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," With winter coming, half what they ask. Less."
15918,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?
15919,MACE,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," Well, House Tyrell could front the gold, and the the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter."
15920,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," You've already given us too much. (Gets up and walks to a window). No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank."
15921,MACE,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Absolutely.
15922,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, In person.
15923,MACE,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," (After a moment, looks at her surprised). Me? (Qyburn smiles)."
15924,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified."
15925,MACE,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," I will be honored, Your Grace."
15926,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. (Smiling). He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.
15927,MACE,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, My very own Kingsguard? Please express -
15928,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," Safe travels, Lord Tyrell."
15929,MACE,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," (Raises his hands). Of course, of course, (Gathers his belongings, and then gets up). I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos."
15930,PYCELLE,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.
15931,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, (Walking out). Not small enough.
15932,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?"
15933,HIGH SPARROW,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, No. (Smiles).
15934,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. (Smiles).
15935,HIGH SPARROW,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure. But the truth is, (Chuckles), I don't like the taste."
15936,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Hmm.
15937,HIGH SPARROW,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, (After a moment). How may I serve?
15938,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.
15939,HIGH SPARROW,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods."
15940,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. (HS raises an eyebrow). In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven."
15941,HIGH SPARROW,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago."
15942,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy."
15943,HIGH SPARROW,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.
15944,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven."
15945,HIGH SPARROW,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," An honor I never expected. Or indeed, ever wished for."
15946,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," Which is why you were chosen. (HS smiles). You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most."
15947,HIGH SPARROW,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, All sinners are equal before the Gods.
15948,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, (Smiles. Continues after a moment). What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.
15949,HIGH SPARROW,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, May the Father judge him justly. (Smiles).
15950,MERCHANT,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Help me! Help me!
15951,OLYVAR,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, (Angrily). This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.
15952,MILITANT,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Cocksucker! (Man screams). Boy fucker! You barbaric filth! There's a special place in the Seventh Hell for your kind.
15953,CLIENT,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," Please, please, I'll pay! I'll pay all of you."
15954,MILITANT,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," (Pulls out a knife). Yes, you will! Seize him."
15955,MILITANT,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Seize him.
15956,LORAS,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Get your hands off of me.
15957,LANCEL,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of Gods and men."
15958,LORAS,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Who do you think you are?
15959,LANCEL,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Justice. (Loras grunts and struggles).
15960,MARGAERY,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Why is my brother in a cell?
15961,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," I, I don't know. I, I didn't order it."
15962,MARGAERY,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, We both know who did. (Walks away). You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.
15963,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, (Standing up). Are you saying my mother is behind this?
15964,MARGAERY,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.
15965,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Aren't you and mother getting along?
15966,MARGAERY,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," (Scoffs). Oh, my sweet, sweet King. (Sits down). Do you have any affection for me at all?"
15967,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, (Takes her hand). Of course I do. You're my Queen.
15968,MARGAERY,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.
15969,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, I'll set him free for you.
15970,MARGAERY,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Do you promise?
15971,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, I demand that Ser Loras be freed now!
15972,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, (Turns around). Did I arrest him?
15973,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," Well, no... But you armed the Faith Militant. You gave the High Sparrow an army."
15974,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. (Begins walking towards her desk). Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions."
15975,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Then can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?
15976,CERSEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy."
15977,KINGSGUARD,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Halt!
15978,MILITANT,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, His Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed.
15979,KINGSGUARD,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Give the order and we'll tear out this rebel.
15980,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?"
15981,KINGSGUARD,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, You'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love.
15982,MAN 1,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Bastard!
15983,MAN 2,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, You're an abomination!
15984,MAN 3,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, You're born of sin!
15985,WOMAN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Filthy bastard!
15986,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, We'll find another way.
15987,MAN 4,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Abomination!
15988,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, My Queen?
15989,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.
15990,MARGAERY,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm. And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law."
15991,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, I'm going to speak to the High Sparrow.
15992,MARGAERY,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Are you? When?
15993,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, I--I don't know.
15994,MARGAERY,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, You don't know?
15995,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, He was praying just now.
15996,MARGAERY,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, (Walking out). I have to send word to Grandmother.
15997,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Will you come back later? (Margaery stops).
15998,MARGAERY,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17," I need to be with my family, Your Grace. (Continues walking)."
15999,TOMMEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17, Of course.
16000,SELYSE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, You think highly of this boy.
16001,JON,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, (To some of the men sparring). Good.
16002,STANNIS,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
16003,SELYSE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, A bastard by some tavern slut.
16004,STANNIS,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way."
16005,SELYSE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, I should have given you a son.
16006,STANNIS,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, Not your fault.
16007,SELYSE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, Whose then? (Looks at their daughter Shireen). I gave you nothing but weakness. (Turns back). And deformity. (Stannis shakes his head).
16008,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, (Walking towards them). Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.
16009,SELYSE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, My Lady.
16010,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, Her father is the Lord's chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins.
16011,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, You march on Winterfell soon?
16012,STANNIS,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, We must. To beat the snows.
16013,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again.
16014,STANNIS,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, I won't. I need you.
16015,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," You only need faith, my King."
16016,STANNIS,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," (Walking away). And you, my Lady, what do you need?"
16017,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, To serve my Lord.
16018,SAM,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, Lord Ashford. (Jon signs). Lady Caulfield. (Jon signs). Lord Smallwood.
16019,JON,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, Never even heard of these people.
16020,SAM,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, They haven't heard of you either. (Jon signs). But we need men and they have some.
16021,JON,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?
16022,SAM,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," (Chuckles, looking at the next letter). More than Lord Wibberley."
16023,JON,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, Not him.
16024,SAM,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North."
16025,JON,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, He murdered my brother.
16026,SAM,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.
16027,SAM,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," Apologies, my Lady."
16028,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, Lord Commander.
16029,JON,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, How can I help you?
16030,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," Come with us when we ride south. (Walks forwards). None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? (Turns to Jon)."
16031,JON,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
16032,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. (Walks in front of Jon).
16033,JON,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions."
16034,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, No visions. No magic. Just life.
16035,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it."
16036,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows."
16037,JON,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, I don't think Stannis would like that very much.
16038,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, Then we shouldn't tell him. (Starts unbuttoning Jon’s coat).
16039,JON,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, I can't.
16040,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, Why?
16041,JON,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, I swore a vow. (Melisandre looks at him incredulously). I loved another.
16042,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.
16043,JON,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, I know. But I still love her.
16044,MELISANDRE,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," You know nothing, Jon Snow."
16045,STANNIS,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, Are you lonely?
16046,SHIREEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," (Turns around, holding something). Just bored."
16047,STANNIS,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.
16048,SHIREEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," (Looks up). Were you bored a lot, too?"
16049,STANNIS,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -"
16050,SHIREEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, I like it. (Walks to a table). I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. (Picks up an X from the table).
16051,STANNIS,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, Why do you say that?
16052,SHIREEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," She told me, ""I don't want to bring you."""
16053,STANNIS,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5, She shouldn't have said that.
16054,SHIREEN,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," Are you ashamed of me, father?"
16055,STANNIS,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5," When you were an infant, (Stands up and walks around his desk), the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, (Shireen smiles), and you pressed it to your cheek. (Looks down. Shireen’s smile drops). By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. (Walks to the table and adjusts the objects on it). I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. (Turns to her). Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. (Shireen smiles). I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. (Walks towards her). You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter."
16056,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, I thought I might find you here. (Sansa turns to him). Your Aunt Lyanna.
16057,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25," Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful."
16058,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25," I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?"
16059,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25," Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her."
16060,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, Come. (Takes her arm). Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. (They begin walking away).
16061,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, Dressed for riding?
16062,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, I am.
16063,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, Where are you going?
16064,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, King's Landing.
16065,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, King's Landing?
16066,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, Cersei sent for me. (They stop). We must not let her sniff out any trouble.
16067,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, You can't leave me here!
16068,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25," I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long."
16069,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, How do you know?
16070,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25," (They begin walking again). Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell."
16071,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, You don't know that.
16072,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25," I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne."
16073,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, You think he'll defeat the Boltons?
16074,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25," He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. (They stop). As it happens, I am a betting man."
16075,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, And if you're right?
16076,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25," Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North."
16077,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25," But I, I wouldn't… Wardeness of the North"
16078,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.
16079,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25," What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?"
16080,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25," Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours."
16081,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, I don't know how to do that.
16082,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.
16083,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, His father frightens me.
16084,BAELISH,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25," He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you’ve learnt to maneuver from the very best. (Puts a hand on her shoulder). I return before too long. (Puts a hand behind her head). You'll be strong without me. (She nods, and he kisses her). The North will be yours. Do you believe me?"
16085,SANSA,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25, I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.
16086,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Breakfast.
16087,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, That would have been a shit way to die.
16088,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die."
16089,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.
16090,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
16091,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me."
16092,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Sounds like all the rest.
16093,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, What about you? What shit way would you choose?
16094,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune."
16095,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
16096,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?
16097,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, In the arms of the woman I love.
16098,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, She want the same thing?
16099,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Let's go.
16100,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," The captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?"
16101,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Pentoshi.
16102,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, And he's headed to Oldtown?
16103,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, As I said. Why?
16104,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?
16105,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, A bag of gold.
16106,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
16107,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, It was a heavy bag.
16108,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.
16109,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, How many you count?
16110,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Four.
16111,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, How many you think you can take?
16112,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," One, if he's slow."
16113,RIDER,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Halt!
16114,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," Fucked in the arse. (Both get up). Hiya! (The riders approach them). Morning, lads. Glad we found you."
16115,RIDER,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Who are you?
16116,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Cooper. (Points to Jaime). This is Darnell.
16117,RIDER,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, You're from King's Landing.
16118,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.
16119,RIDER,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Why are you here?
16120,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really."
16121,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, I thought the sharks would get us. (Bronn looks at him).
16122,RIDER,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, There are no sharks in Dorne.
16123,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, I could have sworn those were shark fins.
16124,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Dolphins maybe.
16125,RIDER,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Throw your swords in the sand.
16126,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home."
16127,RIDER,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Swords in the sand! Now!
16128,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, That one should be slow enough.
16129,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Nice move! (Jaime turns to him).
16130,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Luck.
16131,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, You had a wonderful teacher.
16132,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.
16133,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, First we need to bury these bodies.
16134,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Birds have to eat too.
16135,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war."
16136,BRONN,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
16137,JAIME,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," (Holding out his hand). I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really."
16138,TYENE,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Nama!
16139,ELARIA,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," Nym, Obara."
16140,OBARA,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Will it be war?
16141,ELARIA,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves."
16142,OBARA,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.
16143,ELARIA,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," We don't need an army to start a war. (Drinks water). Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them."
16144,NYMERIA,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, We may have a problem.
16145,OBARA,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne."
16146,ELARIA,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war."
16147,TYENE,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, (Walks towards her). I'm with you. Always. (Elaria puts a hand to her face).
16148,ELARIA,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, Nym? (Nymeria nods). Obara?
16149,OBARA,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1," When I was a child, (Begins walking), Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl."
16150,OBARA,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1, (Smiles). I made my choice long ago.
16151,TYRION,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1, Thank you. (After a long pause). Who are you?
16152,JORAH,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1, Your captor.
16153,TYRION,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1, Do you have wine?
16154,JORAH,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1, No.
16155,TYRION,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1, I can't sleep without wine.
16156,JORAH,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1, Then stay awake.
16157,TYRION,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1, You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.
16158,JORAH,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1, I'm not taking you to your sister.
16159,TYRION,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1, You said you were taking me to the Queen.
16160,JORAH,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1, I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.
16161,TYRION,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1, (Chuckles). What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
16162,JORAH,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1, What business would you have with the Queen?
16163,TYRION,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1," Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? (Holds out his hands expectantly. Jorah makes no move to respond). A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. (Jorah looks downtrodden). And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely."
16164,DAENERYS,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, Everyone looks happy enough from up here. (Barristan chuckles). What?
16165,BARRISTAN,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1," I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing."
16166,DAENERYS,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, Why?
16167,BARRISTAN,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1," He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them."
16168,DAENERYS,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, He sang to them?
16169,BARRISTAN,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.
16170,DAENERYS,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, And what did you do?
16171,BARRISTAN,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. (Daenerys looks surprised). Well he liked to see how much he could make.
16172,DAENERYS,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, He was good?
16173,BARRISTAN,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, He was very good. Viserys never told you?
16174,DAENERYS,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. (Sits down).
16175,BARRISTAN,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.
16176,DAENERYS,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, And what did you do with the money?
16177,BARRISTAN,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1," Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. (They both laugh)."
16178,DARIO,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1," (Entering). Your Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber."
16179,DAENERYS,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, How many others are there?
16180,DARIO,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, Fifty a hundred.
16181,DAENERYS,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1," Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?"
16182,DARIO,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.
16183,DAENERYS,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1," I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me."
16184,BARRISTAN,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, Your Grace. (Leaves).
16185,HIZDAHR,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, All men must die. But not all can die in glory.
16186,MISSANDEI,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, Glory?
16187,HIZDAHR,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1," Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have."
16188,DAENERYS,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
16189,HIZDAHR,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1," Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season."
16190,DAENERYS,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, I do not recognize this tradition.
16191,HIZDAHR,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1," Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. (Shots of Sons of the Harpy walking through tunnels with torches). Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start."
16192,WOMAN,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1, (Speaking another language) Sons of the Harpy.
16193,HIZDAHR,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_94," I am so sorry, my queen. He was a good man."
16194,DAENERYS,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_94," ""Barristan the Bold"" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks."
16195,DAARIO,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_94," We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide."
16196,DAENERYS,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_94, I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.
16197,HIZDAHR,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_94, But... I'm the leader of my family.
16198,HIZDAHR,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_94," No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace!"
16199,DAENERYS,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_94, (in Valyrian) Walk forward.
16200,MAN,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_94, (Valyrian) You cannot do this.
16201,DAENERYS,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_94, (Valyrian) Another step.
16202,DAENERYS,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_94," (Valyrian) They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don’t. Children. Some say I should give up on them. (One of the men is mumbling). But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must."
16203,DAENERYS,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_94, (Valyrian) But she does not give up on them.
16204,DAENERYS,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_94," (Valyrian) Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, (Looks at Hizdahr), maybe none of you are. Maybe, (Touching Hizdahr’s arm), I should let the dragons decide."
16205,HIZDAHR,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_94, (Valyrian) All men must die.
16206,DAENERYS,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_94, Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.
16207,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," ""And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure."" She sounds like quite a woman."
16208,AEMON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying."
16209,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," Don't say that, Maester Aemon."
16210,AEMON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing."
16211,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, Maester Aemon.
16212,AEMON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, Lord Commander.
16213,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone."
16214,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, How are you feeling?
16215,AEMON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death."
16216,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order."
16217,AEMON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it."
16218,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, But you don't know what it is.
16219,AEMON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born."
16220,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, Where are the rest of the free folk now? (Tormund scoffs). Where have they gone? (No response). Who leads them?
16221,TORMUND,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.
16222,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, What about you?
16223,TORMUND,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, Hard to lead when you're in chains.
16224,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, What if I unchained you?
16225,TORMUND,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, Why would you do that?
16226,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
16227,TORMUND,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
16228,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you."
16229,TORMUND,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, And now everything is going to change?
16230,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, It is.
16231,TORMUND,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, Why now?
16232,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," Because now, (Leans forward), I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."
16233,TORMUND,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," What would you have me do, (Leans forward), Lord Commander?"
16234,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, (Stands up). I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
16235,TORMUND,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, They won't kneel for you and neither will I.
16236,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
16237,TORMUND,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.
16238,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
16239,TORMUND,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, (Stands up). Easy thing to say to a man in chains.
16240,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
16241,TORMUND,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?
16242,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, Up on Storrold's Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
16243,TORMUND,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, We'll need ships.
16244,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
16245,TORMUND,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding won’t be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go."
16246,MAN 1,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," You'd bring wildlings here, through our gates?"
16247,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing."
16248,MAN 1,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, Let them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us.
16249,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, Fewer.
16250,DAVOS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, What?
16251,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, Nothing.
16252,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, (Standing up) There is good farmland in the Gift. (Laughter). Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.
16253,MAN 2,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.
16254,ALLISTER,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.
16255,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, And we've slaughtered theirs.
16256,EDD,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. (Men mumble in agreement). They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it."
16257,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that."
16258,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," Thank you. (Olly walks away). Olly. (He stops). If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right."
16259,OLLY,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them."
16260,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, It's not a trick.
16261,OLLY,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew."
16262,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.
16263,OLLY,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17," Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?"
16264,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17, No.
16265,PODRICK,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, She's far away from the Lannisters. This is her home. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
16266,BRIENNE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, (Turns around). Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.
16267,BRIENNE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Thank you. You've lived here a long time?
16268,MAN,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Aye.
16269,BRIENNE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Did you know Lord Eddard?
16270,MAN,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, I knew him and his father before him. The Starks are gone now.
16271,BRIENNE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.
16272,MAN,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Everyone knows. The Boltons.
16273,BRIENNE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.
16274,MAN,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Who are you?
16275,BRIENNE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Someone who swore to keep her safe.
16276,MAN,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Swore to who?
16277,BRIENNE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Her mother.
16278,MAN,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Her mother's dead.
16279,BRIENNE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?
16280,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Come back here. Myranda.
16281,MYRANDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, I saw you staring at her.
16282,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.
16283,MYRANDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, You said you'd marry me.
16284,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.
16285,MYRANDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Do you think she's pretty?
16286,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Of course I do. I'm not blind.
16287,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you."
16288,MYRANDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," Perhaps I'll marry, too."
16289,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," (Laughs). You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? (She tries to hit him, but he restrains her). You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?"
16290,MYRANDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, (Smiles). Never.
16291,WOMAN,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," Beg pardon, my lady. I've come to refill the wash basin."
16292,SANSA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," Oh, I don't need-"
16293,WOMAN,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," (Closes the door). You still have friends in the North. If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower."
16294,SANSA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, But who -
16295,WOMAN,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, You're not alone.
16296,MYRANDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, I like your dress. Who made it for you?
16297,SANSA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, I made it myself.
16298,MYRANDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Really?
16299,SANSA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," Who, who are you?"
16300,MYRANDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? (Takes Sansa’s arm and inspects her sleeve). Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?"
16301,SANSA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, My mother. (Pulls away).
16302,MYRANDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, I'm sorry for what happened to her.
16303,SANSA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Thank you.
16304,MYRANDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," It's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her."
16305,SANSA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, I'd rather have a mother.
16306,MYRANDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," I know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember."
16307,MYRANDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Down there at the end.
16308,SANSA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, What is it?
16309,MYRANDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it."
16310,SANSA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Theon?
16311,THEON,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, You shouldn't be here.
16312,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, You smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine.
16313,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Do you have something to tell me?
16314,THEON,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," No, my lord."
16315,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Reek.
16316,THEON,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, (Stuttering). She saw me.
16317,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Who?
16318,THEON,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.
16319,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, She saw you?
16320,THEON,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -"
16321,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Come here.
16322,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees."
16323,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Give me your hand.
16324,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, I forgive you.
16325,ROOSE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady."
16326,SANSA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," Yes, thank you, my lord."
16327,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Allow me.
16328,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Mother.
16329,WALDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," Thank you, Ramsay."
16330,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," My lady, we are all a family, we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth."
16331,ROOSE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, (Raises his cup). To your wedding.
16332,WALDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, (Raises her cup). To your wedding.
16333,WALDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.
16334,SANSA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.
16335,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," You're right. Very strange. More wine, please."
16336,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. (Theon begins pouring wine). I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?"
16337,THEON,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," (Turns around). Yes, master."
16338,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," That's his new name, Reek."
16339,SANSA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Why are you doing this?
16340,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? (He gestures Theon over). An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers."
16341,THEON,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," (After a moment, stuttering). I'm sorry."
16342,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye."
16343,THEON,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, I'm sorry.
16344,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Sorry about what?
16345,THEON,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, For killing your brothers.
16346,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. (Theon turns to leave). You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?"
16347,ROOSE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," Yes, yes, very good."
16348,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Wonderful. (Sips wine).
16349,ROOSE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together."
16350,WALDA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, We're going to have a baby.
16351,SANSA,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, I'm very happy for you.
16352,ROOSE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy."
16353,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, How can you be sure?
16354,ROOSE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Sure of what?
16355,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?
16356,ROOSE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.
16357,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, So how did you manage it?
16358,ROOSE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Manage what?
16359,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Getting her pregnant.
16360,ROOSE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.
16361,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," Of course, but how did you find it?"
16362,ROOSE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl."
16363,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, And if it's a boy?
16364,ROOSE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, You're worried about your position.
16365,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.
16366,ROOSE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, You've never asked me about your mother.
16367,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are."
16368,ROOSE,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27," She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. (Stands up). But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. (After a moment). Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?"
16369,RAMSAY,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27, Yes.
16370,GILLY,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, Is this every book there is?
16371,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, Every book there is?
16372,GILLY,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, In the world.
16373,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually."
16374,GILLY,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," Where you grew up, were there more books?"
16375,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
16376,GILLY,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, Where's that?
16377,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, The Citadel? In Oldtown.
16378,GILLY,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, I'm sorry I don't know things.
16379,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound."
16380,GILLY,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.
16381,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, Well -
16382,GILLY,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
16383,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, It's where they train the maesters.
16384,GILLY,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, Like Maester Aemon?
16385,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you."
16386,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," Ah, Your Grace."
16387,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, You're Samwell Tarly?
16388,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," I am, Your Grace."
16389,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker."
16390,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," I did, Your Grace."
16391,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, How?
16392,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, With a dagger made of dragonglass.
16393,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, Dragonglass?
16394,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, What the maesters call obsidian -
16395,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?
16396,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass."
16397,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
16398,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," I've seen it, Your Grace."
16399,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, Seen what?
16400,SAM,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, The army of the dead. And when they come -
16401,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," We have to know how to fight them. (After a moment). Keep reading, Samwell Tarly."
16402,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, It's time.
16403,DAVOS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men."
16404,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise."
16405,DAVOS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.
16406,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," No need, they're coming with us."
16407,DAVOS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -"
16408,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us."
16409,DAVOS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," As you wish, Your Grace."
16410,SHIREEN,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, (On horseback). Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?
16411,DAVOS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, Beg your pardon?
16412,SHIREEN,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-
16413,DAVOS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.
16414,SHIREEN,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, Is there going to be a battle?
16415,DAVOS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -"
16416,SELYSE,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos. You'll scare the child."
16417,DAVOS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," Yes, my queen."
16418,SHIREEN,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, I'm not scared.
16419,DAVOS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me."
16420,SHIREEN,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, (Smiling). I promise.
16421,STANNIS,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19, I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.
16422,JON,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19," You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you."
16423,MISSANDEI,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,  You're still too weak. (He lays back down).
16424,GREY WORM,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1, (Valyrian) How long have I been here?
16425,MISSANDEI,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1, (Valyrian) Three days.
16426,GREY WORM,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1, Ser Barristan?
16427,GREY WORM,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1," (Valyrian) I failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen."
16428,MISSANDEI,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1," (Valyrian) You failed no one. You fought bravely. You’ll fight again. (In Common Tongue) Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known."
16429,GREY WORM,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1," This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid."
16430,MISSANDEI,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1, All men fear death.
16431,GREY WORM,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1," No, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath."
16432,MISSANDEI,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1, Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.
16433,DAENERYS,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1," If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?"
16434,MISSANDEI,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1," Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters."
16435,DAENERYS,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1, (Sitting down). You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?
16436,MISSANDEI,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1," I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. (Sitting down). I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see."
16437,HIZDAHR,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1," My, my queen, please do not do this."
16438,DAENERYS,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1," What about ""Valar Morghulis""?"
16439,HIZDAHR,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1, I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. (Sniffles).
16440,DAENERYS,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1," It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live."
16441,HIZDAHR,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1," Yes, my queen."
16442,DAENERYS,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1," And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. (Hizdahr nods). Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees."
16443,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1," Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. (No response). Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen."
16444,JORAH,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, We are.
16445,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.
16446,JORAH,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, No wine.
16447,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1," I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not…"
16448,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.
16449,JORAH,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, I am.
16450,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, Have you sailed this route before?
16451,JORAH,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, No.
16452,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?
16453,JORAH,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, I think you'll be plenty.
16454,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?
16455,JORAH,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, No. But the pirates are.
16456,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, Oh.

16458,JORAH,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, And then they weren't.
16459,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1," And then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"""

16461,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, I would clap.
16462,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1," I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains."
16463,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, What was that?
16464,JORAH,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!
16465,JORAH,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, Get behind!
16466,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1," Mormont, cut me free! (Jorah falls into the water). Mormont!"
16467,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, Mormont! Mormont!
16468,JORAH,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, (Faintly). Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.
16469,JORAH,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?
16470,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1," (Shakes his head). You? (Jorah shakes his head). I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that."
16471,JORAH,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, I suppose that's why they send them there.
16472,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1," It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. (Jorah spits). Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. (Jorah gets up). So what now?"
16473,JORAH,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1," We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat."
16474,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, Without luck?
16475,JORAH,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1," We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?"
16476,TYRION,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1, That's the best idea you've had all day.
16477,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, What are they doing with the bodies?
16478,WAIF,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Get back to work.
16479,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, No! I’ve been here for weeks. I’m not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I’m doing it.
16480,WAIF,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You will know why.
16481,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, When?
16482,WAIF,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, When it’s time. Not before. Get back to work.
16483,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, When do I get to play the game?
16484,WAIF,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Game?
16485,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, The game. The game of faces.
16486,WAIF,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You tried already. You failed.
16487,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I didn’t even know I was playing.
16488,WAIF,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Who are you?
16489,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, No one.
16490,WAIF,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Get back to work.
16491,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Well who are you? What are you doing here? How’d you get here?
16492,WAIF,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," I’m from Westeros. Just like you. Daughter of a Lord. Just like you. Except I was an only child. Heir to his fortune. My mother died. My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn’t want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. I’ve been serving them ever since."
16493,WAIF,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Was that true or a lie?
16494,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, What?
16495,WAIF,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Did you believe every word I said?
16496,WAIF,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Get back to work.
16497,JAQEN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Who are you?
16498,JAQEN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Who are you?
16499,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Arya.
16500,JAQEN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, And where did you come from?
16501,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I’m the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.
16502,JAQEN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, A lie.
16503,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.
16504,JAQEN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, A lie.
16505,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.
16506,JAQEN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, A lie.
16507,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn’t. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him."
16508,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I hated him.
16509,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I hated him!
16510,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, That’s not a lie!
16511,JAQEN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?
16512,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Yes.
16513,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I’m not playing this stupid game anymore!
16514,JAQEN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, We never stop playing.
16515,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can’t live on berries and roots."
16516,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I can.
16517,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You’re not hungry?
16518,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Of course I’m hungry.
16519,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," You’re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met."
16520,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I am not your travelling companion.
16521,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, We are travelling together. In each other’s company. Therefore…
16522,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Do you ever shut up?
16523,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I sailed from King’s Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.
16524,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Why?
16525,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
16526,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I’m sure you’ve visited many brothels in many cities.
16527,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn’t commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.
16528,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man."
16529,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, What do you know about my father?
16530,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”"
16531,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You didn’t know. I’m sorry. I am.
16532,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, How?
16533,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I only know what I heard
16534,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, How?
16535,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.
16536,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, We better keep moving.
16537,MAN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Valar morghulis.
16538,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Valar dohaeris.
16539,MAN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I have nowhere else to go. I’ve taken her to every healer in Braavos. I’ve spent every penny I had. She suffers every day of her life. I just want it to end.
16540,GIRL,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, It hurts.
16541,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," I know. Don’t be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me."
16542,ARYA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I’ve devoted my life to him now. You don’t want to hurt anymore. Drink.
16543,JAQEN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?"
16544,JAQEN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.
16545,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert’s Rebellion."
16546,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Do you believe in anything?
16547,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I believe in many things.
16548,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?"
16549,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, No.
16550,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I’d find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?"
16551,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, No.
16552,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, It's hard to be a cynic after that.
16553,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen.
16554,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, No it doesn’t.
16555,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?"
16556,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, First we have to conquer the world.
16557,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," We? Alright, let’s assume your dreams come true. She’s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"
16558,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Then she rules.
16559,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That’s justice?
16560,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, She is the rightful heir.
16561,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?"
16562,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Shh! It’s a slave ship
16563,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Why is it anchored?
16564,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, They probably came ashore for--
16565,MALKO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, --water.
16566,MALKO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Got a lot of fight in you, huh?"
16567,SLAVER,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Salt mines.
16568,MALKO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.
16569,SLAVER,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, What about the dwarf?
16570,MALKO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Worthless. Cut his throat.
16571,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let’s discuss this!"
16572,MALKO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf’s cock has magic powers.
16573,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can’t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?"
16574,SLAVER,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, It will be a dwarf-sized cock.
16575,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Guess again.
16576,MALKO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.
16577,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
16578,MALKO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," We’re bound to Volantis, not Slaver’s Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits."
16579,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," The fighting puts in Mereen! You’re in luck then, you’re about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms."
16580,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, (looks at Jorah) Him.
16581,MALKO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Him? He’s got to be 60 years old.
16582,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Sure, he’s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!"
16583,MALKO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Is that true?
16584,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself."
16585,TYRION,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, The Kingslayer!
16586,MALKO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Jousting. You’re talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.
16587,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.
16588,MALKO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Liar.
16589,JORAH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," It’s no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver’s Bay, put a sword in my hand, I’ll prove my worth."
16590,LANCEL,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Lord Baelish.
16591,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Yes? (Lancel approaches him) Lancel Lannister.
16592,LANCEL,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.
16593,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, That’s quite a family to abandon.
16594,LANCEL,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run."
16595,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Well done.
16596,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I’m here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I’ll be delayed?
16597,LANCEL,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You’ll find that there’s little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King’s Landing."
16598,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining."
16599,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Do you think it’s wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?"
16600,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
16601,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.
16602,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, The King’s orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras’ perversion?
16603,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, House Tyrell won’t tolerate these insults.
16604,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," House Tyrell won’t tolerate it? I’m the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys."
16605,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, One’s choice of companion is a curious thing.
16606,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you’re still in mourning.
16607,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
16608,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."
16609,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
16610,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
16611,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
16612,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Good. (Cersei gets up) If there’s nothing else.
16613,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn’t trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell."
16614,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, That’s not possible.
16615,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen."
16616,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
16617,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
16618,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, We were fools to trust a turncloak.
16619,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
16620,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
16621,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," I would counsel patience, your grace."
16622,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor."
16623,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they’re done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."
16624,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn."
16625,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force."
16626,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
16627,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Ser Jaime, then."
16628,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I’ve no idea when he’ll be back.
16629,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow."
16630,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man."
16631,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," You wouldn’t risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?"
16632,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, And if you succeed?
16633,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Name me Warden of the North.
16634,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I’ll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
16635,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I’ll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
16636,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, And I’ll l know you’re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark’s head on a spike.
16637,BAELISH,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, As I said. I live to serve.
16638,TRYSTANE,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I’m going to ask him tomorrow.
16639,MYRCELLA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, What if he says no?
16640,TRYSTANE,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, He won’t. You’ve waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?
16641,MYRCELLA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you…"
16642,MYRCELLA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, We can’t. Not yet.
16643,TRYSTANE,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Why not?
16644,MYRCELLA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You know why not. Someone will see.
16645,TRYSTANE,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.
16646,MYRCELLA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?
16647,TRYSTANE,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I like the way your eyes go squinty when you’re jealous.
16648,MYRCELLA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," They don’t go squinty, and you didnt answer the question."
16649,DORAN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.
16650,AREO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Yes, my prince."
16651,DORAN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.
16652,AREO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I remember how.
16653,BRONN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman’s blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman’s wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...
16654,JAIME,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Alright, thats enough."
16655,BRONN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I’m coming to the best part.
16656,JAIME,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, We’re trying to blend in. We don’t want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
16657,BRONN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, This song really is all about the ending.
16658,JAIME,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, It can wait. Up there.
16659,JAIME,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, That’s the Water Gardens.
16660,BRONN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Once we got the princess, then what?"
16661,JAIME,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I like to improvise.
16662,BRONN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, That explains the golden hand.
16663,ELLARIA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn."
16664,SAND SNAKES,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, For Oberyn.
16665,BRONN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Well, she’s made herself at home."
16666,JAIME,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Myrcella.
16667,MYRCELLA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Uncle Jaime? I don’t understand, what are you doing here?"
16668,JAIME,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Let’s speak in private.
16669,TRYSTANE,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I am Trystane Martell.
16670,MYRCELLA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Trystane is my intended.
16671,JAIME,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Excellent. Good to meet you.
16672,TRYSTANE,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," We weren’t expecting you, Ser Jaime."
16673,BRONN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Why don’t you let them have some time alone, son?"
16674,BRONN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Let’s not do something stupid.
16675,MYRCELLA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, No!
16676,BRONN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, That was something stupid.
16677,JAIME,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," We have to go, Myrcella, now."
16678,MYRCELLA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You hurt him!
16679,JAIME,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," You’ll be fine, I promise, but we have to--"
16680,BRONN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Oh for fuck’s sake.
16681,OBARA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You’re coming with me.
16682,MYRCELLA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I don’t want to!
16683,OBARA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," I wasn’t asking, princess."
16684,AREO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Drop you weapons!
16685,OBARA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?
16686,AREO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Drop your weapons!
16687,AREO,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," When you were whole, it would have been a good fight."
16688,BRONN,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You fight pretty good for a little girl.
16689,RIDER,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Halt!
16690,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on."
16691,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Rumors and gossip, that’s all they got. It’s theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King’s Landing there’d be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."
16692,MARGAERY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Everyone knew about him and Renly.
16693,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
16694,MARGAERY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, But he was the king’s brother.
16695,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," And Loras is the queen’s brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable."
16696,MARGAERY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Cersei is behind this.
16697,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister."
16698,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Your Grace, I have travelled a long way."
16699,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You must be exhausted.
16700,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren’t writing anything."
16701,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns."
16702,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
16703,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Beg your pardon.
16704,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I know you’re behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
16705,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
16706,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You’ll get your apology when I get Loras.
16707,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
16708,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
16709,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
16710,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Do you expect the alliance to continue after you’ve thrown our future into prison?
16711,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," As I said, i didn’t imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--"
16712,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, What veil?
16713,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
16714,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I didn’t trust your father. I didn’t particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
16715,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I’m sure they don’t. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we’ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna."
16716,HIGH SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
16717,LORAS,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I don’t pay attention to rumors.
16718,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis’ army closed in"
16719,LORAS,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, He was my friend. He was my king.
16720,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Wasn’t Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly."
16721,LORAS,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I was wrong to support Renly’s claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.
16722,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Wearing Renly’s armor.
16723,LORAS,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Why does it matter what I wore?
16724,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy."
16725,LORAS,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Of course I deny them.
16726,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You never lay with Renly Baratheon.
16727,LORAS,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Never.
16728,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Nor any other man.
16729,LORAS,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Never.
16730,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, That will be all Ser Loras.
16731,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Well I think that’s quite enough of that.
16732,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.
16733,MARGAERY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You call me forward?
16734,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Yes. We have some questions for you.
16735,MARGAERY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I am the queen.
16736,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," You are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest."
16737,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, How do you respond to these charges against your brother?
16738,MARGAERY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, They are lies.
16739,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, All of them?
16740,MARGAERY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, All of them.
16741,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?"
16742,MARGAERY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Yes, I swear it."
16743,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Thank you, your grace."
16744,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Do you know this man?
16745,OLYVAR,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden."
16746,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, How did you come to meet?
16747,OLYVAR,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.
16748,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, And what occurred in his chamber?
16749,OLYVAR,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, We engaged in intimate relations.
16750,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You laid with him?
16751,OLYVAR,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, That night and many others.
16752,LORAS,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Liar! He’s a liar!
16753,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Is there anyone else who can support your claim?
16754,OLYVAR,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn’t seem surprised."
16755,CERSEI,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
16756,OLYVAR,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne."
16757,LORAS,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Liar!
16758,OLENNA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, What are you doing? Let us pass.
16759,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.
16760,MARGAERY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, What?
16761,SPARROW,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her.
16762,MARGAERY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Tommen! Tommen!
16763,MARGAERY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," You can’t do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you!"
16764,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, What do you want?
16765,MYRANDA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don’t you?"
16766,MYRANDA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," You’re so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others."
16767,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, What others?
16768,MYRANDA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I shouldn’t gossip. It’s good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.
16769,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, What others?
16770,MYRANDA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Let’s see. There was Kiera. The blacksmith’s daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and… Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don’t they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt."
16771,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Hunt?
16772,MYRANDA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Mm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But it’s your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?"
16773,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, What was your name again?
16774,MYRANDA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Myranda.
16775,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," And how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can’t frighten me."
16776,MYRANDA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Are you done with your bath, my lady?"
16777,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Go. I can finish on my own.
16778,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Yes?
16779,THEON,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," I’ve come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady. If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?"
16780,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, No.
16781,THEON,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm."
16782,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I’m not touching you.
16783,THEON,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Please. He’ll punish me.
16784,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Do you think I care what he does to you.
16785,ROOSE,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Who comes before the Old Gods this night?
16786,THEON,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her?"
16787,RAMSAY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Ramsay of House Bolton. Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell. Who gives her?
16788,THEON,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Theon of House Greyjoy. Who was… who was her father’s ward.
16789,ROOSE,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Lady Sansa, will you take this man?"
16790,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, I take this man.
16791,RAMSAY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Are you pleased my lady?
16792,RAMSAY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Good. I want you to be happy. My father said you’re still a virgin.
16793,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Yes.
16794,RAMSAY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves?
16795,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me."
16796,RAMSAY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You’re not lying to me?
16797,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," No, my lord."
16798,RAMSAY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don’t you think?"
16799,SANSA,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Yes sir.
16800,RAMSAY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Good. Now take off your clothes.
16801,RAMSAY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95," Oh, no no no. You stay here Reek. You watch. (to Sansa) Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time."
16802,RAMSAY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, Reek? I told you to watch.
16803,RAMSAY,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_95, You’ve known Sansa since she was a girl. Now watch her become a woman.
16804,JON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black."
16805,ALLISER,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all of the Brothers that have died fighting the wildlings."
16806,JON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," As always, thank you for your honesty."
16807,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Safe travels, Lord Commander."
16808,JON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Thank you, Sam."
16809,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Oh, and…"
16810,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, It’s Dragonglass. It’s what I used to kill the White Walker. I hope you don’t need them.
16811,JON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Me too.
16812,AEMON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, There he is. That laugh. Egg! Egg laughed like that. One of the first things I remember about him.
16813,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," His little brother, Aegon. He became king."
16814,AEMON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," And before that, he was a jolly fellow. Like this one."
16815,AEMON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Get him south, Gillyflower. Before it’s too late."
16816,SANSA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Theon, wait."
16817,THEON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Not Theon, my lady. Reek."
16818,SANSA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Help me.
16819,THEON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You’re his wife now.
16820,SANSA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Theon
16821,THEON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Do what he says. Do what he says or he’ll hurt you.
16822,SANSA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, He already hurts me every night. All day I’m locked in this room and every night he comes. It can’t be worse.
16823,THEON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, It can. It can always be worse.
16824,SANSA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, What did he do to you?
16825,THEON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Please…
16826,SANSA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You betrayed my family!
16827,THEON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’m sorry. I’m sorry!
16828,SANSA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You have to help me!
16829,THEON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, He’ll see us. You don’t know him.
16830,SANSA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," My family still has friends in the North. All I have to do is give a signal and they’ll rescue me. Climb to the top of the Broken Tower, light this candle, and put it in the window. Promise me, Theon."
16831,THEON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Reek, my lady, Reek!"
16832,SANSA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Your name is Theon Greyjoy. Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, do you hear me? Theon. Promise me."
16833,RAMSAY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Yes, Reek?"
16834,AEMON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Egg! Egg! Mothers looking for you! Egg!
16835,GILLY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Get some sleep, Sam. You’ll have to speak for him tomorrow."
16836,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You don’t know that.
16837,GILLY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Get some sleep. I’ll watch over him.
16838,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’ll stay too. He’s always been good to me. I can’t leave him now.
16839,AEMON,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Egg! Egg.. I dreamed... that I was old
16840,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," His name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from King’s Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn. And a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended."
16841,BROTHERS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, And now his watch has ended.
16842,ALLISER,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," You’re losing all your friends, Tarly."
16843,RAMSAY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, My beautiful wife.
16844,RAMSAY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," When my father told me we were marrying I half expected a fat, bearded beast. Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you? You’ve made me very happy."
16845,RAMSAY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell. He’s a respected commander. His troops are loyal and battle tested. He’s hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army. But this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners. Our people are used to fighting in frost. His army’s out there now, suffering in the snow. One day I’ll be Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North. You’ll be my Lady and Wardeness."
16846,SANSA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, But isn’t your step mother pregnant?
16847,RAMSAY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, What of it?
16848,SANSA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, What happens if she has a boy?
16849,RAMSAY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Then I’ll have a baby brother.
16850,SANSA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, But he’ll be the heir.
16851,RAMSAY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’m Lord Bolton’s eldest son.
16852,SANSA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," But you’re a bastard, a true born will always have the stronger claim."
16853,RAMSAY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’ve been naturalized by a royal decree of--
16854,SANSA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Tommen Baratheon. Another bastard.
16855,RAMSAY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Bastards can rise high in the world. Like your half-brother Jon Snow. Born The Bastard of Winterfell, now the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch."
16856,RAMSAY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," You didn’t know? Yes, he’s done very well for himself. Ah. I near forgot why I asked you to join me. Come, my lady."
16857,RAMSAY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Your Northern friend. Reek told me you wanted to leave.
16858,RAMSAY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Why? Winterfell is your home and I am your husband.
16859,RAMSAY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Tough old bird. Everyone talks when I start beating them. But this one. Her heart gave out before I got to her face. We do breed them tough in the North. Bring my wife back to her chamber. It’s far too cold out here for a lady. You should hold on to your candles. The nights are so long now.
16860,DAVOS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, 40 horses died in the night. We’ll lose more come sunset. We’re running out of food. We can’t open the supply line until the snow clears.
16861,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, What else?
16862,DAVOS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, The Stormcrows rode off last night.
16863,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, 500 men.
16864,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Sell swords, loyal to nothing but gold."
16865,DAVOS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, We still have a hard march to Wintefell and we won’t be marching anywhere in this weather.
16866,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, And?
16867,DAVOS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," This isn’t our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears."
16868,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," I retreated from King’s Landing, Ser Davos. If I retreat again, I become “The King Who Ran.”"
16869,DAVOS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Your Grace..
16870,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Winter is coming. Those arent just the Stark words, it’s a fact. If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black. And who can say how many years this winter will last."
16871,DAVOS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, It’s better to wait for the right time than to risk everything.
16872,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," This is the right time, and I will risk everything. Because if I don't, we’ve lost. We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward,"
16873,DAVOS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Your Grace. (leaves)
16874,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," I’ve trusted in your visions, in your prophecies for years."
16875,MELISANDRE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames. A great battle in the snow."
16876,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I don’t know what I saw.
16877,MELISANDRE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You do know. Trust yourself.
16878,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," And you, do you trust yourself?"
16879,MELISANDRE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I trust in the Lord.
16880,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Are you sure?
16881,MELISANDRE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground.
16882,MELISANDRE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The Usurper Robb Stark. The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
16883,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, We don’t have Robert’s bastard here.
16884,MELISANDRE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," No, we have someone better, and your blood runs through her veins."
16885,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Have you lost your mind?
16886,MELISANDRE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Do you doubt me still? After all that you’ve seen?
16887,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, There must be another way. Leeches or something.
16888,MELISANDRE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, There is only one way. You must become king before the Long Night begins. Only you can lead the living against the dead. All your life has led us to this moment. To this decision.
16889,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, She’s my daughter.
16890,STANNIS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Get out.
16891,DERRYK,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, The beauty from beyond The Wall.
16892,BRAND,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Where are you going, huh? Aren’t we better looking than the fat man?"
16893,DERRYK,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," The question is, is she pretty down south in the real world, or is she pretty because she’s the only girl here?"
16894,BRAND,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Even in White Harbor, I’d want a kiss."
16895,DERRYK,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Come on love, give us a kiss."
16896,GILLY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Leave me alone.
16897,DERRYK,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, If you were my girl I wouldn’t leave you alone.
16898,BRAND,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, One little kiss.
16899,DERRYK,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Come on, give him a kiss."
16900,BRAND,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, A man gets lonely guarding the Wall.
16901,BRAND,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, There’s no need to be rude.
16902,DERRYK,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, We just want a little affection.
16903,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Get your hands off her. Brother Derryk. Brother Brand. I believe you both have guard duty tonight.
16904,BRAND,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Sam the Slayer. Are you gonna slay me with that sword?
16905,DERRYK,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Look at his hands shaking.
16906,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Gilly go on, Get back to your room and lock the door."
16907,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’m warning you.
16908,DERRYK,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Come on! Come on!
16909,DERRYK,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," You lying sack of shit! Killed a White Walker, eh? You fatass fuck. Come on, get up. (to Gilly) He’s your hero. He’s a hog!"
16910,GILLY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Leave him alone!
16911,DERRYK,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Stubborn little wilding bitch aren’t ya?
16912,GILLY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Sam! Sam! Sam!
16913,BRAND,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Alright. Hold still.
16914,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I said get your hands off her.
16915,BRAND,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You’re gonna get yourself killed.
16916,DERRYK,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Roll over. Jon Snow’s not here to save you.
16917,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I killed a White Walker. I killed a Thenn. I’ll take my chances with you.
16918,GILLY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Sam!
16919,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’m alright.
16920,GILLY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You’re not.
16921,SAMMY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Just a bit woozy.
16922,GILLY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, The next time you see something like that you leave it alone.
16923,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I will not. They would’ve… I don’t know what they would have done
16924,GILLY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn’t come.
16925,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, No. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.
16926,GILLY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Don’t be stupid Sam, you’re not a fighter."
16927,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?
16928,GILLY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Just promise me that whatever happens you’ll take care of little Sam.
16929,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Of course I will. And I’ll take care of you, too."
16930,GILLY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I need more water.
16931,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Stay. Please.
16932,GILLY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Am I hurting you?
16933,GILLY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Are you sure?
16934,SAM,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Oh. Oh my.
16935,MALKO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends. Not your usual street tough old drunken pirate. This one’s a Westerosi knight from an ancient house, trained in sword and lance. he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Bidding begins at 12 gold honors."
16936,MALKO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, 13. Do I have 14?
16937,MALKO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, 15? 15 golds honors. Do I have 16?
16938,SLAVE BUYER,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, 20.
16939,MALKO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Sold!
16940,TYRION,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Wait! You have to buy me as well.
16941,BUYER,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Why?
16942,TYRION,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," We’re a team. I’m a great fighter, too."
16943,MALKO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, He’s funny. You have to give him that.
16944,BUYER,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Alright. He’s funny.
16945,TYRION,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Thank you my Lord. Thank you.
16946,BUYER,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Yes.
16947,TYRION,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," My Lord, if I may. I’ve heard Mereen’s become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…"
16948,BUER,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Here’s your wages, funny man. It’ll last the rest of your life."
16949,DAARIO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?
16950,DAENERYS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Don’t be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he’s smart enough to understand that.
16951,DAARIO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.
16952,DAENERYS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Are you jealous?
16953,DAARIO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Do you think I’m petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?
16954,DAENERYS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I do.
16955,DAARIO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You’re right. My motivations are entirely impure.
16956,DAARIO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Doesn’t make me wrong.
16957,DAENERYS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," You told me yourself, I can’t fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice."
16958,DAARIO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Everyone has a choice. Even slaves have a choice. Death or slavery.
16959,DAENERYS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, So what else can I do?
16960,DAARIO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Marry me instead.
16961,DAENERYS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn’t."
16962,DAARIO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Why not? You’re our queen, you can do as you like."
16963,DAENERYS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, No. I can’t
16964,DAARIO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Then you are the only person in Mereen who’s not free.
16965,DAARIO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," I know I’m here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?"
16966,DAENERYS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Of course
16967,DAARIO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all."
16968,DAENERYS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I am a queen. Not a butcher.
16969,DAARIO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, All rulers are either butchers or meat.
16970,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he’s got."
16971,HIGH SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," It’s not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I’ll admit."
16972,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.
16973,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You should have the decency to kneel before the gods
16974,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Don’t spar with me little fellow.
16975,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," For me, it’s the knees. You?"
16976,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Hips.
16977,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Huh.
16978,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," A man of the people, is that your game? It’s an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei’s dirty work for her."
16979,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, The people always do the dirty work.
16980,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away."
16981,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, A useful talent.
16982,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’m here for my grandson and granddaughter.
16983,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished."
16984,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Don’t you walk away from me.
16985,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," You don’t give commands here, Lady Olenna."
16986,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, What is it you want? Gold? I’ll make you the richest septon who ever lived.
16987,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, What then?
16988,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I’m telling you a simple truth"
16989,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
16990,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don’t have one in your library I’ll give you my own.
16991,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’ve read the seven pointed star.
16992,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Then you’ll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.
16993,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?"
16994,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Yes. The Gods’ laws must be applied to all equally.
16995,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," If it’s equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I’ll make sure the hungry know who to blame,"
16996,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few…"
16997,SQUIRE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Lady Olenna.
16998,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love."
16999,TOMMEN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, She’s in a prison cell and there’s nothing I can do. I am the king! The queen is in prison and there’s nothing I can do!
17000,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control."
17001,TOMMEN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’ll call in the army. I’ll take back the sept and kill every last one of them. I’ll start a war if I have to.
17002,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.
17003,TOMMEN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I love her. I love her. I can’t help her.
17004,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.
17005,TOMMEN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I will speak to the high sparrow. There must be something--
17006,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
17007,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Your happiness is all I want in this world
17008,TOMMEN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I know.
17009,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," No you don’t. You can’t possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy."
17010,AREO,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess’s wellbeing.
17011,MYRCELLA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You looked different when I left. You had more hair.
17012,JAIME,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, And more hands. How’s Trystane?
17013,MYRCELLA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, He’ll be alright.
17014,JAIME,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’m sorry for that. It wasn’t supposed to happen that way.
17015,MYRCELLA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Why is it happening at all?
17016,JAIME,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Your mother’s worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I’ve come to take you home.
17017,MYRCELLA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," This is my home, this has been my home for years. I didn’t want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now she’s forcing me to go back?"
17018,JAIME,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.
17019,MYRCELLA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," It’s not complicated at all, it’s simple. I love Trystane, I’m going to marry him, and we’re staying right here."
17020,JAIME,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I don’t understand.
17021,MYRCELLA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Of course you don’t! You don’t know me!
17022,BRONN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman’s taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife! Yes I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife!"
17023,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, He’s got a good voice.
17024,OBARA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, We’re lucky he’s a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble.
17025,BRONN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, It’s against my code to hurt a woman.
17026,OBARA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, It’s amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.
17027,BRONN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I wouldn’t say you beat me.
17028,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, How’s your arm?
17029,BRONN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Wonderful. Wouldn’t feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
17030,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You think you’re leaving Dorne?
17031,BRONN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
17032,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Thank you.
17033,BRONN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I said Dornish women. I didn’t say you.
17034,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’m not the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen?
17035,BRONN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’ve seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.
17036,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Name one more beautiful than I am.
17037,BRONN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Well now, in King’s Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous..."
17038,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, There was a what? In King’s Landing you were saying.
17039,BRONN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Was I?
17040,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, There was a woman more beautiful than I am.
17041,BRONN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Was there? My memory’s not what it was earlier.
17042,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, How’s your arm now?
17043,BRONN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.
17044,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, And how about your head?
17045,BRONN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, My head… You don’t even wanna know what’s going on in…
17046,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Your nose is bleeding.
17047,BRONN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, It’s nothing. It’s the dry air.
17048,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death."
17049,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, The only antidote. Who’s the most beautiful woman in the world?
17050,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Sorry? Who?
17051,BRONN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You.
17052,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Don’t drop it.
17053,TYENE,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I think you’re very handsome as well.
17054,BAELISH,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’m sorry about the locale.
17055,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, No you’re not.
17056,BAELISH,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, It felt like the safest place.
17057,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Not for your clientele, clearly."
17058,BAELISH,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn’t exist until we invented them."
17059,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," You’ve always been rather impressed with yourself, haven’t you?"
17060,BAELISH,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, The past is the past. The future is all that’s worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
17061,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Don’t pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you’d return to the capital once things started going wrong."
17062,BAELISH,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I promise you..
17063,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they’ll never even find what’s left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?"
17064,BAELISH,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Cersei summoned me to King’s Landing. I dared not refuse her.
17065,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, And what did she want?
17066,BAELISH,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."
17067,OLENNA,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, What kind of gift?
17068,BAELISH,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.
17069,SLAVE OWNER,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something."
17070,OWNER,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," You and you, you, you two, you, you, and you."
17071,OWNER,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Valar morghulis.
17072,MEN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Valar dohaeris.
17073,OWNER,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Prepare yourselves.
17074,DAENERYS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.
17075,HIZDAHR,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence."
17076,OWNER,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Move yourselves!
17077,OWNER,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Your Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all.
17078,OWNER,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," “We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
17079,MEN,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," “We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
17080,DAENERYS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I think I’ve seen enough.
17081,HIZDAHR,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Your Grace, it’s a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged."
17082,DAENERYS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’ve sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
17083,TYRION,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, What are you doing?
17084,DAENERYS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Get him out of my sight.
17085,JORAH,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift."
17086,TYRION,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, It’s true. He has.
17087,DAENERYS,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Who are you?
17088,TYRION,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," I am the gift. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister."
17089,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It’s quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."
17090,MARGAERY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I know you did this.
17091,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
17092,MARGAERY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You’re not very good at those, I’m afraid. Perhaps that’s why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me."
17093,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You’re upset. You’re not thinking clearly. I’ll visit again when you’ve had a chance to calm down.
17094,MARGAERY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I don’t want to see you again.
17095,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," I do hope you change your mind about that. I’ve been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."
17096,MARGAERY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Leave.
17097,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Yes, I’m afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever."
17098,MARGAERY,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Get out you hateful bitch!
17099,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," Sleep well, sister."
17100,HIGH SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Thank you. (to Cersei) You saw her?
17101,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Yes.
17102,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, And?
17103,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
17104,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
17105,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Who will stand judge?
17106,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
17107,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Will you be one of them?
17108,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I will.
17109,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
17110,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Then they will be at The Mother’s mercy.
17111,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, What does The Mother’s mercy entail?
17112,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."
17113,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
17114,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King’s Landing?
17115,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I think I may have heard at one point.
17116,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.
17117,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Who carved this altar do you know?
17118,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, I’m afraid i don’t.
17119,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, No one does. There’s no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn’t inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.
17120,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96," A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird."
17121,SPARROW,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, And he has much to say about you.
17122,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Move. Let me go immediately.
17123,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!
17124,CERSEI,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_96, Look at me. Look at my face. It’s the last thing you’ll see before you die.
17125,JORAH,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97," Your Grace, I want to say--"
17126,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
17127,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, If only I were otherwise.
17128,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn’t I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
17129,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
17130,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
17131,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It’s too soon to know if you deserve my service.
17132,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, If you’d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
17133,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97," When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
17134,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
17135,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
17136,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, I have a very large army and very large dragons.
17137,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
17138,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, So you want to advise me. Very well. (looks to Jorah) What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
17139,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, I know.
17140,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, Why should the people trust a queen who can’t keep her promises?
17141,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97," Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can’t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
17142,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
17143,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97," Yes, many opportunities."
17144,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, And did he?
17145,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, No. Not until forced to do so.
17146,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97," He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
17147,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, So I should kill him?
17148,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97," A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you’re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you’re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
17149,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
17150,SEPTA,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, Confess.
17151,CERSEI,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, My son. Let me speak to--
17152,SEPTA,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, Confess. I meant it.
17153,CERSEI,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97, My face will be the last thing you see before--
17154,ARYA,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_97," My name is Lana. I’m an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more."
17155,ARYA,5,48,hardhome,EXT. BRAAVOS - MARKET_1," Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"
17156,ARYA,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade."
17157,JAQEN,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.
17158,ARYA,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, How will she serve him?
17159,JAQEN,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
17160,ARYA,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, What will she do there?
17161,JAQEN,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, She will see.
17162,ARYA,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, See what?
17163,JAQEN,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her."
17164,ARYA,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Oysters, clams and cockles!"
17165,ARYA,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
17166,THIN MAN,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Your oysters fresh?
17167,ARYA,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Best in the city.
17168,THIN MAN,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You wouldn’t lie to an old man would you?
17169,THIN MAN,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.
17170,MAN,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, It’s my 18th voyage. I’ve returned from all of them without a scratch on me.
17171,THIN MAN,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Can’t do it.
17172,MAN,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don’t understand?"
17173,JAQEN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
17174,ARYA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
17175,JAQEN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, A girl tells a man that she has seen.
17176,ARYA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money."
17177,JAQEN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn’t have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?"
17178,ARYA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, The Many Faced God. You said you didn’t know what I would see at the docks.
17179,JAQEN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
17180,ARYA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, And then what?
17181,JAQEN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, A gift for the Thin Man.
17182,WAIF,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, She is not ready.
17183,JAQEN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Perhaps she is, perhaps she’s not."
17184,WAIF,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, And if she’s not?
17185,JAQEN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, It is all the same to the Many Faced God.
17186,QYBURN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.
17187,CERSEI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, The charges?
17188,QYBURN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert."
17189,CERSEI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, All lies.
17190,QYBURN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you’ll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason."
17191,CERSEI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I wish you’d said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
17192,QYBURN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," I’m afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council."
17193,CERSEI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Tell him I need to speak to him.
17194,QYBURN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I implored him to visit you but he would not.
17195,CERSEI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
17196,QYBURN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Your arrest, and Queen Margaery’s arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched."
17197,CERSEI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
17198,QYBURN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," I tried my grace, he wouldn’t see me. He wouldn’t see anyone."
17199,CERSEI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I can’t stay here.
17200,QYBURN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," There is a way, Your Grace. A way out."
17201,CERSEI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won’t. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness."
17202,QYBURN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Goodbye my queen. The work continues.
17203,SANSA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Why. Why Theon.
17204,THEON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
17205,SANSA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?"
17206,THEON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
17207,SANSA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Good. If it weren’t for you I’d still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would."
17208,THEON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
17209,THEON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," They weren’t “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you’d know them since they were born."
17210,THEON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, They weren’t. They were only--
17211,SANSA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Only what?
17212,THEON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I can’t..
17213,SANSA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Tell me!
17214,THEON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," I can’t, not unless the master says..."
17215,SANSA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Tell me, they weren’t what?!"
17216,THEON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, They weren’t...
17217,THEON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, They weren’t Bran and Rickon! I couldn’t find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
17218,SANSA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You didn’t…?
17219,SANSA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
17220,THEON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I can’t talk to you anymore.
17221,SANSA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--"
17222,THEON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Not Theon, Reek!"
17223,BOLTON BANNERMAN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Our scouts tells us he’s got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however."
17224,ROOSE,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," And how high can Stannis’ horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny."
17225,ROOSE,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You disagree?
17226,RAMSAY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Stannis isn’t from the North. You are, father. I think you’re missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders."
17227,ROOSE,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, And what do you recommend?
17228,RAMSAY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows."
17229,ROOSE,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can’t touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn’t get an army through if we wanted to.
17230,RAMSAY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I don’t need an army. I need 20 good men.
17231,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, So have you decided yet? Whether I’m worthy of your service?
17232,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Have you decided yet whether you’re going to have me killed?
17233,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, It’s probably my safest option.
17234,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I can see why you would think so. It’s what your father would have done.
17235,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, And what would your father do?
17236,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I’d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
17237,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Is that why you killed him?
17238,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Some day if you decide not to execute me, I’ll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we’ll need more wine than this."
17239,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
17240,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
17241,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I’m terrible?
17242,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I’ve heard stories.
17243,DANERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
17244,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
17245,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Which kind is that?
17246,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
17247,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
17248,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"  Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
17249,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Perhaps it won’t come to that.
17250,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, It’s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
17251,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Varys? King Robert’s spy master?
17252,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
17253,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
17254,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn’t have to do. I suspect he’s the main reason you weren’t slaughtered in your crib.
17255,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, But you trust him?
17256,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
17257,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, The brother who killed my father.
17258,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, That’s the one.
17259,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
17260,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
17261,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I’m not going to kill you.
17262,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, No? Banish me?
17263,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, No.
17264,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," So if I’m not going to be murdered, and I’m not going to be banished..."
17265,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You’re going to advise me. (takes his wine cup) While you can still speak in complete sentences.
17266,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Advise you on what?
17267,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, How to get what I want.
17268,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
17269,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, If I want jokes I’ll get myself a proper fool.
17270,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I’m not entirely joking. There’s more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
17271,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I fought so that no child born into Slaver’s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
17272,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
17273,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, The common people.
17274,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen. Here in Slaver’s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won’t back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won’t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
17275,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They’re all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
17276,TYRION,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, It’s a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You’re not the first person to have dreamt it.
17277,DAENERYS,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I’m not going to stop the wheel. I’m going to break the wheel.
17278,JORAH,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.
17279,MASTER,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You struck me.
17280,JORAH,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I’ve been flogged if it makes you happy. I’m the best you’ve got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
17281,MASTER,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," You’re a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?"
17282,JORAH,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
17283,SEPTA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Thirsty? Confess.
17284,CERSEI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," I’ll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
17285,SEPTA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Confess.
17286,CERSEI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.
17287,SEPTA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Confess.
17288,CERSEI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die."
17289,GILLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Does it hurt?
17290,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, No.
17291,GILLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Good.
17292,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, How are you?
17293,GILLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I’m not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.
17294,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You know what I mean.
17295,GILLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I’m good.
17296,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Are you scared?
17297,GILLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, A little.
17298,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Me too.
17299,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Who’s there?
17300,OLLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Olly.
17301,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Come in.
17302,OLLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I heard what happened.
17303,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It’s only natural.
17304,OLLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Figured you were hungry.
17305,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You’re a good lad.
17306,OLLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Wanted to ask you something. (Olly looks at Gilly) If you’ve got the time.
17307,GILLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I need to check on baby Sam.
17308,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Now then. How can I help?
17309,OLLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, It’s about the Lord Commander.
17310,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Yes?
17311,OLLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, He’s going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.
17312,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, We’ve been fighting them for years.
17313,OLLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, This wasn’t a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why’s he saving them?
17314,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."
17315,OLLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," The one he’s travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village."
17316,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Olly...
17317,OLLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, How can he trust him?
17318,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," I’ve seen the army of the dead. I’ve seen the white walkers, and they’re coming for us, for all the living. And when it’s time we’ll need every last man we can find."
17319,OLLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?
17320,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Jon’s taking a risk, but he has to. We don’t stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
17321,OLLY,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You believe that?
17322,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, With all my heart.
17323,SAM,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Try not to worry Olly. I’ve been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.
17324,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You trust me Jon Snow?
17325,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Does that make me a fool?
17326,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, We are fools together now.
17327,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Lord of Bones. Been a long time.
17328,LORD OF BONES,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?
17329,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, War.
17330,LORD OF BONES,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.
17331,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.
17332,LORD OF BONES,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You don’t give the orders here.
17333,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I’m not giving an order.
17334,LORD OF BONES,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Why aren’t you in chains?
17335,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, He’s not my prisoner.
17336,LORD OF BONES,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, What is he?
17337,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, We’re allies.
17338,LORD OF BONES,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.
17339,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I don’t fight for the crows.
17340,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, We’re not here to fight. We’re here to talk.
17341,LORD OF BONES,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you’re done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--"
17342,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Gather the elders and let’s talk.
17343,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, My name’s Jon Snow. I’m Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. We’re not friends. We’ve never been friends. We won’t become friends today. This isn’t about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what’s out there.
17344,KARSI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You built that wall to keep us out.
17345,LOBODA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?
17346,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, In normal times we wouldn’t. But these aren’t normal times. The white walkers don’t care if a man’s Free Folk or Crow. We’re all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
17347,KARSI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe."
17348,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, It’s not a trick. It’s a gift for those who join us.
17349,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Dragonglass. A man of the Night’s Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
17350,LOBODA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You saw this?
17351,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, No. But I trust the man.
17352,KARSI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, There are old stories about Dragonglass.
17353,LOBODA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.
17354,KARSI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, And with the things we’ve seen you don’t believe them?
17355,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
17356,KARSI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Come with you where?
17357,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, There are good lands south of the wall.  The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
17358,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night’s Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We’re prepared to give you that new life."
17359,KARSI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, If…?
17360,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
17361,LOBODA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Where is Mance?
17362,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, He died.
17363,LOBODA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, How?
17364,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I put an arrow through his heart.
17365,LOBODA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.
17366,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt’s orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that’s what we need today"
17367,KARSI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows."
17368,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," I’m not asking you to forget your dead. I’ll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I’m asking you to think about your children now. They’ll never have children of their own if we don’t band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can’t stop them. The Night’s Watch can’t stop them. And all the southern kings can’t stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we’ll give the fuckers a fight."
17369,KARSI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," You vouch for this man, Tormund?"
17370,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," He’s prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He’s young, but he knows how to lead. He didn’t have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him."
17371,LOBODA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.
17372,KARSI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," So would mine, but fuck 'em, they’re dead."
17373,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, This is the way.
17374,WILDLING ELDER,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I’m with Tormund. We stay here we’re dead men. At least with King Crow there’s a chance.
17375,GIANT,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Tormund.
17376,LOBODA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they’re gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That’s our enemy. That has always been our enemy."
17377,KARSI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I fucking hate Thenns.
17378,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, How many are with us? 5000?
17379,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I’m not good at counting.
17380,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, We’re leaving too many behind.
17381,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.
17382,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, And he knew them better than I ever will.
17383,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, They’re running out of food and there’s nothing to hunt. They’ll come around.
17384,KARSI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Johnna is gonna look after you. She’s in charge, you listen to her."
17385,DAUGHTER,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, I wanna go with you.
17386,KARSI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," I need to get the old folks on the boats. I’m right behind you, I promise. (she kisses them on the forehead) Go on."
17387,WUN WUN,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Lokh kif rukh?
17388,LOBODA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Shut the gate.
17389,LOBODA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Shut the gate!!
17390,SHOUTING,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it!
17391,LOBODA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Ready your arrows!
17392,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Get in line! Get in line!
17393,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Hold the line! Hold the line!
17394,NIGHT’S WATCH BROTHER,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Lord Commander!
17395,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Get them to the ship and come back for me!
17396,BROTHER,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, But you’ll never make it--
17397,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Now!
17398,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You should be on one of those boats.
17399,KARSI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you’re not there ?
17400,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You have my word. I’ve given orders.
17401,KARSI,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Don’t think you’re gonna be there to enforce those orders !
17402,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," If they get through, everyone dies !"
17403,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Night’s Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!
17404,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, The Dragonglass!
17405,LOBODA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," You’re with me, lad! Now!"
17406,LOBODA,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Get the glass.
17407,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, The Dragonglass!
17408,EDD,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Fuck the glass! We’re gonna die here.
17409,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Go! Go! Go!
17410,TORMUND,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1," Wun Wun, to the sea."
17411,JON,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Let’s go now! Now!
17412,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--"
17413,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Horses?
17414,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," We’re still getting a count, but hundreds are dead."
17415,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
17416,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
17417,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Put last night’s guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them."
17418,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Unless there’s a thaw, we can’t press forward to Winterfell, and we don’t have enough food to get us back to Castle Black."
17419,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, We’re not returning to Castle Black.
17420,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can’t march forward, and we won’t march back…"
17421,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Have the dead horses butchered for meat.
17422,ALLISER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Open the gates.
17423,JON,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, It was a failure.
17424,SAM,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, It wasn’t.
17425,JON,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," I went to save them, I failed."
17426,SAM,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," You didn’t fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else."
17427,JON,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I don’t think that fact’s lost on them.
17428,ALLISER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed."
17429,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," You sent for me, Your Grace."
17430,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I’m sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I’ll make sure the Night’s Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes."
17431,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Your Grace, you’ve named me your Hand."
17432,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Yes.
17433,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," The King’s Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war."
17434,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," You’re not abandoning me, you’re obeying a command."
17435,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
17436,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn’t name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don’t come back empty handed."
17437,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me."
17438,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, My family stays with me.
17439,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.
17440,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, My family stays with me.
17441,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, What’s this one now?
17442,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," ""The Dance of Dragons"
17443,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Well that sounds like a proper story.
17444,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection."
17445,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield."
17446,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, And burnt him to a crisp.
17447,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess."
17448,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Do you like it?
17449,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, He’s beautiful.
17450,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Thank you.
17451,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You’re very welcome.
17452,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?"
17453,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Of course I will.
17454,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, But why am I getting a present?
17455,DAVOS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. (beat) I’ll be gone for a few days, Princess. I’ll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I’m back."
17456,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You’ll just have to read it yourself.
17457,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Prince Doran. (bows)
17458,DORAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit."
17459,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Princess Myrcella.
17460,MYRCELLA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Uncle.
17461,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, What a lovely dress.
17462,MYRCELLA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You don’t like it?
17463,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You must be cold.
17464,MYRCELLA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.
17465,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Prince Trystane. How’s your jaw?
17466,TRYSTANE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, A fleabite.
17467,ELLARIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, What are you doing in Dorne?
17468,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella."
17469,DORAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.
17470,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, We received a threatening message. The princess’s necklace in the jaws of a viper.
17471,MYRCELLA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, That necklace was stolen from my room.
17472,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
17473,DORAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, We can’t behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I’ve seen war. I’ve seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I’ve seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don’t want to lead my people into that hell.
17474,ELLARIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters."
17475,DORAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," And that is precisely what we are doing. (raises glass) Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms."
17476,DORAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, King Tommen insists on his sister’s return to the capital?
17477,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I’m afraid he does.
17478,DORAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," I cannot disobey my King’s command. (Ellaria glares at Doran) She will return with you to King’s Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand."
17479,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I accept.
17480,DORAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council."
17481,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You have my word.
17482,ELLARIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, The word of a Kingslayer.
17483,ELLARIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, No wonder you can’t stand. You have no spine.
17484,DORAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won’t."
17485,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, May I inquire into the fate of my man?
17486,DORAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King’s Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?"
17487,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it’s me.
17488,DORAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he’s to rule one day. I’ll let him decide.
17489,TRYSTANE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.
17490,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You’re a good man.
17491,TRYSTANE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, On one condition.
17492,NYMERIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Why do we play? I’m better than you, I’ll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don’t think, I can’t recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- (slaps) -- pain? That one hurt didn’t it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister."
17493,TYENE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You’re going to miss.
17494,NYMERIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I never miss.
17495,TYENE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You will. You’re thinking too much. Now you’re nervous. “What if she’s right?”
17496,NYMERIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Luck.
17497,TYENE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Now it’s my turn.
17498,NYMERIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You’re too slow. You’ve always been too slow.
17499,BRONN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?
17500,AREO,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You’ll find out very soon.
17501,TYENE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?"
17502,BRONN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, The most beautiful woman in the world.
17503,TYENE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, And that’s the truth!
17504,NYMERIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Slut.
17505,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
17506,DORAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, 
17507,BRONN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Only the one.
17508,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I believe you’ve already met Prince Trystane.
17509,BRONN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Prince. Sorry about the other day.
17510,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He’s agreed to grant you your freedom.
17511,BRONN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I’m glad to hear it. The pie looks good.
17512,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, There was one condition.
17513,DORAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Perhaps some soup instead?
17514,ARYA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--"
17515,MAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, How much for your little clam?
17516,ARYA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!"
17517,THIN MAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Come on.
17518,THIN MAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Some oysters, girl! I’m talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!"
17519,BANKER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free."
17520,MACE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.
17521,BANKER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, And how goes the harvest in the Reach?
17522,MACE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I’ll be sure to send the Arbor’s finest your way."
17523,BANKER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I’m afraid I don’t partake.
17524,MACE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course."
17525,BANKER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.
17526,MACE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.
17527,BANKER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Most unfortunate for the glovers.
17528,MACE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble."
17529,BANKER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell."
17530,MACE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You are the world's best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.
17531,BANKER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I’m afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
17532,MACE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?"
17533,BANKER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I don't have that gift.
17534,MACE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," It's not a gift, it’s a skill, anyone can learn it. “So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown…”"
17535,MERYN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I thought that old shit would never stop singing.
17536,MAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," It wasn’t bad, though."
17537,MERYN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king."
17538,MERYN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos."
17539,MAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You’re buying?
17540,MERYN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Oh, I’m buying. But I never was good at sharing."
17541,BROTHEL KEEPER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Sell your fish somewhere else.
17542,PROSTITUTE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Oh let her in, Brusco, I’m hungry. Come here, sweetness."
17543,PROSTITUTE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, They say oyster’s get the juices flowing. We’ll take half a dozen.
17544,ARYA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Three coppers.
17545,JOHN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Here’s a silver because the lady likes you.
17546,MERYN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Too old.
17547,HEAD PROSTITUTE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Brea.
17548,MERYN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Too old.
17549,HEAD,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," I have just the one. Anara our most expensive girl, but well worth it, I assure you."
17550,MERYN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Too old.
17551,MERYN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Do you have what I want or not?
17552,HEAD,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Of course. Of course.
17553,MAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry."
17554,MAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.
17555,MAN 2,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I’ll have one.
17556,HEAD,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo!
17557,MERYN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Good.
17558,MERYN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I’ll tell you when we’re done.
17559,MERYN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You’ll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.
17560,HEAD,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Of course.
17561,HEAD,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," I’ll have you whipped, girl! Go on!"
17562,MAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Valaar morghulis.
17563,JAQEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, And?
17564,ARYA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, The Thin Man wasn’t hungry today.
17565,JAQEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Perhaps that’s why the man is thin.
17566,ARYA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Tomorrow.
17567,JAQEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Tomorrow.
17568,JAQEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, A girl has work to do.
17569,DORAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die."
17570,DORAN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I believe in second chances. I don’t believe in third chances.
17571,ELLARIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You write like a 7 year old.
17572,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
17573,ELLARIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, He didn’t try to make you pay?
17574,ELLARIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Then maybe he’s changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you’ll be bringing her daughter home
17575,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, She will.
17576,ELLARIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," You love her very much, don’t you?"
17577,JAIME,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Of course, she’s my niece."
17578,ELLARIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I wasn’t talking about her.
17579,ELLARIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen.  It’s always changing, who we’re supposed to love and who we’re not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want."
17580,ELLARIA,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.
17581,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Father. Aren’t you cold?
17582,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, No. What are you reading?
17583,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, The Dance of Dragons.
17584,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, What’s it about?
17585,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," It’s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered."
17586,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, “The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
17587,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, That’s just what they call it.
17588,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Doesn’t make much sense.
17589,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I think it’s poetic.
17590,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?"
17591,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I wouldn’t have chosen either. It’s all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
17592,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it."
17593,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," It’s alright, father."
17594,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You don’t even know what I’m talking about.
17595,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, It doesn’t matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?
17596,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Yes there is.
17597,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Good, I want to. I’m the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I’m your daughter."
17598,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Forgive me.
17599,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Where’s my father? I want to see my father.
17600,MELISANDRE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," It will all be over soon, Princess."
17601,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Where’s my father? No you can’t do this, father where are you?!"
17602,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!"
17603,SELYSE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, It’s what the Lord wants. It’s a good thing. A great thing.
17604,MELISANDRE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way."
17605,SELYSE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," If we don’t act then we’ll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice…"
17606,MELISANDRE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!"
17607,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!"
17608,SELYSE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I can’t.
17609,STANNIS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, There’s no other way. She has King’s blood.
17610,MELISANDRE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!"
17611,SHIREEN,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Mother, don’t do this please! Please help! Don’t do this! Please, father! Mother, help!"
17612,SELYSE,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, No...
17613,DAENERYS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Where have you been?
17614,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Just making sure everything’s in order.
17615,ANNOUNCER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games!"
17616,ANNOUNCER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," My queen, our first contest. Who will triumph"
17617,QUICK,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."
17618,STRONG,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."
17619,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, They’re waiting for you. Clap your hands.
17620,DAARIO,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," That one, the smaller man, no question, that’s where you should put your money."
17621,TYRION,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, The smaller man it is.
17622,DAENERYS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I’m not putting my money anywhere.
17623,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
17624,DAARIO,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. (looks at Hizdahr) He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.
17625,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not."
17626,DAENERYS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?"
17627,DAARIO,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn’t get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here (he puts a dagger to his neck) or here (he puts the dagger to Hizdahr’s neck). And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren’t. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy."
17628,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You don’t approve?
17629,TYRION,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, There’s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
17630,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Fair enough, yet -- it’s an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?"
17631,TYRION,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, It’s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
17632,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, I’m not talking about myself. I’m talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.
17633,DAENERYS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, That is greatness?
17634,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
17635,TYRION,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, My father would have liked you.
17636,ANNOUNCER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, We ask again
17637,DAENERYS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
17638,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, At your command?
17639,DAENERYS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, If need be.
17640,ANNOUNCER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, A Meereenese champion?
17641,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, How many people will die to make this happen?
17642,DAENERYS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
17643,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Those men think they’re dying for a good reason.
17644,DAENERYS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Someone else’s reason.
17645,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don’t know their own minds, but you do."
17646,TYRION,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Well said, you’re an eloquent man. Doesn’t mean you’re wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles."
17647,ANNOUNCER,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, ...or a Westerosi Knight?!
17648,JORAH,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen."
17649,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Your Grace--
17650,DAARIO,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Shut your mouth.
17651,TYRION,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You can end this.
17652,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, She cannot.
17653,TYRION,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, You can!
17654,DAARIO,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Protect your queen!
17655,HIZDAHR,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way--"
17656,TYRION,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Stay close!
17657,JORAH,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, This way!
17658,DAARIO,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98," The other side, follow me!"
17659,DAARIO,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Protect your queen!
17660,DAENERYS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Drogon!
17661,DAENERYS,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_98, Valahd..
17662,MELISANDRE,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99," The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king. His fires have melted the snows away. The way ahead is clear."
17663,STANNIS,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, We ride for Winterfell.
17664,MELISANDRE,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, And you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right.
17665,SOLDIER,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Your Grace.
17666,STANNIS,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Prepare to form up.
17667,SOLDIER,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Your Grace.
17668,STANNIS,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Tell me.
17669,SOLDIER,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, The men. Many deserted before dawn.
17670,STANNIS,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, How many?
17671,SOLDIER,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99," Nearly half. All the sell-swords, with all the horses."
17672,SOLDIER 2,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Your Grace?
17673,STANNIS,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Speak up. It can’t be worse than mutiny.
17674,STANNIS,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Cut her down.
17675,SOLDIER,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Your Grace. The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.
17676,STANNIS,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.
17677,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99," He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world."
17678,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, So what are you gonna do?
17679,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, I’m gonna hope they don’t learn how to climb the wall.
17680,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, But… the Dragonglass?
17681,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99," No one’s ever getting that back, now. It wouldn’t have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it."
17682,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, But… you killed a White Walker.
17683,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…
17684,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, He’s made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
17685,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Not enough. (pause) The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How’s it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black? (smiles)
17686,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn’t winning any elections back then.
17687,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Here’s to us then. Long may they sneer.
17688,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, What?
17689,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99," I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That’s what I’m meant to be, not this."
17690,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99," I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who’s left to give me advice I trust?"
17691,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99," Well, there’s Edd."
17692,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99," I’ll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon’s gone. The Citadel has the world’s greatest library. I’ll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come."
17693,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99," If Gilly stays here then she’ll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I’ll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I’ll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. (pause) I’d rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that."
17694,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Thank you.
17695,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99," You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too."
17696,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, They’ll bloody try.
17697,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Sam?
17698,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, What?
17699,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Sam…
17700,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, You’ve just been beaten half to death. How did you--
17701,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Very carefully.
17702,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, I’m glad the end of the world’s working out for someone.
17703,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, I’ll come back.
17704,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, To your return.
17705,SAM,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, To my return.
17706,PODRICK,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, My lady! Stannis. Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.
17707,BRIENNE,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, How do you know it’s Stannis?
17708,PODRICK,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, He’s carrying his flaming heart banners. From the Blackwater. I’ll never forget it.
17709,STANNIS,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Trench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. And send out a foraging party immediately. The siege begins at sunrise.
17710,SOLDIER,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99," There’s not going to be a siege, Your Grace."
17711,STANNIS,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, Bolton has women fighting for him.
17712,BRIENNE,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, I do not fight for the Boltons. I’m Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?
17713,STANNIS,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99, I did.
17714,BRIENNE,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99," In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?"
17715,STANNIS,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_99," Go on, do your duty."
17716,RAMSAY,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Looks like we’re done here.
17717,SURVIVOR,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, I surrender. I surrender!
17718,RAMSAY,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, And I accept your surrender.
17719,RAMSAY,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Let’s head back. My wife must be lonely.
17720,MYRANDA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, My lady. I have come to escort you back to your chamber.
17721,THEON,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Go with her. Please.
17722,SANSA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1," I know what Ramsay is. I know what he’ll do to me. (looks to Theon) If I’m going to die, let it happen while there’s some of me left."
17723,MYRANDA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1," Die? (lowers the bow) Who said anything about dying? You can’t die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn’t need all of you. Just the parts he’ll use to make his heir. Until you’ve given him a boy or two and he’s finished using them. (raises bow) He’s got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?"
17724,MYRANDA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, You’re leaving it to me? Good. Let’s begin.
17725,MYRANDA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Stop! Stop!
17726,MAN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Open the gates!
17727,THEON,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, He’s coming back.
17728,MERYN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, I can see I have my work cut out for me.You two. Out.
17729,ARYA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1," You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I’ve gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I’m glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?"
17730,ARYA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, I can’t hear you.
17731,ARYA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, You know who I am. I’m Arya Stark.
17732,ARYA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Do you know who you are?
17733,ARYA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, You’re no one. You’re nothing.
17734,JAQEN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, A girl has taken a life. The wrong life.
17735,WAIF,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, I was right about her.
17736,JAQEN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, You were.
17737,WAIF,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, You’re not ready. Not at all.
17738,JAQEN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, That man’s life wasn’t yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed.
17739,JAQEN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Only death can pay for life.
17740,ARYA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1," No! No! No, you don’t die! Don’t die! (sobs)"
17741,WAIF,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Why are you crying?
17742,ARYA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, He was my friend.
17743,WAIF,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, No he wasn’t. Didn’t you listen to him?
17744,JAQEN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, He was no one.
17745,ARYA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, But if you’re… (looks to the Jaqen who drank the potion and is seemingly dead) Who’s this?
17746,JAQEN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.
17747,JAQEN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, The faces are for no one.
17748,JAQEN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, You are still someone.
17749,JAQEN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, And to someone…
17750,JAQEN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, ...the faces are as good as poison.
17751,ARYA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, I can’t see!
17752,ARYA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, What’s happening?! What’s happening?!
17753,DORAN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, I wish you a safe journey home.
17754,JAIME,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Thank you.
17755,ELLARIA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Forgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world.
17756,BRONN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Maybe I’ll come visit you sometime.
17757,TYENE,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Maybe I’ll come visit you.
17758,BRONN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Don’t wait too long. I’ve a noble woman to marry back home.
17759,TYENE,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1," You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy. (bites his ear)"
17760,JAIME,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1," Whenever you’re ready, My Lord."
17761,JAIME,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Try not to lose it this time.
17762,MYRCELLA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, I’ll never take it off again.
17763,JAIME,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, I know you didn’t want to leave Dorne. But I’m glad you’re coming home. Your mother’s desperate to see you. And I’m glad Trystane’s coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You’re lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.
17764,MYRCELLA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Do you think mother will like him.
17765,JAIME,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1," If she sees you’re happy, I’m sure she will."
17766,MYRCELLA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, And you really believe that?
17767,JAIME,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?
17768,MYRCELLA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, She likes you.
17769,JAIME,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1," I’m not so sure about that. Listen. There’s something I’ve wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you’ve seen more of the world, you’ve learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you’ve fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? (Myrcella laughs) My point is… we don’t choose whom we love. We just… It’s beyond our control. I sound like an idiot."
17770,MYRCELLA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, No you don’t.
17771,JAIME,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, What I’m trying to say. What I’m trying and failing to say…
17772,MYRCELLA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, I know what you’re trying to say.
17773,JAIME,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, No. I’m afraid you don’t.
17774,MYRCELLA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, I do.
17775,MYRCELLA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, I know. About you and mother. I think a part of me always knew. And I’m glad. I’m glad that you’re my father.
17776,JAIME,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Myrcella?
17777,JAIME,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Myrcella?!
17778,JAIME,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1, Myrcella?! Myrcella?!
17779,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," You love her, don’t you? How could you not. Of course, it’s hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman."
17780,DAARIO,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Does he always talk so much?
17781,GREY WORM,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Jorah the Andal.
17782,JORAH,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Torgo Nudho.
17783,GREY WORM,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, You should not be here.
17784,DAARIO,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," No, but he is."
17785,GREY WORM,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Our queen ordered him exiled from city.
17786,DAARIO,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Our queen would be dead if not for him.
17787,MISSANDEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, It’s true. And I would be dead if not for the… (look at Tyrion) little man.
17788,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Dwarf. I believe that’s the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.
17789,MISSANDEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, (Valyrian) A bit “rusty”.
17790,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, (Valyrian) “Rusty” (Common Tongue) Thank you.
17791,GREY WORM,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.
17792,DAARIO,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, You missed a good scrap.
17793,JORAH,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
17794,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," He’s right. The dragon headed north. If we’re going to find her, that’s where we’re to go."
17795,JORAH,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, We? You’re a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.
17796,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, And I intend to help her do it.
17797,JORAH,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, You’ve been here for how many days now? I’ve fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
17798,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, You betrayed her!
17799,JORAH,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Careful now.
17800,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," And she exiled you, twice, I believe?"
17801,JORAH,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, The second time thanks to you.
17802,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," Don’t blame me for your crimes, Mormont."
17803,DAARIO,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," (gestures to Tyrion) He’s right. The Queen exiled Jorah. (gestures to Jorah) And he’s right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we’ll know is if we ask her."
17804,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep."
17805,JORAH,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.
17806,DAARIO,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," Forgive me, but why would we bring you?"
17807,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Pardon me?
17808,DAARIO,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?
17809,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," Not precisely, but I have other skills that’d be very useful--"
17810,DAARIO,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Can you fight?
17811,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, I have fought. I don’t claim to be a great warrior.
17812,DAARIO,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Are you good on a horse?
17813,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Middling.
17814,DAARIO,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, So mainly you talk?
17815,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, And drink. I’ve survived so far.
17816,DAARIO,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. (to Missandei, Grey Worm, and Jorah) None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen."
17817,JORAH,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, He’s a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
17818,DAARIO,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, They wouldn’t. They will listen to Grey Worm.
17819,GREY WORM,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, I’ll come with you. I’ll find our queen.
17820,MISSANDEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
17821,GREY WORM,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, I am.
17822,DAARIO,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," He is, he’s the toughest man with no balls I’ve ever met. But you still can’t go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen."
17823,MISSANDEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," It’s true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half."
17824,DAARIO,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen’s closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. (to Tyrion) Try not to ruin her. (to Jorah) Looks like it’s you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let’s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about."
17825,VOICE,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," Hello, old friend."
17826,VARYS,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
17827,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, I suppose there’s no point in asking how you found me.
17828,VARYS,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you’ve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons."
17829,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," Well, she didn’t execute me, so that’s a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I’m stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?"
17830,VARYS,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies’ strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
17831,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
17832,VARYS,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," If only. (beat) A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?"
17833,TYRION,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, I did miss you.
17834,VARYS,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," Oh, I know."
17835,DAENERYS,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, We have to go home.
17836,DAENERYS,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? (pause) We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?"
17837,DAENERYS,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, How far did you carry me? (surveys the area)
17838,DAENERYS,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," Drogon, we need to return. My people need me."
17839,DAENERYS,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," Well, there’s no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper."
17840,SEPTA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Confess. Confess.
17841,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--"
17842,HIGH SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, You wish to make a confession?
17843,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," Once I’ve confessed, will I be free?"
17844,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.
17845,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess."
17846,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Name him.
17847,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Lancel Lannister.
17848,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Your cousin. And the King’s squire.
17849,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, I was lonely and afraid.
17850,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, You had a husband.
17851,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, A husband of whoring every chance he got.
17852,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, His sins do not pardon your own.
17853,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, May the gods forgive me.
17854,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Other men?
17855,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, No.
17856,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, No others?
17857,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, No.
17858,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime. You understand this?
17859,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, I do.
17860,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.
17861,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother’s children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers’. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it."
17862,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence."
17863,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Trial? I have confessed?
17864,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.
17865,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother’s mercy. I haven’t seen my son… I don’t know how long it’s been. I need to see him. Please.
17866,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep."
17867,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Thank you. Thank you.
17868,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, The Mother is merciful. It is her you should thank.
17869,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," I will, I will. I swear it, day and night."
17870,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Good.
17871,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Am I free to go?
17872,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, After your atonement.
17873,CERSEI,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, My atonement?
17874,SPARROW,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," A sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you. The good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart. Shorn of secrets. Naked before the eyes of gods and men. To make her walk of atonement."
17875,SEPTA,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Shame. Shame. Shame. (rings bell)
17876,CROWD,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Bitch! Whore! All hail her royal tits!
17877,WOMAN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, I’ve had half as many cocks as the queen!
17878,MAN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," Suck me off! Suck me off, you bitch!"
17879,QYBURN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Your Grace. It’s good to have you back. Come. We’ll take you inside. I need to have a look at those feet.
17880,QYBURN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard.
17881,QYBURN,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," If it please Your Grace, he’s taken a holy vow of silence. He has sworn that he will not speak until all his Grace’s enemies are dead, and the evil has been driven from the realm."
17882,DAVOS,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!
17883,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, We don’t have enough men to make any difference.
17884,DAVOS,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, The wildlings will make a difference!
17885,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," The wildlings won’t ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--"
17886,DAVOS,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1," You saved their bloody lives. If they’re going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place."
17887,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, It’s not their fight!
17888,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Stannis?
17889,DAVOS,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Shireen? The princess?
17890,OLLY,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Lord Commander. It’s one of the wildlings you brought back. Says he knows your Uncle Benjen. Says he’s still alive.
17891,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Are you sure he’s talking about Benjen?
17892,OLLY,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Says he was first Ranger. Said he knows where to find him.
17893,ALLISER,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome the last full moon.
17894,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, He could be lying.
17895,ALLISER,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Could be. There are ways to find out.
17896,JON,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Where is he?
17897,ALLISER,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1, Over there.

17905,NIGHT’S WATCHMAN,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - DAVOS’ CHAMBER_1, It’s the Lord Commander!
17906,DAVOS,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - DAVOS’ CHAMBER_1, Help me get him inside.
17907,DOLOROUS EDD,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_1, Thorne did this.
17908,DAVOS,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_1, How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?
17909,DOLOROUS EDD,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_1, Trust? The men in this room.
17910,DAVOS,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_1, Does the wolf know you?
17911,DAVOS,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_1, We need all the help we can get.
17912,MELISANDRE,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_1, Ser Davos.
17913,MELISANDRE,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_1," I saw him in the flames, fighting at Winterfell."
17914,DAVOS,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_1," I can’t speak for the flames, but he’s gone."
17915,MALE VOICE #1,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - MESS HALL_1, He was our Lord Commander!
17916,MALE VOICE #2,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - MESS HALL_1, He never should have been!
17917,ALLISER THORNE,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - MESS HALL_1, You all know why you’re here. Jon Snow is dead.
17918,NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #1,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - MESS HALL_1, Who killed him?
17919,ALLISER THORNE,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - MESS HALL_1, I did.
17920,ALLISER THORNE,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - MESS HALL_1, And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck and the other officers in this castle.
17921,NIGHT’S WATCHMEN #1,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - MESS HALL_1, Murderers!
17922,NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #2,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - MESS HALL_1, Traitors!
17923,ALLISER THORNE,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - MESS HALL_1, You’re right!
17924,ALLISER THORNE,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - MESS HALL_1," We’ve committed treason, all of us. Jon Snow was my Lord Commander. I had no love for him. That was no secret. But I never once disobeyed an order. Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night’s Watch is built, and the Watch means everything to me. I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Night’s Watch. Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night’s Watch. He let the wildlings through our gates, as no Lord Commander has ever done before. He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered. Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right, I’ve no doubt about that. And what he thought was right would have been the end of us. He thrust a terrible choice upon us, and we made it."
17925,DAVOS,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_3, He’ll have seen we didn’t come. Thorne will have made it official by now. Castle Black is his.
17926,DOLOROUS EDD,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_3," I don’t care who’s sitting at the high table. Jon was my friend, and those fuckers butchered him. Now we return the favor."
17927,DAVOS,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_3, We don’t have the numbers.
17928,DOLOROUS EDD,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_3, We have a direwolf.
17929,DAVOS,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_3," It’s not enough. I didn’t know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn’t have wanted his friends to die for nothing."
17930,DOLOROUS EDD,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_3," If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room. We all die today. I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go."
17931,DAVOS,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_3," We need to fight, but we don’t need to die. Not if we have help."
17932,NIGHT’S WATCHMAN,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_3, Who’s gonna help us?
17933,DAVOS,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_3, You’re not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.
17934,DOLOROUS EDD,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_3, Bolt the door. Don’t let anyone in. I’ll be back as soon as I can.
17935,RAMSAY,6,51,the red woman,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_3, She was 11 the first time I saw her.
17936,RAMSAY,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - ROOM_1," The kennelmaster’s daughter. She smelled of dog. I wasn’t much older, but everybody was already afraid of me. You certainly were."
17937,RAMSAY,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - ROOM_1," Myranda wasn’t, though. What could I do to her that those hounds couldn’t? She was fearless. There was nothing she wouldn’t do."
17938,RAMSAY,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - ROOM_1, Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over. I wish you could be here to watch.
17939,MAESTER WOLKAN,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - ROOM_1," Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord? Or would you rather the men build a pyre?"
17940,RAMSAY,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - ROOM_1," Buried, burned?"
17941,RAMSAY,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - ROOM_1, This is good meat. Feed it to the hounds.
17942,ROOSE,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1," Your command of the cavalry was impressive. Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead. Do you know who struck the killing blow?"
17943,RAMSAY,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1, No.
17944,ROOSE,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1," A shame.  I’d reward the man.  Still, a great victory. Do you feel like a victor?"
17945,ROOSE,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1," I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark. Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?"
17946,RAMSAY,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1, No.
17947,ROOSE,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1, A reckoning will come. We need the North to face it. The entire North. They won’t back us without Sansa Stark. We no longer have Sansa Stark. You played your games with her. You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they’re both gone.
17948,RAMSAY,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1, I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds. They won’t get far.
17949,ROOSE,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1," I’m glad to hear it. Without Sansa, you won’t be able to produce an heir. And without an heir, well…"
17950,ROOSE,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1, ...let’s hope the maesters are right and Lady Walder’s carrying a boy.EXT. NORTHERN WILDERNESSSANSA and THEON are running through the woods frantically. The barking of dogs can be heard in the distance. SANSA tires. THEON runs back to hear and pulls her onward.
17951,THEON,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1, We can’t stop.
17952,THEON,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1, We have to cross here.
17953,SANSA,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1, I can’t.
17954,THEON,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1, It’s the only way to throw off the hounds.
17955,SANSA,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1, But it’s too cold. I can’t. I won’t make it. I’ll die.
17956,THEON,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1, I’ve seen what his hounds do to a person. This way is better.
17957,THEON,6,51,the red woman,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS_1, Over here. Come on.
17958,THEON,6,51,the red woman,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS_1, Sansa. Sansa.
17959,THEON,6,51,the red woman,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS_1, Stay here. I’ll lure them away.
17960,SANSA,6,51,the red woman,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS_1," No, I won’t make it without you."
17961,THEON,6,51,the red woman,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS_1," You will. Go north, only north. Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black. He’ll help you."
17962,BOLTON OFFICER,6,51,the red woman,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS_1, Where is Lady Bolton?
17963,THEON,6,51,the red woman,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS_1, Dead.
17964,BOLTON OFFICER,6,51,the red woman,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS_1, Liar.
17965,THEON,6,51,the red woman,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS_1, She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts. I left her to die in the snow.
17966,BOLTON OFFICER,6,51,the red woman,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS_1, I can’t wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time.
17967,BOLTON OFFICER,6,51,the red woman,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS_1, It’s a bloody woman.
17968,BRIENNE,6,51,the red woman,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS_1," Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again. I will shield your back and keep your council and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new."
17969,SANSA,6,51,the red woman,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS_1, And I vow...that you shall always have a place by my hearth and…

17971,SANSA,6,51,the red woman,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS_1, Meat and mead at my table. And I pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the old gods and the new. Arise.
17972,HANDMAIDEN,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_1," Your Grace, I’m sorry to disturb you. A ship from Dorne has sailed into the harbor."
17973,CERSEI,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_1, Myrcella…
17974,CERSEI,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?
17975,JAIME,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, Mother.
17976,CERSEI,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3," All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now. Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?"
17977,CERSEI,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3,  I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.
17978,CERSEI,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.
17979,JAIME,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3," Shh, shh. Don’t think about it."
17980,CERSEI,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, I have to. I have to. It’s not right she has to suffer alone.
17981,JAIME,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, She’s not suffering. She’s gone. No one can hurt her anymore.
17982,CERSEI,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3," She was good. From her first breath, she was so sweet. I don’t know where she came from. She was nothing like me. No meanness, no jealous, just good."
17983,JAIME,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, I know.
17984,CERSEI,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3," I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...maybe I’m not a monster."
17985,JAIME,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, Listen -- listen to me. She was my daughter and I failed her.
17986,CERSEI,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3," No, I knew this would happen. The witch told me years ago. She promised me three children. She promised me they’d die. “And gold their shrouds.” Everything she said came true. You couldn’t have stopped it. It’s prophecy. It’s fate."
17987,JAIME,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, You don’t believe that.
17988,CERSEI,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3," Of course I do. You told me yourself when Father died. You said we had to stay together. You said people would try to tear us apart, take what’s ours. That was a prophecy, too. I didn’t listen to you, and everything you said came true."
17989,JAIME,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3," Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate. Fuck everyone who isn’t us. We’re the only ones who matter, the only ones in this world. And everything they’ve taken from us, we’re going to take back and more."

17992,MARGAERY,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, I’d like to see my brother.
17993,SEPTA UNELLA,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, Confess.
17994,MARGAERY,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, Please. How is he? At least tell me that.
17995,SEPTA UNELLA,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, Confess.
17996,MARGAERY,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, I am the queen and I demand to see my brother.
17997,SEPTA UNELLA,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, Sinners don’t make commands. They make confessions.
17998,HIGH SPARROW,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, Septa Unella.
17999,HIGH SPARROW,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, Our other guests need you.
18000,HIGH SPARROW,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, There.
18001,HIGH SPARROW,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, Septa Unella can be overzealous at times. I’ll speak with her.
18002,MARGAERY,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3," My brother, can you tell me how he is?"
18003,HIGH SPARROW,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, It isn’t Ser Loras that brings me here. Your husband misses you dearly. The love between a man and wife is sacred. It reflects the love the gods have for all of us. But sin leads us away from the sacred. And only confession can purge sin.
18004,MARGAERY,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, I have nothing to confess.
18005,HIGH SPARROW,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, So you believe you are pure? Perfect? Wholly without sin?
18006,MARGAERY,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, None of us are.
18007,HIGH SPARROW,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, You have started down the path. But you have many miles to go..
18008,DORAN,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, I always envied Oberyn. He lived. He truly lived. Sailed around the world. Fought men from every country. Lay with the most beautiful women alive.
18009,ELLARIA,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, And men.
18010,DORAN,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3," And men. He experienced everything, while I sat here in Dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed. But that is life. We each have our roles."
18011,DORAN,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, Oberyn was born to be an adventurer. And I was born to rule.
18012,ELLARIA,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3," The gods are not fools. You would have been a lousy adventurer. And Oberyn, pfft, he would have been a terrible ruler."
18013,DORAN,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3," Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?"
18014,MAESTER,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, Prince Doran.
18015,DORAN,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, The Princess Myrcella…
18016,ELLARIA,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3," When was the last time you left this palace? You don’t know your own people. Their disgust for you. Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing. Oberyn martell butchered, and you did nothing. You’re not a Dornishman. You’re not our prince."
18017,DORAN,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, My son Trystane…
18018,ELLARIA,6,51,the red woman,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_3, Your son is weak just like you. And weak men will never rule Dorne again.
18019,TRYSTANE,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, I told you I’m not hungry.
18020,OBARA,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, We’re not here to feed you.

18022,NYMERIA,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, You want her to do it or me?
18023,TRYSTANE,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, We are family. I don’t want to hurt you.
18024,NYMERIA,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Her or me?
18025,NYMERIA,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Good.
18026,OBARA,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Smart boy.
18027,NYMERIA,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," You’re a greedy bitch, you know that?"
18028,TYRION,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, We’re never going to fix what’s wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.
18029,TYRION,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, We’ll be fine. We’re dressed like common merchants.
18030,VARYS,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, You walk like a rich person.
18031,TYRION,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, You’ve spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?
18032,VARYS,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property. I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.
18033,TYRION,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, It’s a good thing you’re not a boy anymore...because you have no cock.
18034,TYRION,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, For your baby. To eat.
18035,VARYS,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, She thinks you want to eat her baby.
18036,VARYS,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," His Valyrian is terrible. He only wants to give you money, so your baby can eat."
18037,VARYS,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
18038,TYRION,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, I know what mhysa means.
18039,VARYS,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Who wrote it?
18040,TYRION,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Hard to know. Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.
18041,VARYS,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, The Sons of the Harpy?
18042,TYRION,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," Very possibly. Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren’t even property to begin with. You can see why they’re unhappy. Of course, it could also be the freed men."
18043,LISTENERS,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, For the night is dark and full of terrors.
18044,RED PRIEST,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," The Lord of Light sent the Mother of Dragons to you, and those who love the darkness chased her away."
18045,TYRION,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.
18046,VARYS,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.
18047,RED PRIEST,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," How will you respond? Will you wring your hands, while you wait for the Mother of Dragons to return? Or will you  you take up her flames yourselves? Will you fight for your own salvation, now that Queen Daenerys is not here to fight for you?"
18048,TYRION,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, It’s a problem.
18049,TYRION,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill. Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you. We can’t fight an enemy we don’t know."
18050,VARYS,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone."
18051,TYRION,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, And have you started looking for that someone?
18052,VARYS,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," My little birds have already taken wing. Soon they’ll return, singing songs of men in gold masks."

18055,JORAH,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Ram.
18056,DAARIO,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, You think our friend got him?
18057,JORAH,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Don’t know anything else that can melt a ram’s horn.
18058,DAARIO,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," We’re on the right path, then."
18059,DAARIO,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Perhaps she’s tired of being queen. I don’t think she likes it very much.
18060,JORAH,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, She’s too smart to like it.
18061,DAARIO,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," Maybe she’s flown somewhere else, somewhere far away from men like us."
18062,JORAH,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, I’ve been all over the world. There’s no escaping men like us.
18063,DAARIO,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," There’s no escaping her, eh? You keep coming back. Why?"
18064,JORAH,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, You know why.
18065,DAARIO,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, isn’t it frustrating wanting someone who doesn’t want you back?
18066,JORAH,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Of course it is.
18067,DAARIO,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," You’re a romantic. I admire that. Sometimes I look at you and I think, “So that’s what I’ll be like when I grow old.”"
18068,JORAH,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, If you grow old.
18069,DAARIO,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, If I grow old. I hope I do. I want to see what the world looks like when she’s done conquering it.
18070,JORAH,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, So do I.
18071,DAARIO,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," Huh, an army?"
18072,JORAH,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Not an army. A horde.
18073,DAARIO,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Dothraki?

DAENERYS is walking beside the horse of two Dothraki bloodriders. DAENERYS trips. BLOODRIDER #1 whips her. Both men laugh. They speak in Dothraki.
18075,BLOODRIDER #1,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Maybe she saw a ghost. My friend’s mother saw a ghost and her hair turned white.
18076,BLOODRIDER #2,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Pink people are afraid of the sun. It burns their skin. This one stands too long in the sun and her hair goes white.
18077,BLOODRIDER #1,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, You think she’s got white pussy hair too? You ever been with a girl with white pussy hair?
18078,BLOODRIDER #2,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, Only when I was fucking your grandma.
18079,BLOODRIDER #1,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, I’ll ask Khal Moro for a night with you. What do you think?
18080,BLOODRIDER #2,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," Pretty eyes, but she’s an idiot."
18081,BLOODRIDER #1,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1, She doesn’t have to be smart to get fucked in the ass.
18082,BLOODRIDER #2,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1," I like to talk when I’m finished. Otherwise, we might as well be dogs."
18083,BLOODRIDER #2,6,51,the red woman,ESSOS ARID LANDS - DOTHRAKI SETTLEMENT_1," For you, my Khal. The white-haired girl we found in the hills."

18087,WIFE#1,6,51,the red woman,ESSOS ARID LANDS - DOTHRAKI SETTLEMENT_1," Cut off her head, before she casts a spell on you."
18088,KHAL MORO,6,51,the red woman,ESSOS ARID LANDS - DOTHRAKI SETTLEMENT_1," Even if I was blind, I’d hear my wives say, “Cut off her head” and I’d know this woman was beautiful. I’m glad I’m not blind. Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time, what is better than that?"
18089,BLOODRIDER #3,6,51,the red woman,ESSOS ARID LANDS - DOTHRAKI SETTLEMENT_1, Killing another Khal?

Gives me a little smile like, “Well?” So, all right, you know, I’ve never been shy and I’m blessed down south, so I put it right out. She’s never seen anything like it.

18190,KING’S SOLDIER,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_5," King’s orders, Your Grace."
18191,CERSEI,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_5, What are the king’s orders?
18192,KING’S SOLDIER,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_5," He would like you to remain in the Red Keep, Your Grace, for your own protection."
18193,CERSEI,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_5, You’re barring me from attending my own daughter’s funeral?
18194,KING’S SOLDIER,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_5," Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king’s command, I cannot let you pass."
18195,CERSEI,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_5, I would like to speak to my son.
18196,KING’S SOLDIER,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_5," He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace."
18197,TOMMEN,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, She grew up.
18198,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, Almost.
18199,TOMMEN,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, Have we caught Prince Trystane’s killers? I expect it was Mother.
18200,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, Your mother wouldn’t do that.
18201,TOMMEN,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1," Yes, she would."
18202,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, Are you angry with her?
18203,TOMMEN,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, Of course not.
18204,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, Then why didn’t you let her come? She has every right to be here.
18205,TOMMEN,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, They told me she wouldn’t be allowed in the sept. If she had tried --
18206,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1," They’re not putting your mother in a cell ever again. Not while I’m here. Why haven’t you gone to see her? Everything she endured, she did it for you."
18207,TOMMEN,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, Don’t you think I know that? I’m sorry. But I can’t.
18208,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, Why not?
18209,TOMMEN,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1," When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery, what did I do? When they paraded her through the streets like a whore, what did I do?"
18210,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, We all fail sometimes.
18211,TOMMEN,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1," The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm. If I can’t even protect my own wife or my own mother, what good am I?"
18212,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you.
18213,HIGH SPARROW,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, Your Grace. Lord Commander.
18214,TOMMEN,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, I want to see my wife.
18215,HIGH SPARROW,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, The gods wait for Queen Margaery to confess her crimes and seek their mercy. The king must wait as well.
18216,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1," Go and see your mother, Tommen."
18217,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, You’re a bold man.
18218,HIGH SPARROW,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1," On the contrary. I fear a great deal. The Father, the Mother, the Warrior."
18219,HIGH SPARROW,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, Do you know why we use these stones? To remind us not to fear death. We close our eyes on this world and open them on the next.
18220,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, You must long for the next life.
18221,HIGH SPARROW,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1," In truth, I fear that, too."
18222,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, You imprisoned and humiliated my sister.
18223,HIGH SPARROW,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, Your sister sought the gods’ mercy and atoned for her sin.
18224,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, What about my sins?
18225,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1," I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back. I killed my own cousin. When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape their justice. What atonement do I deserve?"
18226,HIGH SPARROW,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, You would spill blood in this holy place?
18227,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1," Oh, the gods won’t mind. They’ve spilled more blood than the rest of us combined."
18228,HIGH SPARROW,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1," Go on, then. I deserve it. We all do. We are weak, vain creatures. We live only by the Mother’s mercy."
18229,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, They should be closer if you mean for them to save you.
18230,HIGH SPARROW,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, I don’t. They’d never reach me before you struck.
18231,JAIME,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1, I’ve fought against worse odds.
18232,HIGH SPARROW,6,52,home,KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_1," No doubt many of us would fall. But who are we, hmm? We have no names, no family. Every one of us is poor and powerless. And yet together, we can overthrow an empire."
18233,TOMMEN,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7, Mother.
18234,CERSEI,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7, Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?
18235,TOMMEN,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7, Gold.
18236,CERSEI,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7, Good. It was always her color.
18237,TOMMEN,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7," I’m sorry for keeping you here. I shouldn’t have, but I was -- I didn’t want to lose you again."
18238,CERSEI,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7, I understand. I’m glad to see you.
18239,TOMMEN,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7, I know I should have come sooner. I wanted to. I was wrong.
18240,CERSEI,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7, It’s all right.
18241,TOMMEN,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7," No, it isn’t."
18242,TOMMEN,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7," I should have executed all of them. I should have pulled down the sept onto the High Sparrow’s head before I let them do that to you, as you would have for me. You raised me to be strong...and I wasn’t. But I want to be. Help me."
18243,CERSEI,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7, Always.
18244,TYRION,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1," If I lost my cock, I’d drink all the time."
18245,TYRION,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1," Meaning no offense. He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes."
18246,VARYS,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, I do not make dwarf jokes.
18247,TYRION,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, You think them.
18248,VARYS,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1," So, the fleet. It’s been burned."
18249,GREY WORM,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1," We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything."
18250,TYRION,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, Surely there’s some good news lurking somewhere.
18251,VARYS,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid.
18252,TYRION,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, Perhaps they can tell us their secret.
18253,VARYS,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1," The Masters have retaken both cities. Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver’s Bay has returned to the slavers."
18254,TYRION,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.
18255,MISSANDEI,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, They are not eating. They haven’t touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.
18256,TYRION,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1," Daenerys is the dragon queen. Can’t very well let the dragons starve, that’s obvious."
18257,GREY WORM,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1," If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?"
18258,TYRION,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, Dragons do not do well in captivity.
18259,MISSANDEI,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, How do you know this?
18260,TYRION,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, That’s what I do. I drink and I know things.
18261,TYRION,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1," The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles. Then Daenerys’s ancestors started chaining them up in pens. A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats. They must be unchained or they’ll waste away. Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?"
18262,MISSANDEI,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, Many times.
18263,TYRION,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, And did they ever harm you?
18264,MISSANDEI,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, Never.
18265,TYRION,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, Dragons are intelligent. More intelligent than men according to some maesters. They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies. I am their friend.
18266,VARYS,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, Do they know that?
18267,TYRION,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1, They will. It’s time they had their supper.
18268,TYRION,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, I’m friends with your mother. I’m here to help. Don’t eat the help.
18269,TYRION,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day. I begged him for one of you. “It wouldn’t even have to be a big dragon,” I told him. “It could be little, like me.”"
18270,TYRION,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard. Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago. I cried myself to sleep that night.
18271,TYRION,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, But here you are.
18272,TYRION,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face."
18273,WAIF,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, What’s your name?
18274,WAIF,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, What’s your name?
18275,ARYA,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, No one.
18276,WAIF,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, I don’t believe that.
18277,WAIF,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, You don’t believe that.
18278,JAQEN,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, Who are you?
18279,ARYA,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, No one.
18280,JAQEN,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," If a girl says her name, a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight."
18281,ARYA,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, A girl has no name.
18282,JAQEN,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," If a girl says her name, a man will feed her tonight."
18283,ARYA,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, A girl has no name.
18284,JAQEN,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," If a girl says her name, a man will give her eyes back."
18285,ARYA,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, A girl has no name.
18286,JAQEN,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, Come.
18287,JAQEN,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, Leave it. A girl is not a beggar anymore.
18288,LORD KARSTARK,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, He came upon the bodies on our way here.
18289,ROOSE,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?
18290,RAMSAY,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, They obviously had help.
18291,ROOSE,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," I didn’t think lady Sansa killed them all by herself. Thank you for this report, Lord Kastark."
18292,RAMSAY,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, We know where she’s going. Her brother’s at Castle Black.
18293,LORD KARSTARK,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, Ned Stark’s last surviving son?
18294,ROOSE,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark."
18295,RAMSAY,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," So was I, Father."
18296,LORD KARSTARK,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, Your hold on the North will never be secure as long as a Stark can walk through that door.
18297,RAMSAY,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," Castle Black isn’t defended on the southern side. And the few men left are barely men at all. Farm boys and thieves. With a small force we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow --"
18298,ROOSE,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, Murder the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch? You’d unite every house in the North against us.
18299,RAMSAY,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," We don’t need every house in the North. The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks. command more soldiers than all the other houses combined. With their support, none could challenge us."
18300,LORD KARSTARK,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, The Starks lost my house the day King Rob cut off my father’s head. It’s time for new blood in the North.
18301,ROOSE,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog, you’ll be treated as a mad dog. Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed."
18302,MAESTER WOLKAN,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, My lords. Lady Walda has given birth. A boy. Red-cheeked and healthy.
18303,LORD KARSTARK,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," My congratulations, Lord Bolton."
18304,RAMSEY,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," Congratulations, Father. I look forward to meeting my new brother."
18305,ROOSE,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, You’ll always be my firstborn.
18306,RAMSAY,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, Thank you for saying that. It means a great deal to me.
18307,RAMSAY,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," Maester Wolkan, send ravens to all the Northern houses. Roose Bolton is dead. Poisoned by our enemies."
18308,RAMSAY,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, How did he die?
18309,MAESTER WOLKAN,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, Poisoned by his enemies.
18310,LORD KARSTARK,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, You're talking to your lord. Use respect.
18311,MAESTER WOLKAN,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," Forgive me, my lord."
18312,RAMSAY,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1, Send for Lady Walda and the baby.
18313,MAESTER WOLKAN,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," She’s resting, my lord."
18314,MAESTER WOLKAN,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1," At once, my lord."
18315,RAMSAY,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, There he is.
18316,LADY WALDA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, Isn’t he wonderful?
18317,RAMSEY,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, May I hold him?
18318,LADY WALDA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, Of course.
18319,RAMSAY,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, Little brother.
18320,LADY WALDA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, Lord Bolton sent for us. Have you seen him?
18321,RAMSAY,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1," Of course. Follow me, Mother."
18322,LADY WALDA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, Where is Lord Bolton?
18323,RAMSAY,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, Down!
18324,LADY WALDA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1," It’s all right. Come on, shh."
18325,LADY WALDA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1," It’s cold out here, Ramsay. I need to feed him."
18326,LADY WALDA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1," Ramsay, where is your father? Ramsay? Where is Lord Bolton?"
18327,RAMSAY,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, I am Lord Bolton.
18328,LADY WALDA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1," Ramsay. Ramsay, please. I’ll leave Winterfell. I’ll go back to the Riverlands. Please. Ramsay. He’s your brother."
18329,RAMSEY,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, I prefer being an only child.
18330,BRIENNE,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1," I saw her with a man. I don’t think he hurt her. She didn’t want to leave him, he didn’t want to leave her."
18331,SANSA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, You don’t know which way she went?
18332,BRIENNE,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, I spent three days looking for her. She disappeared.
18333,SANSA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, How did she look?
18334,BRIENNE,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, She looked good. She wasn’t exactly dressed like a lady.
18335,SANSA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1," No, she wouldn’t be."
18336,BRIENNE,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, What happened at Winterfell?
18337,SANSA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, I should’ve gone with you while I had the chance.
18338,BRIENNE,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1," It was a difficult choice, my lady."
18339,BRIENNE,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, We’ve all had to make difficult choices.
18340,THEON,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, We shouldn’t be lighting fires. It’s not safe. He won’t stop hunting us.
18341,SANSA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1," We just have to make it to Castle Black. Once we’re with Jon, Ramsay won’t be able to touch us."
18342,THEON,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate.
18343,SANSA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, I won’t let him. I’ll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.
18344,THEON,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1," And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place? The truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded?"
18345,THEON,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1," And the truth about Rob, who I betrayed?"
18346,SANSA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1," When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven."
18347,THEON,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, I don’t want to be forgiven. I can never make amends to your family for all the things that I’ve done. They’ll keep you safer than I ever could.
18348,SANSA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, You’re not coming with us?
18349,THEON,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, I would have taken you all the way to the Wall. I would have died to get you there.
18350,THEON,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, May I take one of the horses?
18351,SANSA,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, Where will you go?
18352,THEON,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1, Home.
18353,YARA,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1, The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.
18354,BALON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1, And the Ironborn who held it?
18355,YARA,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1, They died fighting to a man.
18356,BALON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1, What is dead may never die.
18357,YARA,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1, What is dead may never die.
18358,YARA,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1, But they did and our invasion died with them. Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.
18359,BALON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1, They we will take more.
18360,YARA,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1, Why? For more pinecones and rocks?
18361,BALON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1, Because I order it.
18362,YARA,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1," We can defeat anyone at sea, but we’ll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies."
18363,BALON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1," Not if our captains defy my orders, abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish mission."
18364,YARA,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1, I won’t apologize for trying to rescue Theon.
18365,BALON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1, Then where is he?
18366,YARA,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1," Where is your kingdom? We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war. That war is over. The last time we provoked them too far, I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers. I lost two brothers that day."
18367,BALON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1," And I lost three sons. The War of the Five Kings, they call it. Well, the other four are dead. When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you wan. But for now, shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will."
18368,BALON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1," Let me pass. You fool, move aside for your king."
18369,HOODED FIGURE,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1," Haven’t I always, brother?"
18370,BALON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1, I thought you’d be rotting under some foreign sea by now.
18371,EURON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1, What is dead may never die.
18372,EURON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1, Has the custom changed since I’ve been gone? Aren’t you supposed to repeat the words?
18373,BALON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1, You can mock our god without my help.
18374,EURON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1," I don’t mock the Drowned God. I am the Drowned God. From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray."
18375,EURON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1," You’re old, brother. You've had your time. Now let another rule."
18376,BALON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1, I heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea. They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.
18377,EURON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1, They did.
18378,BALON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1," And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues."
18379,EURON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1, I needed silence.
18380,BALON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1, What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm?
18381,EURON,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1," I am the storm, brother. The first storm and the last. And you’re in my way."
18382,AERON,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1," Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves. Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh. Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children."
18383,ALL,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, What is dead may never die.
18384,YARA,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, I’m going to find out who did this. I’m going to feed them to the sharks while they live. I swear it by the Salt Throne.
18385,AERON,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1," The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon, not unless the kingsmoot chooses you."
18386,YARA,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, My father would’ve wanted me to rule.
18387,AERON,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear. Perhaps you'll win. Perhaps you’ll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn. And perhaps not.INT. CASTLE BLACK - MELISANDRE’S CHAMBERMELISANDRE is sitting at the fireplace. Someone knocks on the door.
18388,MELISANDRE,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, Come in.
18389,DAVOS,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1," I'm sorry, my lady. I didn’t mean to interrupt."
18390,MELISANDRE,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, You interrupt nothing.
18391,DAVOS,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, I assume you know why I’m here.
18392,MELISANDRE,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, I will after you tell me.
18393,DAVOS,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, It’s about the Lord Commander.
18394,MELISANDRE,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, The former Lord Commander.
18395,DAVOS,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, Does he have to be?
18396,MELISANDRE,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, What are you asking?
18397,DAVOS,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, Do you know of any magic...that could help him? Bring him back?
18398,MELISANDRE,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1," If you want to help him, leave him be."
18399,DAVOS,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, Can it be done?
18400,MELISANDRE,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, There are some with his power.
18401,DAVOS,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, How?
18402,MELISANDRE,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, I don’t know.
18403,DAVOS,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, Have you seen it done?
18404,MELISANDRE,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1," I met a man who came back from the dead, but the priest who did it -- It shouldn’t have been possible."
18405,DAVOS,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, But it was. It could be now.
18406,MELISANDRE,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, Not for me.
18407,DAVOS,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, Not for you? I saw you drink poison that should’ve killed you. I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.
18408,MELISANDRE,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1," Everything I believed, the great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie."
18409,MELISANDRE,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, You were right all along. The Lord never spoke to me.
18410,DAVOS,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1," Fuck him, then. Fuck all of them. I’m not a devout man, obviously. Seven Gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same."
18411,DAVOS,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, I’m not asking the Lord of Light for help.I’m asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.
18412,MELISANDRE,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, I never had this gift.
18413,DAVOS,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1, Have you ever tried?
18414,MELISANDRE,6,52,home,CASTLE BLACK - ROOM_5, Please.
18415,DAVOS,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_100," Easy, easy. Easy."
18416,DAVOS,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_100, What do you remember?
18417,JON SNOW,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_100, They stabbed me. Olly...he put a knife in my heart. I shouldn’t be here.
18418,DAVOS,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_100, The lady brought you back.
18419,MELISANDRE,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_100," Afterwards, after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go? What did you see?"
18420,JON SNOW,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_100, Nothing. There was nothing at all.
18421,MELISANDRE,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_100," The Lord let you come back for a reason. Stannis was not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be."
18422,DAVOS,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_100, Could you give us a moment?
18423,DAVOS,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_100," You were dead. And now you’re not. That’s completely fucking mad, seems to me. I can only imagine how it seems to you."
18424,JON SNOW,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_100, I did what I thought was right. And I got murdered for it. And now I’m back. Why?
18425,DAVOS,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_100, I don’t know. Maybe we’ll never know. What does it matter? You go on. You fight for as long as you can. You clean up as much of the shit as you can.
18426,JON SNOW,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_100," I don’t know how to do that. I thought I did, but...I failed."
18427,DAVOS,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_100, Good. Now go fail again.
18428,TORMUND,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_1, They think you’re some kind of god. The man who returned from the dead.
18429,JON SNOW,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_1, I’m not a god.
18430,TORMUND,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_1, I know that.
18431,TORMUND,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_1, I saw your pecker. What kind of god would have a pecker that small?
18432,DOLOROUS EDD,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_1, Your eyes are still brown. Is that still you in there?
18433,JON SNOW,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_1, I think so. Hold off on burning my body for now.
18434,DOLOROUS EDD,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_1, That’s funny. You sure that’s still you in there?
18435,GILLY,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, You all right?
18436,SAMWELL,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1," Yes. Yes, I’m fine."
18437,GILLY,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?
18438,SAMWELL,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, I don’t think so.
18439,GILLY,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1," Sea, see. They’re spelled different, but they sound the same."
18440,SAMWELL,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1," Yeah, they do."
18441,GILLY,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1," It was before I learned how to read, obviously."
18442,GILLY,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1," Sam, are you going to be sick?"
18443,GILLY,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, Won’t be long. We’ll be in the south soon. I’m excited to see Oldtown. Captain says it’s the most beautiful city in Westeros. Are you going to vomit again?
18444,SAMWELL,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1," No. No, no, no. The Citadel doesn’t admit women. There won’t be a place for you there or for Little Sam."
18445,GILLY,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, I stayed at Castle Black. There’s no women allowed there.
18446,SAMWELL,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, The Citadel isn’t Castle Black. I don’t have a Jon Snow or a Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules.
18447,GILLY,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1," I’ll stay in Oldtown, then."
18448,SAMWELL,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, By yourself? With a baby and no money?
18449,GILLY,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1," So if we’re not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?"
18450,SAMWELL,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1," To my home. Horn Hill. My father’s -- well, my father, but my mother’s a kind woman and my sister’s lovely. They’ll take care of you both."
18451,GILLY,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1," “Wherever you go, I go, too.” That’s what you said."
18452,SAMWELL,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, I said that because I want you and Little Same to be safe. That’s all I want -- to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you’ll be safe
18453,GILLY,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, Us and everyone else in the world.
18454,SAMWELL,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1," I don’t care about them. Well, no, I do, but I don’t really. I care about you and him."
18455,GILLY,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1," I know that, Sam. And he does, too. You're the only one who ever has."
18456,GILLY,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1," If you think it’s for the best, we trust you."
18457,SAMWELL,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, I’d feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off.
18458,GILLY,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, I’d never do that to the father of my son.
18459,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, That’s my father.
18460,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1," The man beside him is Howland Reed, Meera’s father."
18461,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, Ser Arthur Dayne.
18462,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, The Sword of the Morning.
18463,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw.
18464,ARTHUR,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, Lord Stark.
18465,NED,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, I looked for you on the Trident.
18466,ARTHUR,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, We weren’t there.
18467,KINGSGUARD,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, Your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been.
18468,NED,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, The Mad King is dead. Rhaegar lies beneath the ground. Why weren’t you there to protect your prince?
18469,ARTHUR,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, Our prince wanted us here.
18470,NED,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, Where’s my sister?
18471,ARTHUR,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
18472,ARTHUR,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, And now it begins.
18473,NED,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, No. Now it ends.
18474,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, He’s better than my father.
18475,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, Far better.
18476,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, But Father beat him.
18477,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, Did he?
18478,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, I know he did. Heard the story a thousand times.
18479,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, He stabbed him in the back.
18480,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, What’s in the tower?
18481,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, That’s enough for one day. We’ll visit again another time.
18482,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, I want to see where he’s going.
18483,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, Time to go.
18484,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1, Father!
18485,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, Why did you do that? Take me back there. I want to go back.
18486,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, No.
18487,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, He heard me.
18488,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, Maybe. Maybe he heard the wind.
18489,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, He heard me.
18490,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, The past is already written. The ink is dry.
18491,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, What’s in that tower? I want to go back there.
18492,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," I’ve told you many times, stay too long where you don’t belong and you will never return."
18493,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, Why do I want to return? So I can be a cripple again? So I can talk to an old man in a tree?
18494,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me?"
18495,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, So why did you?
18496,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, I was waiting for you.
18497,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, I don’t want to be you.
18498,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," I don’t blame you. You won’t be here forever. You won’t be an old man in a tree. But before you leave, you must learn."
18499,BRAN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, Learn what?
18500,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, Everything.EXT. VAES DOTHRAK - DAYDAENERYS is entering Vaes Dothrak with the horde. A mounted Bloodrider ushers her onward with a nudge of his foot.
18501,BLOODRIDER,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"  Hey, Great Khaleesi. Move your ass."
18502,KHAL MORO,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," Welcome home, Khaleesi."
18503,DOTHRAKI WOMAN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, Go.
18504,DAENERYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads!
18505,DAENERYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, You have made a mistake. One you will regret. I am the wife of the Great Khal.
18506,DOTHRAKI MATRON,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, We know who you are. I remember you eating the stallion’s heart. Why didn’t you come to us after Khal Drogo died?
18507,DAENERYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons. My place is not here with you."
18508,DOTHRAKI MATRON,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," You were the wife of the Great Khal. You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side. He didn’t. I was the wife of the Great Khal. Khal Savo. I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side. You’re young. We were all young once. But we all understand the way things are. You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us."
18509,DAENERYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.
18510,DOTHRAKI MATRON,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," Yes. Immediately after the death of their khal. But you went out into the world. That is forbidden. All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven. They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved. And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo’s silver-haired widow. With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons. It is the best you can hope for, now.INT. MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOMVARYS is sitting on the steps of the throne, fanning himself. Several Unsullied stand around the perimeters of the room."
18511,VARYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, I don’t know how you stand it in all that leather.
18512,VARYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, If we could have the room.
18513,VARYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," You look lovely today, my dear. You really do. How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat."
18514,WOMAN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," If you’re going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it."
18515,VARYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, I am not a torturer.
18516,VARYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, Though it so often is what people deserve.
18517,VARYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," And it does provide answers. But they’re usually the wrong answers. My job is to find the right answers. Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy. I’d like to make you happy, Vala. That’s your name, isn’t it, Vala?"
18518,VARYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," That’s all right. I know who you are and what you’ve done. You’ve done a lot. You’ve sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do. And you’ve helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons."
18519,VALA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history.
18520,VARYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," I understand. Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective. I have a different perspective, of course. I think it’s important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours. Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy. That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I’m afraid I don’t really speak the language. Such a handsome boy. Those big, brown eyes. Good luck keeping the ladies away."
18521,VALA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," Yes, you’re a true liberator, aren’t you? You won’t torture me, you’ll just threaten my son."
18522,VARYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," Children are blameless. I have never hurt them. Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you. But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen’s soldiers. We both know the penalty for that crime. How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem."
18523,VALA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," If I tell you anything, they’ll kill me. So either you kill me or they do."
18524,VARYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3," Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem. There is a third option, though. A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos. I’ve already booked passage for a woman and her young son. I’ll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again."
18525,VARYS,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3, Though I’m afraid we’ll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it. Far too heavy for me. The boat sails at dawn. You need to decide now. A new life for you and Dom or…
18526,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?"
18527,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, You speak 19 languages. You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.
18528,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," You two, you spend a great deal of time together. What would you be talking about if I weren’t here?"
18529,GREY WORM,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Patrol. When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied. What we see on patrol. Who we captured on patrol.
18530,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, That’s good. That’s very good.
18531,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, But that’s a report. I was thinking more of a conversation. A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms.
18532,MISSANDEI,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Who said this?
18533,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Me. Just now. All right, no conversations. Let’s play a game."
18534,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," You don’t play games, either one of you, ever?"
18535,GREY WORM,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Games are for children.
18536,MISSANDEI,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.
18537,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," There, that’s a start."
18538,MISSANDEI,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Only the girls.
18539,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Oh no, no, no. Not that, of course not that. Innocent games, fun games, drinking games."
18540,MISSANDEI,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, We do not drink.
18541,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Until you do.
18542,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Alright. No drinking. We can play without drinking. It’s a wonderful game. I invented it. Here’s how it works. I make a statement about your past. If I’m wrong, I drink. And if I’m right -- Maybe we can’t play without drinking."
18543,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Oh, you took your time."
18544,VARYS,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Sorry. I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy. Some things you can’t rush.
18545,MISSANDEI,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, You found out?
18546,VARYS,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, The good masters of Astapor. And the wise masters of Yunkai. With help from their friends in Volantis.
18547,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, You see? You don’t even have to worry about the local rebellion. We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it.
18548,GREY WORM,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once. We will do it again and execute the Masters.
18549,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?"
18550,GREY WORM,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?"
18551,MISSANDEI,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," We cannot. The Masters only speak one language. They spoke it to me for many years. I know it better than my mother tongue. If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them. May it be the last thing they ever hear."
18552,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, You may be right.
18553,GREY WORM,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, So we will fight them?
18554,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Possibly.
18555,MISSANDEI,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Possibly?
18556,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, It’s a conversation.
18557,TYRION,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis?"
18558,VARYS,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Of course. Man can be fickle, but birds always trust."
18559,QYBURN,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Your eye looks much better, Arthur. How’s your mother’s jaw?"
18560,ARTHUR,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Better.
18561,QYBURN,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, And your father?
18562,ARTHUR,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, No one’s seen him.
18563,QYBURN,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, And no one will. That worked out rather nicely.
18564,LITTLE BIRD,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Will Lord Varys ever come back?
18565,QYBURN,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, I don’t think so. Do you miss him?
18566,LITTLE BIRD,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, He was nice.
18567,ARTHUR,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, He called us his little birds. He gave us sweets.
18568,QYBURN,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, It’s funny you should mention that. Guess what I happened to find today. Candied plums from Dorne.
18569,QYBURN,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me. All I need in return are whispers."
18570,QYBURN,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, No need to be afraid. This is Ser Gregor. He’s friends with all my friends.
18571,QYBURN,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Run along now.
18572,CERSEI,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Varys's little birds?
18573,QYBURN,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Your little birds now, your Grace."
18574,JAIME,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, What did you do to him exactly? I haven't been able to get a clear answer.
18575,QYBURN,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Oh, a number of things."
18576,JAIME,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Does he understand what we’re saying? I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place."
18577,QYBURNS,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, He understands well enough.
18578,JAIME,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow’s head like a melon.
18579,CERSEI,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him. Ser Gregor will can’t face them all. And he won’t have to. He’ll only have to face one.
18580,JAIME,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?
18581,CERSEI,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Not yet.
18582,JAIME,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.
18583,CERSEI,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Don’t stop at the city. I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North. If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it. If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear. I want to know who they are. I want to where they are."
18584,MAESTER PYCELLE,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was, Qyburn is worse. I told them all. I told them. He’s arrogant, dangerous. You don’t get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason. And no one listened to my advice, so here we are."
18585,MAESTER PYCELLE,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination. We never sanctioned this, this experiment. And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest --"
18586,KEVAN,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Can I help you?
18587,CERSEI,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Why are you here?
18588,MACE TYRELL,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, My mother...
18589,LADY OLENNA,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," I was invited, my dear, o help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen’s imprisonment."
18590,CERSEI,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Thank you for bringing it up. It’s well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.
18591,LADY OLENNA,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Margaery is the queen. You are not the queen because you’re not married to the king. I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family.
18592,KEVAN,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, This is a Small Council meeting. You have no position on the Small Council.
18593,JAIME,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, I’m Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council.
18594,CERSEI,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?"
18595,MAESTER PYCELLE,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Well, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King’s council. Of course, that was the Mad King. King Robert saw things differently."
18596,CERSEI,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," What about Myrcella’s death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?"
18597,JAIME,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne. We've got a lot to discuss. All of us together.
18598,CERSEI,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it."
18599,KEVAN,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," No, we cannot make you leave. And you cannot make us stay. Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all."
18600,HIGH SPARROW,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1," Oh, your Grace."
18601,TOMMEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, My mother would like to see her daughter’s final resting place.
18602,HIGH SPARROW,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1," Oh, I'm, sorry, your Grace. That’s not possible. Not yet."
18603,TOMMEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, When will it be possible?
18604,HIGH SPARROW,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, When she's fully atoned for her sins.
18605,TOMMEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, You’ve cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city. That wasn’t a full atonement?
18606,HIGH SPARROW,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1," No. She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins."
18607,TOMMEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, I want you to let her see Myrcella’s resting place.
18608,TOMMEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, I am the king.
18609,HIGH SPARROW,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, You are.
18610,TOMMEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, And what does that mean to you?
18611,HIGH SPARROW,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, It means a great deal to me. The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world. Do you know who told me that? Your mother.
18612,TOMMEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you’ve put her through?
18613,HIGH SPARROW,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1," How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother’s presence? It was through their own mothers. There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that. But when she speaks of you, the Mother’s love outshines it all. Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world. Because it doesn’t come from this world. But you know that. You’ve felt it. You’ve seen her when she talks to you."
18614,TOMMEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Yes.
18615,HIGH SPARROW,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, It’s a great gift. One I never had. Envy. One more thing for me to atone for.
18616,HIGH SPARROW,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1," You Grace, may I? Do you mind? It's my knees."
18617,TOMMEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Of course.
18618,HIGH SPARROW,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1," When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you."
18619,TOMMEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, I still don’t understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured.
18620,HIGH SPARROW,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, It’s not what I want. It’s what the gods want. They make their will known to us and it’s up to us to either accept or reject it.
18621,HIGH SPARROW,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Please.
18622,HIGH SPARROW,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1," If we’re to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings. A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can. And no one is wiser than the gods."
18623,TOMMEN,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, My grandfather once said something similar. Except for the part about the gods.
18624,HIGH SPARROW,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not. As they work through your mother. There’s so much good in all of us. The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.
18625,WAIF,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Who are you?
18626,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, No one.
18627,WAIF,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Who were you before you came here?
18628,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Arya Stark.
18629,WAIF,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Tell me about Arya Stark’s family.
18630,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1," Her father was Eddard Stark. Her mother was Catelyn Stark. She had one sister, Sansa, and four brothers."
18631,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Three brothers.
18632,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1," Rob, Bran, Rickon. And a half-brother, Jon."
18633,WAIF,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, And where are they now?
18634,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, They may be dead for all a girl knows.
18635,WAIF,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Tell me about The Hound.
18636,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Also dead.
18637,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Arya Stark left him to die. He was on her list.
18638,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, He was not on her list anymore. She’d taken him off it.
18639,WAIF,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Why? Didn’t she want him dead any longer?
18640,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, She did and she did not.
18641,WAIF,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, She sounds confused.
18642,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1," Yes, she was."
18643,WAIF,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Who else was on Arya Stark’s funny little list?
18644,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1," Cersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Walder Frey."
18645,WAIF,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, That’s a short list. That can’t be everyone you want to kill.
18646,WAIF,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Are you sure you’re not forgetting someone?
18647,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1, Which name would you like a girl to speak?
18648,JAQEN,6,53,oathbreaker,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER_1," If a girl tells me her name, I will give her eyes back."
18649,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER_1, A girl has no name.
18650,JAQEN,6,53,oathbreaker,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER_1, Come.
18651,JAQEN,6,53,oathbreaker,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER_1," If a girl is truly no one, she has nothing to fear."
18652,JAQEN,6,53,oathbreaker,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER_1, Who are you?
18653,ARYA,6,53,oathbreaker,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER_1, No one.
18654,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, The Umbers are a famously loyal house.
18655,LORD KARSTARK,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, Famously loyal to the Starks.
18656,SMALLJON,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1," And you, Lord Karstark? Your people share blood with the Starks, don’t they?  But here we are. Times change."
18657,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1," When my father became Warden of the North, your house refused to pledge their banners."
18658,SMALLJON,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, Your father was a cunt.
18659,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1," My beloved father, the Warden --"
18660,SMALLJON,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1," Your father was a cunt and that’s why you killed him.  I might’ve done the same to my father, if he hadn’t have done me the favor of dying on his own."
18661,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, My father was poisoned by our enemies.
18662,SMALLJON,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, Mmm.
18663,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1," Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?"
18664,SMALLJON,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1," The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.  We’re farther north than any of you fuckers. Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first.  I like fighting wildlings, been doing it all my life.  But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone."
18665,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, So now you’ve come seeking help?
18666,SMALLJON,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1," We need to help each other.  The colder it gets, the farther South those goat fuckers will roam. Won't take them long to get here."
18667,LORD KARSTARK,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?
18668,SMALLJON,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1," If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe.  He knows this place better than we ever will."
18669,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, Pledge your banners to House Bolton.  Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends.
18670,SMALLJON,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, I’m not kissing your fucking hand.
18671,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord.
18672,SMALLJON,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, I’m not doing that either.
18673,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, Why would I trust a man who won’t honor tradition?
18674,SMALLJON,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, Your father honored tradition. Knelt for Robb Stark. Called him King of the North. Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?
18675,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.
18676,SMALLJON,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths. I've got a gift for you.
18677,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1," A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads."
18678,SMALLJON,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1," A girl, aye.  A wild one."
18679,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, I like them wild.
18680,SMALLJON,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1," And the boy, nice and young. The way Karstark likes them."
18681,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, Who’s this?
18682,SMALLJON,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, Rickon Stark.
18683,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, How do I know that’s Rickon Stark?
18684,RAMSAY,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1," Welcome home, Lord Stark."
18685,DOLOROUS EDD,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1, It’s time.
18686,JON SNOW,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1," If you have any last words, now is the time."
18687,BOWEN MARSH,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1, You shouldn’t be alive. It’s not right.
18688,JON SNOW,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1, Neither was killing me.
18689,OTHELL YARWICK,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1, My mother's still living at White Harbor. Could you write her? Tell her I died fighting the wildings.
18690,ALLISER THRONE,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1," I had a choice, Lord Commander. Betray you or betray the Night’s Watch. You brought an army of wildlings into our lands. An army of muderers and raiders. If I had to do it all over knowing where I’d end up, I pray I’d make the right choice again."
18691,JON SNOW,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1," I’m sure you would, Ser Alliser."
18692,ALLISER THRONE,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1," I fought, I lost. Now I rest. But you, Lord Snow, you’ll be fighting their battles forever."
18693,DOLOROUS EDD,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1, We should burn the bodies.
18694,JON SNOW,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1, You should.
18695,DOLOROUS EDD,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1, What do you want me to do with this?
18696,JON SNOW,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1, Wear it. Burn it. Whatever you want. You have Castle Black.
18697,JON SNOW,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1, My watch is ended.
18698,DOLOROUS EDD,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_101, Where you gonna go?
18699,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_101, South.
18700,DOLOROUS EDD,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_101, What are you gonna do?
18701,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_101, Get warm.
18702,DOLOROUS EDD,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_101, I was with you at Hardhome. We saw what’s out there. We know it’s coming here. How can you leave us now?
18703,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_101, I did everything I could. You know that.
18704,DOLOROUS EDD,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_101, You swore a vow.
18705,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_101," Aye, I pledged my life to the Night’s Watch. I gave my life."
18706,DOLOROUS EDD,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_101, For all nights to come.
18707,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_101," They killed me, Edd! My own brothers. You want me to stay here after that?"
18708,MAN,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_101, Riders approaching!
18709,MAN #2,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_101, Open the gate!
18710,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, This is good soup. Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?
18711,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, With the peas and onions?
18712,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, Mmm.
18713,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, We never should have left Winterfell.
18714,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1," Don’t you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself, “Don’t go, you idiot.”"
18715,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, How could we know?
18716,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you. I wish I could change everything.
18717,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, We were children.
18718,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1," I was awful, just admit it."
18719,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, You were occasionally awful. I’m sure I can’t have been great fun. Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.
18720,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, Can you forgive me?
18721,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, There’s nothing to forgive.
18722,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, Forgive me.
18723,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1," All right. All right, I forgive you."
18724,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1," You’d think after thousands of years, the Night’s Watch would have learned how to make a good ale."
18725,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, Where will you go?
18726,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1," Where will we go? If I don’t watch over you, Father’s ghost will come back and murder me."
18727,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, Where will we go?
18728,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1," I can’t stay here, not after what happened."
18729,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, There’s only one place we can go. Home.
18730,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?
18731,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, We’ll take it back from them.
18732,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, I don’t have an army.
18733,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, How many wildlings did you save?
18734,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, They didn’t come here to serve me.
18735,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, They owe you their lives.
18736,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, You think they’ll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?
18737,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, Sansa.
18738,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1," Winterfell is our home. It’s ours and Arya’s and Bran’s and Rickon’s. Wherever they are, it belongs to our family. We have to fight for it."
18739,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, I’m tired of fighting.
18740,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1, It’s all I’ve done since I left home. I’ve killed brothers of the Night’s Watch. I’ve killed wildlings. I’ve killed men that I admire. I hanged a boy younger than Bran. I fought and I lost.
18741,SANSA,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1," If we don’t take back the North, we’ll never be safe. I want you to help me. But I’ll do it myself if I have to."
18742,DAVOS,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, My lady.
18743,MELISANDRE,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, Ser Davos.
18744,DAVOS,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, Will you stay here at Castle Black?
18745,MELISANDRE,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, I will do as Jon Snow commands.
18746,DAVOS,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, You serve Jon Snow now?
18747,MELISANDRE,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, He’s the prince that was promised.
18748,DAVOS,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis."
18749,DAVOS,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, What happened down there?
18750,MELISANDRE,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, There was a battle. Stannis was defeated.
18751,DAVOS,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, And Shireen? What happened to the princess?
18752,BRIENNE,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,  I saw what happened. I saw Stannis’ forces defeated in the field.
18753,DAVOS,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," My lady, I’m Ser Davos Seaworth."
18754,BRIENNE,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, We’ve met before. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic.
18755,DAVOS,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, That’s in the past now.
18756,BRIENNE,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," Yes, it’s in the past. It doesn’t mean I forget. Or forgive. He admitted it, you know."
18757,DAVOS,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, Who did?
18758,BRIENNE,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, Stannis. Just before I executed him.
18759,LITTLEFINGER,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, The Defender of the Vale!
18760,ROBIN,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, Uncle Petyr!
18761,LITTLEFINGER,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, My lord. Come and see.
18762,LITTLEFINGER,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, I missed your name day. Go on.
18763,ROBIN,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, A falcon!
18764,LITTLEFINGER,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, A gyrfalcon. The greatest and rarest of birds.
18765,YOHN ROYCE,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," Last time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers."
18766,LITTLEFINGER,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, Indeed I was.
18767,YOHN ROYCE,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," And yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell."
18768,LITTLEFINGER,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men. Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting."
18769,YOHN ROYCE,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, Do you take me for a fool?
18770,LITTLEFINGER,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else."
18771,YOHN ROYCE,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," Slander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him."
18772,LITTLEFINGER,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, Your home is the Vale. The Lord of the Vale stands before us. And only his judgment concerns me.
18773,ROBIN,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?
18774,YOHN ROYCE,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," My lord. My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn. To your father, to your mother, and now to you."
18775,ROBIN,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?"
18776,LITTLEFINGER,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," Lord Royce has served the Vale well. He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career. If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come."
18777,YOHN ROYCE,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord."
18778,LITTLEFINGER,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, I think he deserves one more chance. What do you say?
18779,ROBIN,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, Fine.
18780,LITTLEFINGER,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," I bring good news. My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell. I expect she’s headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander. But she won’t be safe there, not with the Boltons after her."
18781,ROBIN,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, She’s my cousin. We should help her.
18782,LITTLEFINGER,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, That was my instinct as well.
18783,LITTLEFINGER,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," Our lord has spoken. Gather the Knights of the Vale. The time has come to join the fray.EXT. MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE - DAYA ship is entering the harbor. TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are standing on the shore watching its approach."
18784,GREY WORM,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, You invite the enemy into our city?
18785,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," I did. As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”"
18786,GREY WORM,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, I don’t make peace with the queen’s enemies. I kill the queen’s enemies.
18787,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1," Yes, that’s the military approach. And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach."
18788,MISSANDEI,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her.
18789,MISSANDEI,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, How many days were you a slave?
18790,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, Long enough to know.
18791,MISSANDEI,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1, Not long enough to understand.
18792,YEZZAN,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor. And somehow you’ve risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen. It’s most impressive.
18793,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.Here’s to reversals of fortune.
18794,RAZDAL,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, We came here to meet the queen and instead we’re greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.
18795,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Let’s make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want."
18796,BELICHO,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, We want you to leave Slaver’s Bay. Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go.
18797,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Queen Daenerys won’t stay in Meereen forever. Her path takes her westward.
18798,RAZDAL,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs. She refused them."
18799,MISSANDEI,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains."
18800,RAZDAL,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, As they have since the dawn of time.
18801,GREY WORM,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Not anymore.
18802,YEZZAN,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, You think you’re a free man now? You still follow orders. Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn’t mean she’s not a master.
18803,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Friends, friends, friends, please."
18804,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing. That is the way of the world. I’m not here to change the way of the world.
18805,YEZZAN,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Slavery is the way of our world.
18806,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, You don’t need slaves to make money. There haven’t been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you. But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it. So here is the queen’s proposal. Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver’s Bay time to adjust to the new order.
18807,YEZZAN,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, What does that mean?
18808,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice."
18809,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices. In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy."
18810,YEZZAN,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.
18811,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same. I do hope you accept, my friends. You will not receive a better offer."
18812,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it. And as a parting gift to our honored guests…
18813,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Give freedom a chance. See if it doesn’t taste every bit as good as what came before.
18814,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time.
18815,MISSANDEI,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, Perhaps I should translate for you.
18816,MAN #1,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, We speak the Common Tongue.
18817,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, Excellent.
18818,MAN #2,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, You met with the slavers today.
18819,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, I did.
18820,MAN #1,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum. Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them.
18821,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.
18822,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, But I am not your ruler. I’m not the Breaker of Chains. I’m not the Unburnt. And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.
18823,MAN #1,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, You are a stranger here. So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?
18824,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, Because our queen chose me as her advisor. Until she returns from her travels --
18825,MAN #2,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, When does she return?
18826,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, Soon. You have my word.
18827,MAN #1,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, We don’t know you. We don’t trust you. We know Torgo Nudho. We fight with him against the Masters. We trust him.
18828,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations. As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace."
18829,MAN #2,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, You have made peace with the slavers?
18830,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, We offered terms.
18831,MAN #1,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," And you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers’ arms and sold us at auction like cattle?"
18832,GREY WORM,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," I am a soldier, not a politician. But if there is a chance for peace -- a just peace -- we should take it."
18833,MAN #2,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," Missandei, you know what these men are. How can you trust them?"
18834,MISSANDEI,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, I do not trust them. I will never trust them.
18835,MISSANDEI,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," But as a wise man once said, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”"
18836,GREY WORM,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, Do not use me for your lies.
18837,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, Those men respect you.
18838,GREY WORM,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, They respect me because they know who I am. They know I am loyal.
18839,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, As do I.
18840,GREY WORM,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1," I am loyal to my queen, not you. If you betray her work, you are my enemy."
18841,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.
18842,MISSANDEI,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, You promised the slavers they could keep slavery.
18843,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, For a short time.
18844,MISSANDEI,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, Seven years is not a short time for a slave.
18845,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, You’re right. Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once. War is a horror that should be ended at once. I can’t do both today.
18846,GREY WORM,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, You are wrong to trust these men.
18847,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, I don’t trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest. They’re trustworthy if they’re convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.
18848,GREY WORM,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, You don’t know them. You don’t understand them. We are not human in their eyes. They look at me and see a weapon. They look at her and see a whore.
18849,TYRION,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast. Their contempt is their weakness. They’ll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.
18850,GREY WORM,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, You will not use them. They will use you. That is what they do.
18851,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, You all right? Why don’t you sit and catch your breath?
18852,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, I’m fine.
18853,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1," I don’t think you could ride the dragon. 20 years ago, maybe."
18854,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, What?
18855,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1," Our queen. She’s wild, you know. Don’t let her size fool you. It’s hard enough for me and I’m a young man. You, I don’t think your heart could take it."
18856,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, Must make you angry that our queen chose me.
18857,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, Makes me sad. You’ll disappoint her before long. She’ll move on.
18858,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, We’ll all disappoint her before long.
18859,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, We need each other right now. After we’re done needing each other --
18860,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1," Oh, I don’t want to fight you, Jorah the Andal. What do I have to gain? If I win, I’m the shit who killed an old man. If I lose, I’m the shit who was killed by an old man."

18862,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, None.
18863,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1," The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway."
18864,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1," Eastern Market, Western Market. When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals. That’s where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen."

18866,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, It’s forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.

18872,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, I’m very attached to this knife.
18873,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, Don’t worry. it didn’t touch you.
18874,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, You know what happens?
18875,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, I know what happens.
18876,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1, I’ll do it myself.
18877,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1, I should have been born a Dothraki.
18878,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1, Come on.
18879,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1, My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost. Could you show us the way back?
18880,DOTHRAKI #1,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1, What do you sell?
18881,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1," Wine. Come down to my stall tomorrow, I’ll give you a cask of the Arbor’s finest."
18882,DOTHRAKI #1,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1, You’re not merchants.
18883,DOTHRAKI #1,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1, Get the others.
18884,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1," Told you, I’m very attached to this knife."
18885,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1, You all right?
18886,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1," If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us."
18887,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1, Huh.
18888,LEADER,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, Some of them don’t think Dothraki should breed with foreigners. They are stupid old women. They don’t realize that we have always diluted our blood. This one is Lhazareen. Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village. How old were you?
18889,LHAZAREEN WOMAN,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, Twelve.

18892,LEADER,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1," We are not queens here, but the khals depend on us for our wisdom. Our lives have meaning."

18894,LEADER,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1," When the khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night, I hope they let you live out your days with us. The other possibilities are not so pleasant."
18895,DAENERYS,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, I need to make water.
18896,LEADER,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, You can’t run from Dothraki. You know this.
18897,DAENERYS,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, I will never run from Dothraki.
18898,LEADER,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1," Go, show her."
18899,DAENERYS,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, I needed fresh air. The old women stink.
18900,LHAZAREEN WOMAN,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, They do stink.
18901,DAENERYS,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, You must have been very young when your Khal died.
18902,LHAZAREEN WOMAN,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, Sixteen.
18903,DAENERYS,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, Too bad he didn’t die sooner.
18904,LHAZAREEN WOMAN,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1," Yes, too bad."
18905,LHAZAREEN WOMAN,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, Is it true you have three dragons?
18906,DAENERYS,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, Mm-hmm.
18907,LHAZAREEN WOMAN,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, And they breathe fire?
18908,DAENERYS,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, They do. Would you like to see them one day?
18909,LHAZAREEN WOMAN,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1," I am Dosh Khaleen. I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die."
18910,DAENERYS,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1," No, don’t hurt her."
18911,DAARIO,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, She’ll give us away.
18912,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, We have to go now.
18913,DAENERYS,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive.
18914,JORAH,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, All we can do is try.
18915,DAENERYS,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, No. We can do more than that. And you’re going to help me.
18916,DAENERYS,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1," And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi. Do not betray me."
18917,HIGH SPARROW,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1," If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go? What would you seek out?"
18918,MARGAERY,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1," I’d go to my brother, my husband, my family."
18919,HIGH SPARROW,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1," Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power. Seeking out your family means seeking out sin. I’m not maligning you. I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else. My father was a cobbler. He died with I was young and I took over his shop. He was a simple man and he made simple shoes. But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them. Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time. Time most of all. Dozens of hours spent on a single pair."
18920,MARGAERY,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, Quality takes time.
18921,HIGH SPARROW,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1," Yes. I imagine you’ve worn a year of someone’s life on your back. The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege. I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself. Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better."
18922,MARGAERY,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1," And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness. Book of the Stranger, verse 25."
18923,HIGH SPARROW,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, You know The Seven-Pointed Star.
18924,MARGAERY,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.
18925,HIGH SPARROW,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1," Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people. You’re close. But it wasn’t a graveyard. It was a feast. I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all. We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor. I woke before dawn. I could barely stand. Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes. The truth of their bodies laid bare. I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn. And I saw it with perfect clarity. I saw what my sins were. The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position. It was all part of a story. A story I was telling myself about who I was. A collection of lies that would disappear in the light. The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was."
18926,MARGAERY,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, So what did you do?
18927,HIGH SPARROW,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, I left to go and find them. I didn’t even put on my shoes. I walked out the door and never went back.
18928,HIGH SPARROW,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1," Come, let’s go and see him."
18929,MARGAERY,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, Who?
18930,HIGH SPARROW,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1, Your brother.
18931,MARGAERY,6,54,book of the stranger,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR – LORAS’ CELL_1, Loras. Loras.
18932,MARGAERY,6,54,book of the stranger,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR – LORAS’ CELL_1, Listen to me. You need to stay strong.
18933,LORAS,6,54,book of the stranger,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR – LORAS’ CELL_1, I can’t stay strong. I never was strong.
18934,MARGAERY,6,54,book of the stranger,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR – LORAS’ CELL_1," You are strong. You are the future of our house, the future of our family."
18935,LORAS,6,54,book of the stranger,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR – LORAS’ CELL_1, I don’t care about that.
18936,MARGAERY,6,54,book of the stranger,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR – LORAS’ CELL_1, Shh. Have you -- have you told them that? That you don’t care?
18937,LORAS,6,54,book of the stranger,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR – LORAS’ CELL_1, I just want it to stop. Help me.
18938,MARGAERY,6,54,book of the stranger,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR – LORAS’ CELL_1," They want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. That’s why he’s letting me see you, I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win."
18939,LORAS,6,54,book of the stranger,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR – LORAS’ CELL_1, Let them win. Just make it stop. Please.
18940,MARGAERY,6,54,book of the stranger,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR – LORAS’ CELL_1, All right.
18941,MAESTER PYCELLE,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1," And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace. Not setting them off, that’s the most important thing. You are beset with enemies both within and without."
18942,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1, What are you doing here?
18943,MAESTER PYCELLE,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1, I am advising the king on our current predicament.
18944,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1, Leave.
18945,MAESTER PYCELL,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1, I am a member of the Small Council. The king’s small --
18946,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1, Is this a Small Council meeting?
18947,MAESTER PYCELL,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1, Obviously not. I’m here to lend my wisdom and my support.
18948,TOMMEN,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1," Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now."
18949,MAESTER PYCELL,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1, Your Grace.
18950,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1," Since I’ve missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things."
18951,TOMMEN,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1, I’ve been thinking about the High Sparrow.
18952,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1," As have we all, unfortunately."
18953,TOMMEN,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1, We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can’t put her at risk. He’s dangerous.
18954,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1, Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king’s own mother?
18955,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1, It’s all right. It's done. It’s in the past. And of course Margaery’s safety is paramount.
18956,TOMMEN,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1," You don’t like Margaery, do you?"
18957,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1," Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone’s. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing."
18958,TOMMEN,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1, Mother...there’s something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.
18959,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1, You’ve spoken with him?
18960,TOMMEN,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1, I promised him I wouldn’t tell anyone. If he found out I told --
18961,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER_1," It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me."
18962,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king’s orders.
18963,LADY OLENNA,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You’re not welcome.
18964,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one’s rivals.
18965,LADY OLENNA,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What’s left to work with?"
18966,JAIME,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king’s ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
18967,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he’ll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city."
18968,LADY OLENNA,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Oh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen."
18969,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, I agree.
18970,JAIME,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," You’ve got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery’s humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody."
18971,KEVAN,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen’s safety.
18972,JAIME,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"  You’ll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?"
18973,KEVAN,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," No, but if the king should call on me --"
18974,JAIME,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"  The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen’s side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?"
18975,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they’ve done to your son.  Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
18976,KEVAN,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Of course I want him back.
18977,CERSEI,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
18978,KEVAN,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," If it doesn’t go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We’ll have civil war. Many will die."
18979,LADY OLENNA,6,54,book of the stranger,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Many will die no matter what we do. Better them than us.EXT. IRON ISLANDS - HARBORTHEON approaches Pyke Castle by boat.
18980,YARA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1," They told me you were home and I didn’t believe it. “Theon Greyjoy?” I said. “He’s dead. He’s been dead a long time."" He let you go?"
18981,THEON,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, I escaped.
18982,YARA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, I can’t hear you.
18983,THEON,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, I escaped.
18984,YARA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, Look at me. Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you. Good men. My men.
18985,THEON,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, I’m sorry.
18986,YARA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1," You were my brother. You’re a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me."
18987,THEON,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, I know. I know and I’m sorry.
18988,YARA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, Stop saying that.
18989,THEON,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, He broke me. He broke me into a thousand pieces.
18990,YARA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, I know.
18991,THEON,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, You don’t know.
18992,YARA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, He send us one of those pieces. That’s why I came for you.
18993,YARA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, Why did you come here?
18994,THEON,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, Where else could I go?
18995,YARA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, You heard father was dead and thought you’d claim the crown?
18996,THEON,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1," No, no. I only heard he died after we docked."
18997,YARA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?
18998,THEON,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, I didn’t know.
18999,YARA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you’ve done?
19000,THEON,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, I don’t want to be king.
19001,YARA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, What do you want?
19002,THEON,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, I should’ve listened to you. You’re the only one --
19003,YARA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, That doesn’t matter anymore. Stop crying.  Look at me. Tell me what you want.
19004,THEON,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, You should rule the Iron Islands. Let me help you.
19005,RAMSAY,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, They've cleaned you up nicely. You know who I am?
19006,OSHA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, A lord?
19007,RAMSAY,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, Yes. A lord. You’ve seen my banners?

19017,RAMSAY,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1," Be that as it may, Rickon's not yours to sell anymore. He’s mine. So what use could I possibly have for you?"
19018,OSHA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, I can give you what you want.
19019,RAMSAY,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, Are you sure you know what that is?

19024,OSHA,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, That so?
19025,RAMSAY,6,54,book of the stranger,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL_1, I had to work hard to get him talking. But he talked. They all do.

19032,JON SNOW,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK – MESS HALL_1," ""To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon."

19059,KHAL #4,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK – MESS HALL_1," The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her. They’re offering ten thousand horses In exchange. What's worth more, one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?"

19062,KHAL MORO,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK – MESS HALL_1, You’d rather be sold to slavery? Or maybe you’d like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?
19063,DAENERYS,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK – MESS HALL_1, No. I don’t want either of those things.
19064,KHAL MORO,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK – MESS HALL_1," We don’t care what you want. This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen. You have no voice here, unless you are Dosh Khaleen. Which you are not, until we decide you are."
19065,DAENERYS,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK – MESS HALL_1, I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.

To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.
19068,KHAL MORO,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK – MESS HALL_1, And you were dumb enough to believe him?
19069,DAENERYS,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK – MESS HALL_1," And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you’ll raid, how many girls you’ll get to fuck, how many horses you’ll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will."
19070,KHAL MORO,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK – MESS HALL_1, All right. No Dosh Khaleen for you. Instead we’ll take turns fucking you. And then we’ll let our bloodriders fuck you.
19071,KHAL MORO,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK – MESS HALL_1," And If there’s anything left of you, we’ll give our horses a turn. You crazy cunt. Did you really think we would serve you?"

19076,LITTLEFINGER,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1," Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed."
19077,SANSA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, Unharmed? What are you doing here?
19078,LITTLEFINGER,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They’re encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.
19079,SANSA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1," To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn’t know, you’re an idiot. If you did know, you’re my enemy."
19080,SANSA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1," Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark’s daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?"
19081,LITTLEFINGER,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, I can’t begin to contemplate --
19082,SANSA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, What do you think he did to me?
19083,BRIENNE,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, Lady Sansa asked you a question.
19084,LITTLEFINGER,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, He beat you.

19088,LITTLEFINGER,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, Did he cut you?
19089,SANSA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
19090,LITTLEFINGER,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, I didn’t know.
19091,SANSA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, I thought you knew everyone’s secrets.
19092,LITTLEFINGER,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1," I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger."
19093,SANSA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1," The other things he did, ladies aren’t supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I don’t mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now."
19094,LITTLEFINGER,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, I’m so sorry.
19095,SANSA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, You said you would protect me.
19096,LITTLEFINGER,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
19097,SANSA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, I don’t believe you anymore. I don’t need you anymore. You can’t protect me. You won’t even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn’t I?
19098,LITTLEFINGER,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1," Do you want me to beg for my life? If that’s what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do."
19099,SANSA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, What if I want you to die here and now?
19100,LITTLEFINGER,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, Then I will die.
19101,SANSA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.
19102,LITTLEFINGER,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, I would do anything to undo what’s been done to you. I know that I can’t. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.
19103,SANSA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, I have an army.
19104,LITTLEFINGER,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, Your brother’s army.
19105,LITTLEFINGER,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, Half-brother.
19106,WAIF,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, You’re not ready. You should go home before it’s too late.
19107,WAIF,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1," You’ll never be one of us, Lady Stark."
19108,JAQEN,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, She has a point.
19109,JAQEN,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies. They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.
19110,ARYA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, Who was the first?
19111,JAQEN,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1," He was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled."
19112,ARYA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, Where did they go?
19113,JAQEN,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1," Here. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires."
19114,ARYA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, A girl has no desires.
19115,ARYA,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1, Who?
19116,JAQEN,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1," An actress who calls herself Lady Crane. She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square. A girl has been given a second chance. There will not be a third. One way or another, a face will be added to the hall."
19117,IZEMBARO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, Ahh!
19118,IZEMBARO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1," Oh, murdered by a boar. The great big hairy whore. He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon I am no more."
19119,CLARENZO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1," Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie. I love you, Father. Please don’t die."
19120,IZEMBARO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1," Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine."
19121,LADYC RANE,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1," I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land. And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand. Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace? To whom will he turn when it’s time to learn to look darkness in the face?"
19122,IZEMBARO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, Ned stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.
19123,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1," Ooh! Ooh, what’s happened here, then?"
19124,BOBONO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1," He brought you here, Ned Stark, ‘cause you’re the brightest fellow in the land. You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand."
19125,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, We men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful.
19126,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1," I’d ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful."
19127,IZEMBARO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1," I die! I die! And here I now must lie. Oh, woe. Oh, no. Oh, I am about to go."
19128,LADY CRANE,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, Will you stay on as Joffrey’s Hand?
19129,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, The Iron Throne’s what I demand.
19130,LADY CRANE,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, You cannot.
19131,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, I can.
19132,LADY CRANE,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, You will not.
19133,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, I will.
19134,LADY CRANE,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, You dare not.
19135,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, I dare yes.
19136,LADY CRANE,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, The line of succession.
19137,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, What’s that mean?
19138,LADY CRANE,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, The proper progression.
19139,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, What’s that mean?
19140,LADY CRANE,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, The lawful ascension.
19141,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, What’s that mean?
19142,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1," So move along, give me my chair and there won’t be no more trouble."
19143,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, But we had a deal all done and dusted.
19144,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, I’m starting to think you can’t be trusted.
19145,BIANCA,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, Save my father.
19146,LADY CRANE,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.
19147,BIANCA,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1," Save him, please."
19148,LADY CRANE,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, Show him mercy. Show the people what a good king should be.
19149,CLARENZO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1," Good people, you may all relax. My father’s friend shall be spared the —"
19150,BIANCA,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1," Father! No! Oh, father."
19151,BOBONO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1," Worry not! All is well. I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister, the richest man you’ll see. He proclaims me Hand of the King. The position’s mine for life. And he’s give me permission to take Sansa as my wife."
19152,BOBONO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1, You’ll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite.
19153,BOBONO,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1," So let’s forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night."
19154,CLARENZO,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1, It’s a wart. Two warts. I’ve got two fucking warts on my cock.
19155,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1," Well, don’t worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years."
19156,CAMELLO,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1," Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me."
19157,IZEMBARO,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1," You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do."
19158,BIANCA,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1, I had two lines.
19159,IZEMBARO,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1, There are no small parts. You rang very false.
19160,BIANCA,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1, I rang very false?
19161,BOBONO,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1," What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true."
19162,BIANCA,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1, You weren’t complaining about me last night.
19163,BOBONO,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1," May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?"

19166,LADY CRANE,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1, It’s only a matter of time.
19167,LADY CRANE,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1, To our children.
19168,BOBONO,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1, May they have your talent.
19169,LADY CRANE,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1, And your filthy mind.
19170,ARYA,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1, A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
19171,ARYA,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1, If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…
19172,JAQEN,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1, A girl is not ready.
19173,ARYA,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1, She’s a good actress.
19174,JAQEN,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1, So a man has heard.
19175,ARYA,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1, Seems like a decent woman.
19176,JAQEN,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1, Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
19177,ARYA,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1, No. Who wants her dead?
19178,JAQEN,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1, That does not matter. The price was paid.
19179,ARYA,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1, The younger actress. She’s jealous because Lady Crane is better.
19180,JAQEN,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1, A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.
19181,ARYA,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1, A girl has decided.
19182,JAQEN,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1, A servant does not ask questions.INT. GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVEBRAN is clinging to the roots of the tree. His eyes are glazed white.
19183,MAN,6,55,the door,VISION OF THE PAST - UNKNOWN LAND_1, No! No! No!
19184,BRAN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_5, It was you. You made the White Walkers.
19185,LEAF,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_5, We were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.
19186,BRAN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_5, From whom?
19187,LEAF,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_5, From you. From men.
19188,AERON,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_5, We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?
19189,YARA,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_5," I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne."
19190,MAN #1,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_5, We’ve never had a queen. Not once.
19191,YARA,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_5," There are many things we’ve never done. We’ve never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist."
19192,ALL,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_5, Aye!
19193,YARA,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_5, We are a sea people.
19194,ALL,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_5, Aye!
19195,YARA,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_5, Our god is a sea god.

19197,MAN #2,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, You shall not be queen!
19198,YARA,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, I am not finished!
19199,MAN #2,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104," Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us. Not when Balon’s own male heir has returned."
19200,THEON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, I am Theon Greyjoy...last living son of Balon Greyjoy.
19201,THEON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104," And she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is."
19202,ALL,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, Aye!
19203,THEON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, She is a reaver!
19204,ALL,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, Aye!
19205,THEON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, She is a warrior!
19206,ALL,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, Aye!
19207,THEON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, She is ironborn!
19208,ALL,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, Aye!
19209,THEON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, We will find no better leader. This is our queen.
19210,EURON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, I’m Euron Greyjoy.
19211,EURON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, I claim the Salt Throne.
19212,EURON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, Niece.
19213,EURON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, Nephew. Little Theon.
19214,EURON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn’t keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.
19215,EURON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, Explains why you think a woman can be king.
19216,YARA,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104," When did you return, Uncle?"
19217,EURON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
19218,YARA,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, I’m glad you’re here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.
19219,EURON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren’t for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn’t win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
19220,THEON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104," That would have been hard to do. You weren’t here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time."
19221,EURON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?
19222,EURON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
19223,THEON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
19224,EURON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, And how will she do that?
19225,YARA,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104, I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
19226,EURON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_104," Right idea, except I’m the one who’s going to build the Iron Fleet because I’m the one who knows how to use it. I’ve been all over the world. I’ve seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I’m going to build that fleet and I’m going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock."
19227,EURON,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_106, I’m not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we’re going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn’t born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.
19228,AERON,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1," May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
19229,AERSON,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.
19230,AERON,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.
19231,AERON,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1," What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger."
19232,AERON,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, What is dead may never die.
19233,ALL,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, What is dead may never die.
19234,EURON,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, Where are my niece and nephew? Let’s go murder them.
19235,AERON,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, They stole our best ships.
19236,EURON,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, Won’t be enough to save them.
19237,EURON,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1," Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.EXT. VAES DOTHRAK - CLIFFSDAENERYS stands at the edge of the cliff, looking out at Vaes Dothrak. She turns to face JORAH and DAARIO, who are standing behind her."
19238,DAENERYS,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can’t take you back and I can’t send you away.
19239,JORAH,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, You must send me away.
19240,DAENERYS,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, Is there a cure?
19241,JORAH,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, I don’t know.
19242,DAENERYS,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, How long does it take?
19243,JORAH,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, I don’t know that either. But I’ve seen what happens when it goes far enough. I’ll end things before that.
19244,DAENERYS,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
19245,JORAH,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1," Don’t be. All I’ve ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I’ll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi."
19246,DAENERYS,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1," Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal."
19247,DAENERYS,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1, You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
19248,DAENERYS,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1," Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side."
19249,VARYS,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1," In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?"
19250,GREY WORM,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1, None.
19251,VARYS,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1, And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
19252,GREY WORM,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1," Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing."
19253,VARYS,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1, So it’s safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
19254,GREY WORM,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1, For now.
19255,VARYS,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1, For now is the best we get in our profession.
19256,TYRION,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1, It’s not enough.
19257,VARYS,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1," Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I’d say it’s a good start."
19258,TYRION,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1," It’s not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that."
19259,MISSANDEI,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1, The people know who brought them freedom.
19260,TYRION,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1," Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced."
19261,VARYS,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1, Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
19262,TYRION,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1, Who said anything about “him”?
19263,MAN,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3," You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light."
19264,TYRION,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, Welcome to Meereen.
19265,TYRION,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, That’s about the extent of my Valyrian.
19266,TYRION,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
19267,TYRION,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
19268,KINVARA,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, You don’t need to persuade me. I came to help.
19269,KINVARA,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
19270,TYRION,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, Yes.
19271,KINVARA,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
19272,TYRION,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, She did indeed.
19273,KINVARA,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3," Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven’t you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away."
19274,TYRION,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, Ideally we’d avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
19275,KINVARA,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3," You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she’s gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed."
19276,TYRION,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, I’d settle for obeyed.
19277,KINVARA,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
19278,TYRION,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, That sounds most excellent --
19279,VARYS,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3," A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King’s Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he’d been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good."
19280,TYRION,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, We’d be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
19281,VARYS,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, I suppose it’s hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn’t that the whole point of being a fanatic? You’re always right. Everything is the Lord’s will.
19282,KINVARA,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, Everything is the Lord’s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
19283,VARYS,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3," And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?"
19284,TYRION,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3," My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen."
19285,KINVARA,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3," Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn’t be here helping the Lord’s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there’s still so much you don’t know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?"
19286,KINVARA,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3, Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
19287,KINVARA,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3," We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me."
19288,BRAN,6,55,the door,VISION OF THE PAST - UNKNOWN LAND_3, What?
19289,BRAN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," He saw me, the Night King! He saw me!"
19290,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, He touched you.
19291,BRAN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," I don’t know. He was close, but --"
19292,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, He touched you.
19293,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, He knows you are here. He’ll come for you.
19294,BRAN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, But he can’t get in.
19295,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," He can now. His mark is on you. You must leave, all of you."
19296,MEERA,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge."
19297,HODOR,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, Hodor.
19298,BRAN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.
19299,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, The time has come.
19300,BRAN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, The time for what?
19301,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, For you to become me.
19302,BRAN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, But am I ready?
19303,THREE-EYED RAVEN,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, No.
19304,JON SNOW,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men."
19305,DAVOS,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys."
19306,DAVOS,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we’re not doing so well there."
19307,SANSA,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.
19308,DAVOS,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don’t think we can count on them either."
19309,SANSA,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?"
19310,DAVOS,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," Precious little, my lady."
19311,SANSA,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders."
19312,DAVOS,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They’re more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don’t want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon’s going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it’s a fight they can win."
19313,JON SNOW,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build."
19314,SANSA,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay’s own door."
19315,DAVOS,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, I don’t doubt it. But Jon doesn’t have the Stark name.
19316,SANSA,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," No, but I do."
19317,SANSA,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark’s son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton’s. Ant there are also the Tullys. They’re not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question."
19318,DAVOS,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, I didn’t know the Tullys still had an army.
19319,SANSA,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
19320,JON SNOW,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, How do you know that?
19321,SANSA,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7, Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
19322,DAVOS,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7," That’s good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side."
19323,BRIENNE,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3," I’ve sworn to protect you, my lady."
19324,SANSA,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3, You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.
19325,BRIENNE,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3, We can send the Blackfish a raven.
19326,SANSA,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3, Can’t risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.
19327,SANSA,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3, Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you’ll know how to talk to him.
19328,SANSA,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3, What is it?
19329,BRIENNE,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3, I don’t like leaving you here alone.
19330,SANSA,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3, With Jon?
19331,BRIENNE,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3," Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that’s understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --"
19332,SANSA,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3," Jon isn’t Tormund. Jon isn’t Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He’s my brother. He’ll keep me safe. I trust him."
19333,BRIENNE,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3, Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
19334,JON SNOW,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_5, New dress?
19335,SANSA,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_5, I made it myself. Do you like it?
19336,JON SNOW,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_5," Year, it’s -- I like the wolf bit."
19337,SANSA,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_5," Good, because I made this for you."
19338,SANSA,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_5, I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.
19339,JON SNOW,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_5," Thank you, Sansa."

19344,MAN,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_5," Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?"
19345,DOLOROUS EDD,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_5, I’m not the Lord Comman --

19392,BRAN,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_107, Meera. They found us.
19393,MEERA,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_107, I’m so sorry.
19394,RIDER,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_107," Come with me, now."
19395,RIDER,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_107, The dead don’t rest.
19396,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_107, It’s so green.
19397,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_107," Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer’s over, you’ll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you’ll find more green here than anywhere else."
19398,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_107, You’re nervous. You’re a nervous talker.
19399,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_107, That’s not any better being a nervous mute.
19400,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_107," I didn’t think I’d ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn’t. A person just doesn’t feel welcome at that point."
19401,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_107, And I certainly didn’t expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
19402,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_107, That Little Sam is your baby.
19403,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_107," Yes, now that’s very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he’ll take you in. He’ll get an education. He’ll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?"
19404,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_109, I told them I met you in the North.
19405,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_109, Did you tell them how far north?
19406,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_109," Well, it wasn’t a very large piece of parchment."
19407,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_109, You didn’t tell them where I’m really from? You didn’t tell them I’m a wildling?
19408,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_109," The thing is...my father doesn’t like wildlings. He hoped I’d make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it’s probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible."
19409,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_109, I think we’re here.
19410,MELESSA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1," Sam. Oh, Sam."
19411,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1," Oh, hello, Mother."
19412,MELESSA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1, I never thought I’d see you again. You look wonderful.
19413,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1, Oh.
19414,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1," Talla? Gods, you’re a woman now."
19415,TALLA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1, Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway. He has yellow teeth- -
19416,MELESSA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1," That’s enough, Talla."
19417,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1," Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly."
19418,MELESSA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1," Oh, my. You are lovely."
19419,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1," I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly."
19420,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1," Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell."
19421,MELESSA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1," Hello, little one. It’s me, your grandmother."
19422,MELESSA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1, May I hold him?
19423,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1," Yes, of course."
19424,MELESSA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1," You have a curious mind, I can tell. You’ll be a scholar like your father."
19425,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1, Where is Father? And Dickon?
19426,MELESSA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1, They’re on a hunt. They’ll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.
19427,TALLA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1," Come, you’ll be wanting a bath after all that travel. Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine. What’s your color? Midnight blue or silver? Silver, maybe. Come. You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELORTOMMEN and the HIGH SPARROW are standing in the central chamber. TOMMEN lights a candle."
19428,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1, Is there no other way?
19429,HIGH SPARROW,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1, You’re afraid for her?
19430,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1, Of course I’m afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
19431,HIGH SPARROW,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1, She’ll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn’t your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She’s truly opened her heart to them.
19432,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1, She’s always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
19433,HIGH SPARROW,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1, And now she’s devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?
19434,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3, Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?
19435,MARGAERY,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3," No, Your Grace."
19436,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3, I’ve missed you. More than you could know.
19437,MARGAERY,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3, We’ll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.
19438,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3, Better how? Soon the- - walk of atonement. He says there’s no other way.
19439,MARGAERY,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3," Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?"
19440,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3," Yes, a few times. Have you?"
19441,MARGAERY,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3," Yes, I have. He’s not quite what we thought he was, is he?"
19442,MARGAERY,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3, You think I’m mad. I sound mad.
19443,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3," No. No, you don’t. You- - you could never. You’re right, he’s not. He’s a lot more- -"
19444,MARGAERY,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3, He is. There’s something about him. His way of looking at the world. It’s not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It’s taken me a while. He’s helped me.
19445,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3, What are you talking about? You’re a good person. You’ve always been a good person. You’re the best person I know.
19446,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3, I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
19447,MARGAERY,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3," Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I’ve had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories."
19448,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3, I don’t understand.
19449,MARGAERY,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3, It’s all right. It really is. It’s such a relief to let go of those lies.
19450,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3, What about Loras?
19451,MARGAERY,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3," I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don’t erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all.INT. HORN HILL - HALLWAYSAM paces. GILLY enters on the far end of the hall. She is wearing a dress and her hair is done up."
19452,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3, It’s hard to walk in this.
19453,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3, It’s beautiful. You’re beautiful.
19454,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1," This venison, it’s very tasty. Is it from today’s hunt?"
19455,DICKON,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1," Well, no. We haven’t been able to cure that one yet. This is last week’s."
19456,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1," Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey."
19457,DICKON,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.
19458,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1," Oh, that’s a fair distance."
19459,DICKON,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, So do you do much hunting up at the wall?
19460,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1," Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don’t hunt, you don’t eat."
19461,DICKON,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
19462,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1," Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it’s my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She’s- - she’s quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress."
19463,MELESSA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1," I imagine it’s common where you’re from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn’t it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt."
19464,TALLA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
19465,RANDYLL,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, That’s enough of that.
19466,MELESSA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1," Samwell, would you care for more bread?"
19467,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1," Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother."
19468,RANDYLL,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, Not fat enough already?
19469,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -
19470,RANDYLL,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, I read your letter. You’re to be a maester.
19471,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1," Yes. And once I have my chain, I’ll return to Castle Black."
19472,RANDYLL,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, I thought the Night’s Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.
19473,RANDYLL,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I’ll wager you still can’t sit a horse or wield a sword.
19474,MELESSA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1," Randyll, to be maester of the Night’s Watch is a great honor."
19475,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.
19476,DICKON,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, There’s no such thing.
19477,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker’s heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He’s a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
19478,RANDYLL,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How’d you come to meet my son?
19479,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, The Night’s Watch came to our keep.
19480,RANDYLL,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, Where?
19481,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, Gilly.
19482,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, North of the Wall.
19483,RANDYLL,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, North of the Wall? You’re a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?
19484,RANDYLL,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1," It’s called Heartsbane. It’s been in our family for 500 years. It’s Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It’s supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole’s Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn’t you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home."
19485,MELESSA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1," Come, my dear. Talla."
19486,MELESSA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, I’ve lost my appetite.
19487,RANDYLL,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, He dishonors us.
19488,MELESSA,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1, You dishonor yourself.
19489,RANDYLL,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1," Your mother’s a fine woman. You’re not worthy of her. To please her, I’ll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill."
19490,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1, I’m sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he’d turn you and Little Sam away.
19491,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1, I’m not angry at you. I’m angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?
19492,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1, First light.
19493,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1, Say good-bye to him for me.
19494,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1," You’re not what he thinks you are, Sam. He doesn’t know what you are."
19495,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1," Good-bye, Gilly."
19496,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1, Sam?
19497,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1, We’re leaving.
19498,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1, What?
19499,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1, Get your things.
19500,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1, I don’t have any things.
19501,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1, What are you doing?
19502,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1, We belong together. All of us.
19503,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, What about your mother and sister?
19504,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1," Oh, they’ll understand."
19505,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, Your sister’s dress.
19506,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, She won’t mind. Looks better on you anyway.
19507,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, Sam. That’s your father’s sword.
19508,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, It’s my family’s sword.
19509,GILLY,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, Sam. Won’t he come for it?
19510,SAM,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, He can bloody well try.
19511,CLARENZO,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, The lion and the rose are one. I thank the gods above.
19512,CLARENZO,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1," And to you, my beauteous bridge, I pledge undying love."
19513,ALL,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.
19514,CLARENZO,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1," I’ll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer. Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?"
19515,BOBONO,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1," Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine."
19516,BOBONO,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, The last drink he shall ever take. And vengeance shall be mine.
19517,CLARENZO,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, Poison! Murder! I gasp. I- - I die.
19518,CLARENZO,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, I limp. And it was he…
19519,CLARENZO,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, ...that poisoned me. My evil Uncle Imp.
19520,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1," My firstborn son. My golden lion foully, falsely slain. I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain."
19521,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1," Hear my prayer, O cruel gods. Take my life instead. For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead. Oh, woe. Oh grief."
19522,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1," Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow. All hope is lost. All joy is gone. And there is no tomorrow."
19523,BOBONO,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, What is that I hear and smell? Someone I’ll soon send to hell.
19524,BOBONO,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, It’s time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
19525,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1, You beast. You beast. You killed my wife and now you’ve taken your father’s life.
19526,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_1, No worse child ever stained this land.
19527,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE_1, Curse the day I named you.
19528,BOBONO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE_1, My greatest crime. Now I must flee.
19529,BOBONO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_3, Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.
19530,BOBONO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_3, Don’t fear the winter.
19531,BOBONO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE_3, Fear me!
19532,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_5," Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca, Clarenzo."
19533,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE_5, I give you Bobono.
19534,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE_5, I give you Camello.
19535,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7," And last but not least, sweet Lady Crane."
19536,CAMELLO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That’s a dear.
19537,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, That crowd was shit.
19538,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, Girl.
19539,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, What are you doing back here?
19540,ARYA,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, Nothing.
19541,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, I saw you the other day in the audience. How many times have you seen this stupid play?
19542,ARYA,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, Three times.
19543,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, Did you pay?
19544,ARYA,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, No.
19545,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7," I remember when the players came to my village. I didn’t have any money, so I snuck in. Just like you. Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other’s arms. I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back."
19546,ARYA,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, You’re very good.
19547,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, My final speech is shit.
19548,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7," But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing’s no good."
19549,ARYA,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7," So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you."
19550,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, How would you change it?
19551,ARYA,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn’t just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
19552,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, What’s your name?
19553,ARYA,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, Mercy.
19554,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7," You have very expressive eyes, Mercy."
19555,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, Wonderful eyebrows. Do you like pretending to be other people?
19556,ARYA,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, I have to go. My father’s waiting for me.
19557,BIANCA,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7," Lady Crane, they loved you."
19558,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, They were sweet. Or drunk. Drunkenly sweet.
19559,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, No laugh for Ned’s death. These people are worse than animals.
19560,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, But they loved her. They all love her.
19561,CAMELLO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7," Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike."
19562,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, I do what I can with what I’m given.
19563,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, With what you’re given?
19564,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7," Well, I was thinking- -"
19565,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7," Oh, we’re all thinkers now, are we?"
19566,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, Full to the tits with ideas.
19567,LADY CRANE,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, I didn’t mean- -
19568,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7," You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I’ve been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I’m doing."
19569,IZEMBARO,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, You have no right to an opinion.
19570,ARYA,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7, Careful of that one. She wants you dead.
19571,JAQEN,6,56,blood of my blood,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING CHAMBER_1, And?
19572,WAIF,6,56,blood of my blood,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING CHAMBER_1, As I expected.
19573,JAQEN,6,56,blood of my blood,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING CHAMBER_1, A shame. A girl had many gifts.
19574,WAIF,6,56,blood of my blood,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING CHAMBER_1, You promised me.
19575,JAQEN,6,56,blood of my blood,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING CHAMBER_1, Don’t let her suffer.
19576,MACE,6,56,blood of my blood,UNKNOWN ALLEY_1, My lord.
19577,JAIME,6,56,blood of my blood,UNKNOWN ALLEY_1, My lord.
19578,MACE,6,56,blood of my blood,UNKNOWN ALLEY_1," My friends, the hour has come. Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children. But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came. Madness has had its day!"
19579,CAPTAIN,6,56,blood of my blood,UNKNOWN ALLEY_1," Forward, march!"
19580,HIGH SPARROW,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1," Rich or poor, noble or common, if we win, we must atone. Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner. She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied. She turned a blind eye to her brother’s sins. She disgraces her house, the king, and herself."
19581,CAPTAIN,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1," Company, halt! Face front! Turn!"
19582,HIGH SPARROW,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1, Lord Tyrell.
19583,HIGH SPARROW,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1, Ser Jaime.
19584,JAIME,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1, Sorry to interrupt. We’re here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we’ll be on our way.
19585,HIGH SPARROW,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1, I don’t have the authority to give them to you. And you don’t have the authority to take them.
19586,CAPTAIN,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1, Lock spears!
19587,JAIME,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1," I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name."
19588,HIGH SPARROW,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1, The gods don’t recognize his authority in this matter.
19589,JAIME,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1, You already insulted one great house. It won’t happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.
19590,HIGH SPARROW,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1, To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.
19591,CAPTAIN,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1, Order up!
19592,HIGH SPARROW,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1, Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.
19593,HIGH SPARROW,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1, Together we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.
19594,WOMAN,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1," Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!"
19595,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1, The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests. Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.
19596,MACE,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1, What’s happening?
19597,OLENNA,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1, He’s beaten us. That’s what’s happening.
19598,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown. Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard."
19599,JAIME,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, I’ve been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don’t have to do this. You don’t have to do anything.
19600,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, I have to answer to the gods.
19601,JAIME,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Not when you’re sitting in that chair.
19602,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, The Crown’s decision on this matter is final.
19603,JAIME,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods’ mercy?
19604,TOMMEN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.THE CROSSING - DINING HALLWALDER FREY is sitting in a high chair addressing two of his sons, BLACK WALDER and LOTHAR. One of his young daughter stands beside him. Many other family members sit at the tables, eating."
19605,WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, You’ve lost it?
19606,BLACK WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," Yes, father."
19607,WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," It’s a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn’t lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you."
19608,LOTHAR,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.
19609,WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn’t find him. That’s what it means to lose something. Now he’s come back and taken Riverrun."
19610,BLACK WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, I don’t think it’s fair to blame us- -
19611,WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back."
19612,BLACK WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, We don’t have the men.
19613,WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, We’ve got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.
19614,BLACK WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.
19615,LOTHAR,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps."
19616,BLACK WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.
19617,WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," If I want excuses, I’ll put her in charge. They’re laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to King’s Landing, they’re laughing at us."
19618,WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," I hear it in my sleep! I’m not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I’ll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back."
19619,LOTHAR,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," He’ll never yield, Father."
19620,WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," Oh, he’ll yield."
19621,WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," You’ll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark’s child in his whore mother’s belly, and you’ll show him the knife you used to open his niece’s throat. And you’ll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew."
19622,WALDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," Cheer up, Lord Edmure. You’re going home.INT. RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBERJAIME and CERSEI are sitting in chairs across the room from each other."
19623,JAIME,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, I’m being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can’t manage it on his own because he’s 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.
19624,CERSEI,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, BEtter you’re elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.
19625,JAIME,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, I’m not going to the Riverlands.
19626,CERSEI,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," What, then?"
19627,JAIME,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, I’m going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone’s ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I’ll take them to the sept and I’ll remove the High Sparrow’s head and every other sparrow head I can find.
19628,CERSEI,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, You can’t.
19629,JAIME,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, He has our son! He stole our son! He’s torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?
19630,CERSEI,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won’t leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it’s ours and because you can."
19631,JAIME,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, You’ll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.
19632,CERSEI,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They’ve made us both stronger, all of them."
19633,CERSEI,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we’re going to do to them.
19634,CERSEI,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, We’ve always been together. We’ll always be together. We’re the only two people in the world.
19635,MEERA,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Why did you help us?
19636,RIDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.
19637,MEERA,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, The Three-Eyed Raven’s dead.
19638,RIDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Now he lives again.
19639,RIDER,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," When I last saw you, you were a boy. A fearless boy. Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother."
19640,BRAN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Who are you?
19641,BRAN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
19642,BENJEN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walker’s magic from taking hold.
19643,BRAN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, How?
19644,BENJEN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.
19645,BRAN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.
19646,BENJEN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.
19647,BRAN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, I didn’t have time to learn. I can’t control anything.
19648,BENJEN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.
19649,BENJEN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Drink.
19650,BENJEN,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men. When he does, you will be there waiting for him. And you will be ready.EXT. ESSOS ARID LANDSDAENERYS and DAARIO are leading the Dothraki horde on horseback. DAARIO shouts in Dothraki and raises his hand, halting the horde. DAENERYS stares at the face of a mountain crag in the distance."
19651,DAARIO,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Everything all right?
19652,DAENERYS,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, How many days’ ride to Meereen?
19653,DAARIO,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, A week at best.
19654,DAENERYS,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
19655,DAARIO,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons- - 1,000 ships easily. Probably more."
19656,DAENERYS,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, And who has that many?
19657,DAARIO,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Nobody.
19658,DAENERYS,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Nobody yet.
19659,DAARIO,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?
19660,DAENERYS,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, I take what is mine.
19661,DAARIO,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, You weren’t made to sit on a chair in a palance.
19662,DAENERYS,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, What was I made for?
19663,DAARIO,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," You’re a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn."
19664,DAENERYS,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Wait here.
19665,DAARIO,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, I’m going after her. Wait for me here.
19666,DAENERYS,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,  Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.
19667,DAENERYS,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?
19668,DAENERYS,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
19669,DAENERYS,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1," Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?"
19670,DAENERYS,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Are you with me?
19671,DAENERYS,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1, Now and always?
19672,MAN,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_110, That’s it. Get it to the top.
19673,MAN #2,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_110, Steady. Steady.
19674,RAY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_110, Up she goes.
19675,RAY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_110," Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?"
19676,RAY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_110," Here you are, son."
19677,RAY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_110," Oh, gentlemen, please."
19678,RAY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_110, In all my days I’ve never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?
19679,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_110, Just one.
19680,RAY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_110, Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.
19681,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_110, He was a woman.
19682,RAY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
19683,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, I’m used to it.
19684,RAY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," When I found you, I thought you’d been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there."
19685,RAY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn’t. Now, I reckoned you’d die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn’t. What kept you going?"
19686,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, Hate.
19687,RAY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," No, there’s a reason you’re still here."
19688,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," Aye, there’s a reason. I’m a big fucker and I’m tough to kill."
19689,RAY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," No, a reason. Gods aren’t done with you yet."
19690,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," I’ve heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though."
19691,RAY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," Well, maybe he was right. I don’t know much about the gods."
19692,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, You’re in the wrong line of work.
19693,RAY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," Oh, there’s plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don’t. I don’t even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it’s the old gods. Or maybe it’s the Lord of Light. Or maybe they’re all the same fucking thing. I don’t know. What matters, I believe, is that there’s something greater than us. And whatever it is, it’s got plans for Sandor Clegane."
19694,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, You didn’t know me back in my time. You don’t know the things I’ve done.
19695,RAY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, I’ve heard stories.
19696,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, If the gods are real...why haven’t they punished me?
19697,RAY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, They have.
19698,HIGH SPARROW,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, Your Grace. What are we reading today?
19699,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12."
19700,HIGH SPARROW,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," Ah, “As water rounds the stones, smoothing- -”"
19701,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," “Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman’s love calm a man’s brute nature. A wife salves her husband’s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.”"
19702,HIGH SPARROW,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don’t have a drop of the Mother’s mercy in their blood and savages who can’t read at all who understand the Father’s wisdom."
19703,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me."
19704,HIGH SPARROW,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, They are hard to love.
19705,HIGH SPARROW,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we’d look like without our fine clothes. How’d we smell without perfume."
19706,HIGH SPARROW,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, Can I ask you about a personal matter?
19707,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, Of course.
19708,HIGH SPARROW,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven’t joined him in the marriage bed."
19709,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, No.
19710,HIGH SPARROW,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves."
19711,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, It’s just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.
19712,HIGH SPARROW,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," Congress does not require desire on the woman’s part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work."
19713,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.
19714,HIGH SPARROW,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you’ve made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.
19715,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1, My grandmother?
19716,HIGH SPARROW,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1," Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul."
19717,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1, Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
19718,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1, Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.
19719,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1," Oh, this is madness!"
19720,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1," You’re not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about..."
19721,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1, Grandmother.
19722,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1, ...until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
19723,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1," Grandmother, please."
19724,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1, What have they done to you?
19725,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1," You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith."
19726,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1, We marched for you.
19727,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1," The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn’t. They showed mercy."
19728,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1, And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
19729,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1," Loras’s only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He’ll have to renounce his name and title..."
19730,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1, Have you lost your mind?
19731,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1, ...and live his life as a penitent.
19732,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_112, He can begin again.
19733,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_112, As a mindless fanatic.
19734,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_112, As a free man.
19735,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_112, You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.
19736,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_112, I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.
19737,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_112," But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home."
19738,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_112, I will never leave you. Never.
19739,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_112, You must.
19740,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_112, Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.
19741,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_112, The Mother watches over us all.
19742,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_112," I’ll see you soon, my dear."
19743,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_112," Seven blessings to you, Grandmother."
19744,MARGAERY,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_112, Shall we pray?
19745,DIM DALBA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1," We said we’d fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn’t what we agreed to. These aren’t White Walkers. This isn’t an army of the dead. This isn’t our find."
19746,TORMUND,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1," If it weren’t for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King’s army. And I’d be a pile of charred bones just like Mance."
19747,DIM DALBA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1," Remember Mance’s camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what’s left of us. And if we lose this, we’re gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We’ll be the last of the free folk."
19748,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1," That’s what’ll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you’re here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they’ll come for you. You’re right. This isn’t your fight. You shouldn’t have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn’t be asking you. It’s not the deal we made. I need you with me if we’re gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you’re going to survive."
19749,TORMUND,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1," The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we’re cowards. And if that’s what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk."
19750,WUN WUN,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, Snow.
19751,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, Are you sure they’ll come?
19752,TORMUND,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1," We’re not clever like you southerners. When we say we’ll do something, we do it."
19753,CERSEI,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, I heard you were leaving King’s Landing.
19754,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, That is hardly your concern.
19755,CERSEI,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, Your grandson is still a prisoner. You’ll leave him rotting in a cell?
19756,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
19757,CERSEI,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, You’re right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
19758,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, Good.
19759,CERSEI,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
19760,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1," I wonder if you’re the worst person I’ve ever met. At a certain age, it’s hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I’ll never forget it."
19761,CERSEI,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It’s the only truth I know. We must defend them.
19762,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1," I’m leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you’re half as bright as you think you are, you’ll find your way out of here, too."
19763,CERSEI,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, Never. I’ll never leave my son.
19764,OLENNA,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1," What’ll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother’s gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You’re surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You’re going to kill them all by yourself? You’ve lost, Cersei. It’s the only joy I can find in all this misery."
19765,MAN,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, Pick the pace up. Keep going.
19766,MAN #2,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, Keep it moving!
19767,BRONN,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1," Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches."
19768,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, Someone certainly does.
19769,BRONN,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1," Oh, no. Not me. I’m just an upjumped sellsword."
19770,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, You’re an anointed knight. There’s quite a difference.
19771,BRONN,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1," Aye, knights don’t get paid."
19772,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
19773,BRONN,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, That’s like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
19774,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
19775,BRONN,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
19776,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, And you’ll get all three. A Lannister always- -
19777,BRONN,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1, Don’t say it. Don’t fucking say it.
19778,LOTHAR,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," Come out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we’ll hang him."
19779,LOTHAR,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, This is your last warning. Yield the castle.
19780,BLACK WALDER,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," You think I won’t do it, old man?"
19781,BLACK WALDER,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, I sliced your niece’s throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
19782,BRYNDEN,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," Go on, then. Cut his throat."
19783,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," Lothar, is it?"
19784,LOTHAR,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Ser Jaime. We didn’t know you were coming.
19785,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," ‘Cause you didn’t set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged."
19786,BRONN,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Good thing we’re friends or we’d be fucking you in the ass right now.
19787,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
19788,BLACK WALDER,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," Whoa, whoa."
19789,LOTHAR,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Walder.
19790,BLACK WALDER,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.
19791,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," Only a fool makes threats he’s not prepared to carry out. Now let’s say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I’d do?"
19792,BLACK WALDER,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, I don’t give a rat’s- -
19793,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, I’m here by the king’s command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you’d like to take his place.
19794,LOTHAR,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," Apologies, Ser Jaime."
19795,LOTHAR,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Do as he says.
19796,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he’ll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is."
19797,BRONN,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
19798,BLACK WALDER,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Those are our siege towers- -
19799,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," As I said, the siege is under my command. If that’s not to your liking, go home."
19800,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
19801,BRONN,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, A parley or a fight?
19802,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, He’s an old man.
19803,BRONN,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, You’ve got one hand. My money’s on the old boy.EXT. BEAR ISLANDThe castle of House Mormont sits atop a high hill. Waterfalls pour out below. A bird screeches.
19804,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, Lady Mormont.
19805,LYANNA,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, Welcome to Bear Island.
19806,SANSA,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I’m sure you will be, too."
19807,LYANNA,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," I doubt it. My mother wasn’t a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb."
19808,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -"
19809,LYANNA,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, I think we’ve had enough small talk. What are you here?
19810,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
19811,LYANNA,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”
19812,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I’ve come with my sister to ask for House Mormont’s allegiance."
19813,LYANNA,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," As far as I understand, you’re a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I’ve heard conflicting reports."
19814,SANSA,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark."
19815,LYANNA,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," If you say so. In any case, you don’t just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men."
19816,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -"
19817,LYANNA,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, I understand that I’m responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else’s war?
19818,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel."
19819,LYANNA,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," I don’t know you, Ser…?"
19820,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth."
19821,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, You needn’t ask your maester about my house. It’s rather new.
19822,LYANNA,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?"
19823,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," You never thought you’d find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I’d be in my position. I was a crabber’s son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I’m here because this isn’t someone else’s war. It’s our war."
19824,LYANNA,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," Go on, Ser Davos."
19825,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn’t between a few squabbling houses. It’s between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming."
19826,LYANNA,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, Is this true?
19827,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1, Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
19828,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won’t stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there’s no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together."
19829,LYANNA,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1," House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today."
19830,LYANNA,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, 62.
19831,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, 62?
19832,LYANNA,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114," We are not a large house, but we’re a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders."
19833,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114," If they’re half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed."
19834,BRYNDEN,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, Kingslayer.
19835,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, Blackfish.
19836,BRYNDEN,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, I assume you’re here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don’t see Sansa and Arya.
19837,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, I don’t have them.
19838,BRYNDEN,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?
19839,BRYNDEN,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, Then why are you here?
19840,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114," You know why I’m here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You’re trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -"
19841,BRYNDEN,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, Or you’ll kill Edmure?
19842,BRYNDEN,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, My nephew’s marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
19843,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, It won’t stop with Edmure. You’ll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
19844,BRYNDEN,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.
19845,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114," We’ll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I’ll spare the lives of your men. On my honor."
19846,BRYNDEN,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
19847,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114," The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?"
19848,BRYNDEN,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114," As long as I’m standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I’m ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?"
19849,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, You clearly have no intention of saving your men’s lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
19850,BRYNDEN,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114," Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you."
19851,JAIME,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114," Well, now you have."
19852,BRYNDEN,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114," Aye, now I have. I’m disappointed."
19853,ROBETT,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, The answer is no.
19854,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114," Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out."
19855,ROBETT,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, I’ve heard enough. We’ve only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.
19856,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
19857,ROBETT,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?
19858,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, House Mormont.
19859,ROBETT,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, And?
19860,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -
19861,ROBETT,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, I don’t care about ravens. You’re asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?
19862,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
19863,ROBETT,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, Then the rumors are true. I didn’t dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.
19864,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, Lord Glover.
19865,ROBETT,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, There’s nothing else to say.
19866,SANSA,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.
19867,ROBETT,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114," Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father’s death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb’s call and hailed him King in the North."
19868,ROBETT,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114, And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.
19869,ROBETT,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_114," I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead."
19870,THEON,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, Why did we have to come here?
19871,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.
19872,THEON,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, I don’t want one.
19873,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," Don’t go far, love."
19874,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, I’ll find you in a bit.
19875,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn’t interest you anymore?
19876,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," I’m sorry. I won’t joke about it. I’ll never hurt you, little brother. Don’t you know that?"
19877,THEON,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, You think Uncle Euron’s hunting for us?
19878,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," Of course he is. As long as we’re alive, we’re a threat."
19879,THEON,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, He’ll find us.
19880,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, It’s a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.
19881,THEON,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, I don’t want any.
19882,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, I don’t care what you want. Drink.
19883,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, Drink it all.
19884,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," You’re Ironborn, Theon. I know you’ve had some bad years."
19885,THEON,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, Some bad years?
19886,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, But I’m tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.
19887,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink."
19888,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you’re never going back. We’ll get justice for you."
19889,THEON,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell."
19890,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," Fuck justice, then. We’ll get revenge. Drink."
19891,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," Listen to me. If you’re so broken that there’s no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you’re staying, Theon, I need you. We’re gonna sail to Meereen. We’re gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we’re gonna take back the Iron Islands."
19892,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, Are you with me? Are you really with me?
19893,YARA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," Now, since it’s my last night ashore for a long while, I’m gonna go fuck the tits off this one."
19894,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
19895,SANSA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, And that’s a good thing?
19896,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There’s a stream down there for the horses.
19897,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, We’re not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
19898,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did."
19899,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
19900,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," 2,000 Wildlings. 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins- -"
19901,SANSA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, 62 Mormonts.
19902,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, It’s not what we’d hoped for. But we still have a chance if we’re careful and smart.
19903,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, For fuck’s sake.
19904,SANSA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, So he’s your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
19905,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, Ser Davos is the reason I’m standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
19906,SANSA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn’t have a head?"
19907,SANSA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, It’s not enough. We need more men.
19908,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, There’s no time.
19909,SANSA,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord- -"
19910,JON SNOW,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, We fight with the army we have.
19911,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," Friends, this is not worth fighting over!"
19912,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," This’ll be it, now. Right now, we don’t need to be fighting."
19913,MAN,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, Who the fuck are you?
19914,DAVOS,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1, Hold on.
19915,MAN #2,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1," Yeah, who the fuck are you?"
19916,RAY,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1," I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn’t. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That’s all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I’m your arsonist. Steal that farmer’s crops. Good, I’m your thief. Kill those young lads so they won’t take up arms against us. I’m your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren’t animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy’s throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back."
19917,RAY,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1," That night...I felt such shame. Shame was so heavy on me, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep."
19918,RAY,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1, All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son’s name. I’ll hear her screaming the rest of my life.
19919,RAY,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1," Now, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I’ve got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That’s all any of us can do, isn’t it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people."
19920,RAY,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1, It’s never too late to come back.
19921,RAY,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1, And it’s not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It’s not even about the gods. It’s about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.
19922,RAY,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1," Seven save you, friends. How can we help you?"
19923,LEM,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1, What are you doing here?
19924,RAY,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1," Well, we’re talking about life. You?"
19925,LEM,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1, Protecting the people.
19926,RAY,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1," Well, we thank you for your protection. Who are you protecting us from?"
19927,LEM,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1, Do you have any horses?
19928,RAY,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1, No horses. No gold. No steel.
19929,LEM,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1," Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work."
19930,RAY,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1," I’m sure it is. You’re welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here."
19931,LEM,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1, Stay safe. The night is dark and full of terrors.
19932,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1," “Seven save you, friends.”"
19933,RAY,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, I’m a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?
19934,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, They don’t believe in your Seven. They’re from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.
19935,RAY,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1," Aye, well, all are welcome here. Anyway, we got nothing for them."
19936,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1," Sure, you do. You’ve got food, you’ve got steel even if you say you don’t. And you’ve got women."
19937,RAY,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, What do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them?
19938,RAY,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1," It’d be you against all of them. I mean, these people don’t know how to fight."
19939,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, You do.
19940,RAY,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, I’m done with fighting.
19941,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, Even if it’s to protect yourself?
19942,RAY,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, Violence is a disease. You don’t cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
19943,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1," You don’t cure it by dying, either."
19944,RAY,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, You’ve done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.
19945,SANDOR,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, It’s gonna be a cold night. We’ll need firewood.
19946,RAY,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, I’ll save you a bowl of stew. Might even have some ale hidden away.EXT. BRAAVOS - MARKETPLACEPeople of all sorts line the streets. ARYA walks among them with her hands behind her back. She encounters two men sitting across from each other at a small table.
19947,MAN,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, He’s not a lying man. He says the Iron Fleet’s in Slaver’s Bay. I’m inclined to believe him. I’m not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.
19948,ARYA,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, You’re Westerosi.
19949,MAN,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, What do you care?
19950,ARYA,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, I want to book passage home.
19951,MAN,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, You? Can’t afford it.
19952,MAN,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, Where’d you steal this from?
19953,ARYA,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, Why do you care?
19954,MAN,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, We leave in two days. You can have a hammock in steerage.
19955,ARYA,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, I want a cabin. And we’ll leave at dawn.
19956,ARYA,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, See you at sunrise.
19957,WOMAN,6,57,the broken man,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS_1, Sweet girl.
19958,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,Unnamed Scene_115," My son. My firstborn son. My child king, hush. Listen to the gods, for you they sing. Fight no more, sweet child. Your wars are won. The wolves are buried and the false stag done. Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall. The Father above beckons you into his hall. In Seventh Heaven I’ll see you once more. But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear. With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon, or my life."
19959,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, You’re good at that. Where did you learn?
19960,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I’m a jealous woman. I’ve always liked bad men and they’ve always liked me. They’d come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore’s perfume.
19961,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," So we’d fight and I’d put a hole in them. And then I’d feel terrible, so I’d patch them up. I got good at patching them up."
19962,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, And good at putting holes in them.
19963,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, And that.
19964,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.
19965,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Bianca.
19966,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, She’ll have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face.
19967,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Mmm.
19968,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I never did learn to cook. But eat. Eat. You need it. The company is moving on to Pentos soon. You should come with us.
19969,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I can’t.
19970,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Why not? Got a feeling you’d be good at this sort of work. And besides, we need a new actress."
19971,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I don’t think I could remember all of the lines.
19972,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Come with us. What’s left for you here?
19973,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, You wouldn’t be safe. Not while she’s looking for me.
19974,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Who?
19975,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, She doesn’t have a name.
19976,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Where will you go?
19977,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what’s west of Westeros?
19978,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I don’t know.
19979,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Nobody does. That’s where all the maps stop.
19980,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," The edge of the world, maybe."
19981,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I’d like to see that.
19982,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, What’s that?
19983,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Milk of the poppy.
19984,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I don’t want any.
19985,LADY CRANE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Sleep is the only way you’ll heal. Trust me, if my soup didn’t kill you, nothing will."
19986,MAN,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty."
19987,GATINS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I was a famous kisser. You lads know how to kiss proper?
19988,YOUNG MAN,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Course we do.
19989,GATINS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," This is for masters, this technique. You’re not ready."
19990,YOUNG MAN #2,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I’m ready.
19991,MAN,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, He says he’s ready.
19992,GATINS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, All right.
19993,GATINS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Now, pay attention. You put your left hand on the back of the lady’s head."
19994,GATINS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Your right hand holds the small of the lady’s back like so.
19995,GATINS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Very romantic. Take your middle finger, yeah, and you jam it right up her bunghole."
19996,MAN,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, So fucking close!
19997,GATINS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Ah, it smells like pussy to me."
19998,MAN,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Look at him. You get hard, boy?"
19999,YOUNG MAN #2,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.
20000,YOUNG MAN #2,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?"
20001,SANDOR,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Where’s the other one? The one with the yellow cloak.
20002,GATINS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Fuck you!
20003,SANDOR,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Those are your last words, fuck you? Come on, you can do better."
20004,GATINS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Cunt!
20005,SANDOR,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," You’re shit at dying, you know that?"
20006,RED PRIESTESS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," From the fire she was reborn to remake the world. Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light to her children. If we are steadfast in our love for the Queen and her faithful advisors, no man will ever lock us in chains again."
20007,TYRION,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I’d call that a successful gambit.
20008,VARYS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Would you?
20009,TYRION,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Look around. The city has come back to life.
20010,VARYS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, You made a pact with fanatics.
20011,TYRION,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I did and it worked.
20012,VARYS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you’d say the razor worked. That doesn’t mean it won’t cut your throat."
20013,TYRION,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.
20014,TYRION,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I’m going to miss you.
20015,VARYS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I know.
20016,TYRION,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I hope you’re right about this expedition of yours.
20017,VARYS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," If I don’t return, you’ll know I was wrong."
20018,VARYS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1,We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.
20019,TYRION,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Most of all, we need our queen."
20020,VARYS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, She’ll come back. She has to. My heart’s been broken too many times already.
20021,VARYS,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I’ll walk the rest of the way myself. I can’t go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.
20022,TYRION,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Varys.
20023,TYRION,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, The most famous dwarf in the world.
20024,QYBURN,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep."
20025,CERSEI,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Have been permitted? That’s rather a tortured way of putting it.
20026,QYBURN,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," They demand to see you, Your Grace."
20027,CERSEI,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?
20028,CERSEI,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, The king is aware of their presence?
20029,QYBURN,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," He is, Your Grace. He’s currently in his chambers at prayer."
20030,LANCEL,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor."
20031,CERSEI,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
20032,LANCEL,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Your Grace, this is not a request."
20033,CERSEI,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I’m refusing."
20034,LANCEL,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, The High Septon commands you. Are you sure you want to refuse him?
20035,CERSEI,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
20036,LANCEL,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, He made no such promises. If you refuse to come of your own free will- -
20037,CERSEI,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Get out.
20038,LANCEL,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Move aside, ser."
20039,LANCEL,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.
20040,CERSEI,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, I choose violence.
20041,CERSEI,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Please tell His High Holiness he’s always welcome to visit.
20042,PODRICK,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," Looks like a siege, my lady."
20043,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1," You have a keen military mind, Pod."
20044,PODRICK,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, My lady. My lady.
20045,MAN,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, Who goes there? State your business!
20046,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT_1, My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I’ve come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.
20047,BRONN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren’t we?"
20048,BRONN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you’d be dead by now.
20049,PODRICK,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Not yet.
20050,BRONN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Are they in there?
20051,PODRICK,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Mm-hmm.
20052,BRONN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, You think they’re fucking?
20053,PODRICK,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, What? No.
20054,BRONN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," Why not? I’d fuck her. You’d fuck her, wouldn’t you?"
20055,PODRICK,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, I’m her squire.
20056,BRONN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," Oh. Well, he’d fuck her, that’s for sure. And she’s fuck him, don’t you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you’re the one with the magic cock."
20057,BRONN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, You must have shown it to her by now.
20058,PODRICK,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, She’s training me to fight.
20059,BRONN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Is she? Oh.
20060,PODRICK,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," An hour in the morning, and hour at night. Every day."
20061,BRONN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
20062,PODRICK,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," Well, that’s a different sort of fighting."
20063,BRONN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," Now, that’s the truth, isn’t it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?"
20064,BRONN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," All right, let’s start with your footwork."
20065,BRONN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1, Show me your stance.
20066,BRONN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?"
20067,BRONN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT_1," Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don’t sulk."
20068,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, I never thought you’d find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
20069,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, Why would you assume that?
20070,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1," In my experience, girls like her don’t live very long."
20071,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, I don’t think you know many girls like her.
20072,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1," Well, I’m proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds."
20073,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1," Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey’s murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?"
20074,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, I’ve come for the Blackfish.
20075,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, You’re welcome to have him.
20076,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
20077,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
20078,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, The Tully army.
20079,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1," They’re a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum."
20080,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, The Tullys are rebels because they’re fighting for their home?
20081,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
20082,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
20083,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, Exactly.
20084,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, We shouldn’t argue about politics.
20085,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1," You’re a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I’ve seen it myself."
20086,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, I’m a Lannister. Don’t ask me to betray my own house.
20087,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
20088,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, What do you propose?
20089,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
20090,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
20091,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, Because you’ll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
20092,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, Have you ever met the Blackfish?
20093,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, No.
20094,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, He’s even more stubborn than you are.
20095,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1," All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won’t listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else’s home."
20096,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1," I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you’ll grant us safe passage north."
20097,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, You have my word. You have until nightfall.
20098,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, You gave it to me for a purpose. I’ve achieved that purpose.
20099,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, It’s yours. It will always be yours.
20100,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1," one last thing, Ser Jaime."
20101,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1," Yes, Lady Brienne?"
20102,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1," Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa’s kin."
20103,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, Of course it does.
20104,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, To fight you.
20105,JAIME,6,58,no one,JAIME’S TENT_1, Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.
20106,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, I’ve said no three times already.
20107,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
20108,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, I haven’t seen her since she was a child. I don’t know her signature. I don’t know you. And I will not surrender.
20109,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Double the guards tonight.
20110,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," As I have said, my name is- -"
20111,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man."
20112,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, He always spoke highly of you.
20113,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," And if he were here now, I’d tell him the same I’m telling you."
20114,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," If you think I’m abandoning my family’s seat on the Kingslayer’s word of honor, you’re a bloody fool."
20115,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
20116,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.
20117,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, He’s not my friend.
20118,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, No?
20119,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
20120,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die."
20121,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, She’s exactly like her mother.
20122,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, I don’t have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
20123,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, You have more than she does.
20124,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," She wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does."
20125,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
20126,PODRICK,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, What should I write?
20127,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," Tell her I failed.INT. RED KEEP - THRONE ROOMA crowd of nobles fills the throne room. CERSEI enters, followed by QYBURN and GREGOR. The crowd stares at them and parts to let them pass. They approach the throne. TOMMEN, KEVAN, and MAESTER PYCELLE stand atop the steps to the throne. KEVAN walks down the steps and confronts CERSEI."
20128,CERSEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, There’s to be a royal announcement?
20129,KEVAN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, There is.
20130,CERSEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Why wasn’t I informed?
20131,KEVAN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.
20132,KEVAN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Where are you going?
20133,CERSEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, To stand by my son.
20134,KEVAN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.
20135,TOMMEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister’s trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother."
20136,TOMMEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all."
20137,CROWD,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Seven blessings.
20138,QYBURN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.
20139,CERSEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
20140,QYBURN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, More. Much more.INT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOMTYRION pours himself a glass of wine. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI sit across from him.
20141,MISSANDEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, You seem happy.
20142,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself."
20143,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Now it’s like a man reborn.
20144,MISSANDEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, I will be happy when our queen returns.
20145,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Why don’t you drink? Why don’t either of you ever drink?
20146,GREY WORM,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Unsullied never drink.
20147,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Why not?
20148,GREY WORM,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Rules.
20149,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, And who made these rules? Your former masters?
20150,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Those miserable old shits didn’t want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
20151,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, And you? What’s your excuse?
20152,MISSANDEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.
20153,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, That’s how you know it’s working.
20154,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Here’s to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
20155,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign."
20156,GREY WORM & MISSANDEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Long may she reign.
20157,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Do you like it?
20158,GREY WORM,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Tastes like it has turned.
20159,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I’d like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp’s Delight. Only my close friends could drink it."
20160,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath."
20161,MISSANDEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, I do not know any jokes.
20162,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Grey worm?
20163,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale..."
20164,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," ...but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”"
20165,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, It’s funnier in Westeros.
20166,GREY WORM,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies."
20167,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Yes.
20168,MISSANDEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily."
20169,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," A story that’s supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps."
20170,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," Missandei, do you like the wine?"
20171,MISSANDEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, I do.
20172,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Tell a joke.
20173,MISSANDEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, Two translators are on a sinking ship.
20174,MISSANDEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1," The first says, “Do you know how to swim?” The second says, “No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.”"
20175,GREY WORM,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, That is the worst joke I ever heard.
20176,MISSANDEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, You don’t even know what a joke is.
20177,GREY WORM,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?
20178,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, You lied to us.
20179,GREY WORM,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, I make joke.
20180,MISSANDEI,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, More jokes.
20181,TYRION,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_1, I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -
20182,MISSANDEI,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1," The Masters have come for their property.EXT. RIVERRUN - LANNISTER/FREY ENCAMPMENTJAIME rides horseback through the encampment, approaches a tent, dismounts, and enters."
20183,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, Lord Edmure.
20184,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you’ll be properly fed and clothes from now on.
20185,EDMURE,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, I have your word?
20186,EDMURE,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1," Oh, good. Good, that’s- - that’s a fine thing. My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser. Whatever game you’re playing."
20187,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1," The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I’ve heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You’re a potent man."
20188,EDMURE,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, A son I’ve never met born of a wife that I haven’t seen since our first night together.
20189,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1," You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he’ll have a keep of his own."
20190,EDMURE,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you’ve massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.
20191,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1," I’ll remind you that our houses are at war. I’m sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences."
20192,EDMURE,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, Says the man who shoved his sword through his king’s back.
20193,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It’s not.
20194,EDMURE,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, You understand. On some level you understand that you’re an evil man.
20195,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, I’ll leave the judgments to the gods.
20196,EDMURE,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1," Well, that is convenient for you. You’re a fine-looking fellow, aren’t you?"
20197,EDMURE,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1," Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we’re decent, don’t we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you’re decent after everything that you’ve done?"
20198,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, I was your sister’s prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
20199,EDMURE,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, Yeah. She should have killed you.
20200,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1," Perhaps, but she didn’t. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn’t hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son."
20201,EDMURE,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don’t?
20202,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1," No, I don’t, but I’m telling you anyway because you’re my prisoner. You don’t have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister."
20203,EDMURE,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1," Oh. Oh, I see. You’re a madman."
20204,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, I’m not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -
20205,EDMURE,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, Don’t talk about Cat!
20206,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, I’ll talk about whomever I want.
20207,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1," She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there’s a fierceness you don’t often see."
20208,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, They’d do anything to protect their babies.
20209,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
20210,EDMURE,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1, You didn’t come here to talk about our sisters.
20211,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1," That’s exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn’t matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I’ll send for your baby boy."
20212,JAIME,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE_1," And I’ll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don’t matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn’t matter to me. The people in the castle don’t matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that’s what I’ll do."
20213,GUARD CAPTAIN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, Who goes there?
20214,EDMURE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3," Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully, and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. I demand entry."
20215,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, Don’t let him in.
20216,GUARD CAPTAIN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, He’s the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.
20217,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3," He’s been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because it’s a trap, you idiot. Don’t let him in."
20218,GUARD CAPTAIN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3," He’s my lord, my lord. I’ve sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands."
20219,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, You’re not obeying Edmure’s commands. You’re obeying the fucking Kinglsayer’s commands.
20220,EDMURE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, I demand entry.
20221,GUARD CAPTAIN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, My lord has given an order.
20222,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, WIth a knife to his throat. That is not a valid order.
20223,GUARD CAPTAIN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed- -
20224,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, I’ll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.
20225,GUARD CAPTAIN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3," You are not lord of this castle, my lord."
20226,GUARD CAPTAIN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, Lower the drawbridge!
20227,GUARD,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3," Aye, ser!"
20228,BLACK WALDER,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3," If you’re wrong, we’re just surrendered our most valuable prisoner."
20229,GUARD CAPTAIN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3," Welcome home, my lord."
20230,EDMURE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms. Open the gates.
20231,GUARD CAPTAIN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, My lord- -
20232,EDMURE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, Your lord has given a command.
20233,EDMURE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, Find the Blackfish. Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.
20234,GUARD CAPTAIN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_3, Find him.
20235,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - RIVER EXIT_1, Go on.
20236,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - RIVER EXIT_1, Come with us.
20237,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - RIVER EXIT_1, I’ve run before from the Red Wedding. I’m not running again. This is my family home.
20238,BRIENNE,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - RIVER EXIT_1, Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don’t die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
20239,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - RIVER EXIT_1, You’ll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.
20240,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - RIVER EXIT_1," Go on, now."
20241,BRYNDEN,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - RIVER EXIT_1, I haven’t had a proper sword fight in years. I expect I’ll make a damn fool of myself.
20242,GUARD,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_5," We found the Blackfish, my lord."
20243,JAIME,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_5, Good. Bring him to me.
20244,GUARD,6,58,no one,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL_5," He died fighting, my lord."
20245,TYRION,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, I was wrong. I admit it.
20246,MISSANDEI,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, That changes nothing.
20247,TYRION,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers’ forces- -
20248,GREY WORM,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.
20249,TYRION,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, And I have acknowledged that. I’m trying- -
20250,GREY WORM,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, You’re trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.
20251,TYRION,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1," All right, what should the army do?"
20252,GREY WORM,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1," We’ll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here."
20253,TYRION,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, And then?
20254,GREY WORM,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them.
20255,BERIC,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, Clegane.
20256,THOROS,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, What the fuck you doing here?
20257,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, Chasing them. You?
20258,THOROS,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, Hanging them.
20259,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, Any particular reason?
20260,BERIC,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, They’re our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
20261,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.
20262,THOROS,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, You’ve got friends?
20263,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, Not anymore. They’re mine.
20264,BERIC,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, It’s the Brotherhood’s good name they’ve dragged through the dirt.
20265,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1," Fuck your name. They’re mine. I killed you once before, Dondarrion. Happy to do it again."
20266,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1," Drop that arrow, you bloody girl."
20267,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.
20268,BERIC,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, You can have one of them.
20269,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, Two.
20270,THOROS,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1," No, no, no."
20271,THOROS,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, We’re not butchers. We hang them.
20272,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, hanging? All over in an instant. Where’s the punishment in that?
20273,THOROS,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, They die.
20274,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, We all bloody die.
20275,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, Except this one here. I’ll only gut one of them.
20276,BERIC,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, No.
20277,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, I’ll chop off one hand.
20278,BERIC,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That’s generous.
20279,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, Bunch of nancies.
20280,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
20281,THOROS,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1," You’re getting old, Clegane."
20282,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, He’s not.
20283,LEM,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, Please don’t. I’ll give you anything.
20284,SANDOR,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1, Got anything to eat?
20285,THOROS,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, Enjoying yourself?
20286,SANDOR,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, I prefer chicken.
20287,BERIC,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, You ought to join us. We could use you.
20288,SANDOR,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, I tried joining. Didn’t work out for me.
20289,THOROS,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1," Clegane, we’re here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves."
20290,SANDOR,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.
20291,BERIC,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, Cold winds are rising in the North.
20292,SANDOR,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, And you’re going to go stop them?
20293,BERIC,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, We need good men to help us.
20294,SANDOR,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1," Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me."
20295,BERIC,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?
20296,SANDOR,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1," I beat you because I’m better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I’m better than you now."
20297,BERIC,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1," Aye, you’re probably right. You’re a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we’re fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you’ve harmed Clegane, it’s not too late for you.INT. BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENTARYA is sleeping. LADY CRANE enters the bedroom, sits down beside ARYA, and strokes her face. ARYA stirs and groans. LADY CRANE stands and walks back into the abutting room. She retrieves a stool and stands atop it, reaching for a bottle on top of a bureau. She turns around and sees a young man with blonde hair. Cut to ARYA’s perspective. There is a thud. ARYA awakens with a gasp and looks around. She sees a shadow moving in the abutting room."
20298,ARYA,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, Lady Crane?
20299,ARYA,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, Lady Crane?
20300,WAIF,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1," If you’d have done your job, she would have died painlessly."
20301,WAIF,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, Instead…
20302,WAIF,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, The Many-Faced God was promised a name. He must always receive what is his. You can’t change that. I can’t change that. No one can. And now he’s been promised another name.
20303,WAIF,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?
20304,WAIF,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1, Haven’t we been through this already? That won’t help you.
20305,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, You told her to kill me.
20306,JAQEN,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Yes. But here you are. And there she is.
20307,JAQEN,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, Finally a girl is no one.
20308,ARYA,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1, A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I’m going home.
20309,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_116," Despite appearances, I think you’ll find the city’s on the rise."
20310,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_116, Perhaps we should take shelter.
20311,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_116, The city is on the rise?
20312,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_116, Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
20313,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_116," Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…"
20314,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_116, ...it proves that no one needs a Master.
20315,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_116, Good. Shall we begin?
20316,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_116, Do we have a plan?
20317,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_116," I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan."
20318,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_116, You don’t approve?
20319,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_116, You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King’s Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
20320,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_116," Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That’s why Jaime killed him."
20321,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_116, This is entirely different.
20322,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_116, You’re talking about destroying cities. It’s not entirely different. I’d like to suggest an alternate approach.
20323,RAZDAL,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_1," Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver’s Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are."
20324,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_1," We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults."
20325,YEZZAN,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_1, The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
20326,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_1," We obviously didn’t communicate clearly. We’re here to discuss your surrender, not mine."
20327,RAZDAL,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_1, I imagine it’s difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.
20328,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_1, My reign has just begun.
20329,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - HARBOR_1, Dracarys.
20330,GREY WORM,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3, You men have a choice
20331,GREY WORM,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3," ...fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families."
20332,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3," Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven."
20333,MISSANDEI,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3, Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
20334,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3," It always seems a bit abstract, doesn’t it, other people dying?"
20335,RAZDAL,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3, Him. He should die.
20336,BELICHO,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3," Yes, him."
20337,RAZDAL,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3," He’s not one of us. He’s an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us."
20338,YEZZAN,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3, Please.
20339,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3," Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen."
20340,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3, You don’t have to be here.
20341,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3," Yes, I do."
20342,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3, My beloved wife. I’ve missed you terribly.
20343,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3," Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night’s Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don’t have the men, you don’t have the horses, and you don’t have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There’s no need for a battle. Get off your horse and kneel. I’m a man of mercy."
20344,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3, You’re right. There’s no need for a battle. Thousands of men don’t need to die. Only one of us. Let’s end this the old way. You against me.
20345,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3," I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you’re the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don’t know if I’d beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?"
20346,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3," Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn’t fight for them?"
20347,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3," He’s good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you’re too proud to surrender?"
20348,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3, How do we know you have him?
20349,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3," Now, if you want to save —"
20350,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3," You’re going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well."
20351,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3," She’s a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you’re all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven’t fed them for seven days. They’re ravenous. I wonder which parts they’ll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We’ll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard."
20352,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," If he was smart, he’d stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
20353,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," That’s not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they’ll stop fearing him. He can’t have that. Fear is his power."
20354,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," It’s his weakness, too. His mean don’t want to fight for him. They’re forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning..."
20355,TORMUND,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, It’s not his men that worry me. It’s his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.
20356,TORMUND,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
20357,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," We’re digging trenches all along our flanks. They won’t be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment."
20358,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, A pincer move.
20359,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, They won’t be able to hit us from the sides.
20360,TORMUND,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, Good.
20361,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," It’s crucial that we let them charge at us. They’ve got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he’ll pursue. Then we’ll have him surrounded on three sides."
20362,TORMUND,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?
20363,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
20364,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, We should all get some sleep.
20365,TORMUND,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow."
20366,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," So you’ve met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans."
20367,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," Aye, for what they’re worth."
20368,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," You’ve known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don’t know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?"
20369,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, You’re right.
20370,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, You think he’s going to fall into your trap. He won’t He’s the one who lays traps.
20371,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, He’s overconfident.
20372,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, He plays with people. He’s far better at it than you. He’s been doing it all his life.
20373,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I’ve defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton."
20374,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, You don’t know him.
20375,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?"
20376,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," We’ll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay’s claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won’t live long."
20377,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, We can’t give up on our brother.
20378,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake."
20379,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, Of course he does. What should I do differently?
20380,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, I don’t know! I don’t know anything about battles! Just don’t do what he wants you to do.
20381,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," Aye, that’s good advice."
20382,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, You think that’s obvious?
20383,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," Well, it is a bit obvious."
20384,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?"
20385,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, When will we have a larger force?! We’ve pleaded with every house that’ll have us! The Blackfish can’t help us! We’re lucky to have this many men!
20386,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, It’s not enough!
20387,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," Now, it’s not enough! It’s what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds."
20388,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1," If Ramsay wins, I’m not going back there alive. Do you understand me?"
20389,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1, No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.
20390,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, You think there’s hope?
20391,TORMUND,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1," I’ve never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they’ve never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there’s hope. You want to avenge your king, don’t you?"
20392,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, It wasn’t the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
20393,TORMUND,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, You saw these demons?
20394,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, What?
20395,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1," No, it’s a manner of speaking. Not actual demons."
20396,TORMUND,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1," Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn’t have demons in his skull. He didn’t torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you."
20397,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1," Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings."
20398,TORMUND,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, Jon Snow’s not a king.
20399,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1," No, he’s not."
20400,TORMUND,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat’s milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
20401,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1," No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle."
20402,TORMUND,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, So what do you do all night?
20403,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I’m far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
20404,TORMUND,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1, Happy shitting.
20405,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1, My lady. You weren’t at the war council.
20406,MELISANDRE,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1, I’m not a soldier.
20407,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1, Any advice?
20408,MELISANDRE,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1, Don’t lose.
20409,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1," If I do, if I fall, don’t bring me back."
20410,MELISANDRE,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1, I’ll have to try.
20411,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1, I’m ordering you not to bring me back.
20412,MELISANDRE,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1," I am not your servant, Jon Snow."
20413,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1, You’re in my camp. I’m the commander.
20414,MELISANDRE,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1, I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.
20415,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1, How do you know what he commands?
20416,MELISANDRE,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1," I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn’t want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you."
20417,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1, Why?
20418,MELISANDRE,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1, I don’t know. Maybe you’re only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
20419,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1, What kind of god would do something like that?
20420,MELISANDRE,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1, The one we’ve got.
20421,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1," Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf’s height thinks he’s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf’s height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You’re all making the same five or six jokes."
20422,THEON,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, It was a long time ago.
20423,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1," It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can’t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well."
20424,THEON,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, I didn’t murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
20425,YARA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, And he paid for them.
20426,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1," Doesn’t seem like it. He’s still alive. It was complicated for you, I’m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don’t we?"
20427,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1," You’ve brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?"
20428,THEON,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Not my claim. Hers.
20429,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, And what’s wrong with you?
20430,THEON,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, I’m not fit to rule.
20431,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, We can agree upon that at least.
20432,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
20433,YARA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, No more than Westeros.
20434,THEON,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.
20435,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
20436,YARA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, You and I have that in common.
20437,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.
20438,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Will their ships be enough?
20439,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1," With the former Masters’ fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet."
20440,THEON,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, There are and Euron is building more. He’s going to offer them to you.
20441,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, So why shouldn’t I wait for him?
20442,THEON,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, The Iron Fleet isn’t all he’s bringing. He also wants to give you --
20443,YARA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1," His big cock, I think he said. Euron’s offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won’t get one without the other."
20444,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
20445,YARA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1," I never demand, but I’m up for anything, really."
20446,THEON,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He’ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
20447,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, The Seven Kingdoms.
20448,THEON,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, All of them.
20449,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, And you don’t want the Seven Kingdoms?
20450,THEON,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
20451,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, And that’s all?
20452,YARA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, We’d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don’t think a woman’s fit to rule.
20453,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Reasonable.
20454,TYRION,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
20455,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1," She’s not demanding, she’s asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We’re not going to do that. We’re going to leave the world better than we found it."
20456,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1," You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping."
20457,YARA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, That’s our way of life.
20458,DAENERYS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, No more.
20459,YARA,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, No more.
20460,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1," Do you like games, little man? Let’s play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him. That’s it. That’s the game. Easy. Ready? Go."
20461,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1," No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules."
20462,TORMUND,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Don’t.
20463,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!
20464,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Go! Go! Follow your commander!

20467,KARSTARK,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1," Cavalry, charge!"
20468,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, We’ll just kill our own men. Stand down.
20469,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Loose!
20470,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Get word --
20471,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, We may as well be taking shits back here.
20472,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Follow!
20473,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1," It’s time, go."
20474,SMALLJON,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Who owns the North?
20475,ALL,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, We do!
20476,SMALLJON,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Who owns the North?
20477,ALL,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, We do!
20478,SMALLJON,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1, Show me!
20479,MAN,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_118," Infantry, advance!"
20480,DAVOS,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_118," With me, lads! Break their line!"
20481,MAN,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_118, Tormund!
20482,MAN #2,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_118, Get him back!
20483,TORMUND,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_118," Fuck this, come on!"
20484,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1, Their army’s gone.
20485,MAN,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1, Our army’s gone.
20486,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1, We have Winterfell. They don’t have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.
20487,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1," You suggested one on one combat, didn’t you?"
20488,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1, I’ve reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.
20489,JON SNOW,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1, We’re going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.
20490,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1, Jon.
20491,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1, Where is he?
20492,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - KENNELS_1," Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I’ll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That’s all right. You can’t kill me. I’m part of you now."
20493,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - KENNELS_1, Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.
20494,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - KENNELS_1, My hounds will never harm me.
20495,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - KENNELS_1, You haven’t fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.
20496,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - KENNELS_1, They’re loyal beasts.
20497,SANSA,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - KENNELS_1, They were. Now they’re starving.
20498,RAMSAY,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - KENNELS_1, Sit. Down! Down! Down! Down! Down!
20499,ATTENDANT,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’s CHAMBER_1, Your Grace. The trial will be getting underway soon.
20500,MISTRESS,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - MAESTER PYCELLE’S CHAMBER_1, You got my money?
20501,PYCELLE,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - MAESTER PYCELLE’S CHAMBER_1, Later. Go away.
20502,GIRL,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - MAESTER PYCELLE’S CHAMBER_1, Grand Maester.
20503,HIGH SPARROW,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5, Ser Loras Tyrell. Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?
20504,LORAS,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5, There’ll be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.
20505,HIGH SPARROW,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5, To which crimes will you be confessing?
20506,LORAS,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5, All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.
20507,LORAS,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5," I perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity… dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just."
20508,HIGH SPARROW,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5," The gods’ judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her."
20509,LORAS,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5, I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.
20510,HIGH SPARROW,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5, You understand fully what this means?
20511,LORAS,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5, I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.
20512,HIGH SPARROW,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5, Brother Loras…
20513,HIGH SPARROW,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5, ...I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.
20514,HIGH SPARROW,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5, Will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates?
20515,LORAS,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5, I will.
20516,MACE,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5," No, I can’t let them…"
20517,MARGAERY,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5," Faith is the way, Father."
20518,TOMMEN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_9, All right. I’m ready.
20519,TOMMEN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_9," I have to go, I’m-- I’m late for the trial."
20520,MARGAERY,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_7, You mutilated him. You gave me your word.
20521,HIGH SPARROW,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_7," I’ve kept my word. Once the queen mother’s trial is concluded, Brother Loras is free to leave."
20522,MARGAERY,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_7, And where is the queen mother?
20523,LANCEL,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_7, Her litter never left the Red Keep.
20524,HIGH SPARROW,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_7, It appears the queen mother doesn’t wish to attend her own trial.
20525,HIGH SPARROW,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_9, Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.
20526,LANCEL,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_3, Get the others.
20527,PYCELLE,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB_3, Where’s the king?
20528,QYBURN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB_3," Elsewhere, I’m afraid."
20529,PYCELLE,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB_3, What’s the meaning of this? I was told that-- I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence--
20530,QYBURN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB_3," Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will. Please forgive me if you can."
20531,QYBURN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB_7," This pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest."
20532,LANCEL,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS_7," The longer you wait, the worse it’ll be for you."
20533,LANCEL,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS_7, What are you doing?
20534,MARGAERY,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_15, There’s something wrong.
20535,HIGH SPARROW,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_15," You have nothing to fear, Your Grace. The trial will begin shortly."
20536,MARGAERY,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_15, Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here. Why do you think they are not here?
20537,HIGH SPARROW,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_15," If the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless. We cannot escape the justice of the gods--"
20538,MARGAERY,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_15," Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I’m telling you. Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences. The trial can wait. We all need to leave."
20539,MARGAERY,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_17, We all need to leave now!
20540,MARGAERY,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_17, Loras. Stay with me.
20541,MARGAERY,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_19, Let me through. Let me through. Get out of my way.
20542,MARGAERY,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_19, Let us through!
20543,CERSEI,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1, Confess. Confess.
20544,SEPTA UNELLA,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1, No.
20545,CERSEI,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1, Confess.
20546,CERSEI,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1," Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn’t do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances."
20547,CERSEI,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1, You’ve always been quiet.
20548,CERSEI,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1, I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?
20549,SEPTA UNELLA,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1, Good. I’m glad to see your face. I’m ready to meet the gods.
20550,CERSEI,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1, What? Now? Today? You’re not going to die today. You’re not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.
20551,CERSEI,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1," This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He’s quiet, too."
20552,CERSEI,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1, Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.
20553,SEPTA UNELLA,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1, No.
20554,CERSEI,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1, Shame.
20555,CERSEI,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1, Shame.
20556,CERSEI,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1, Shame.
20557,ATTENDANT,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13," I’m very sorry, Your Grace. Very sorry."
20558,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, For House Lannister!
20559,MEN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, Hear me roar!
20560,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, For House Frey!
20561,MEN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, We stand together!
20562,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13," May we stand together through the centuries, good friends to the last."
20563,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13," And when we drive our swords through our enemies’ hearts, may we speak the words of our alliance, “The Freys and the Lannisters send their regards.”"
20564,BRONN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13," You don’t even have to do anything, do you?"
20565,BRONN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13," You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking."
20566,JAIME,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, You’re welcome to her.
20567,BRONN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, She doesn’t want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.
20568,JAIME,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, Those two have their eyes on you.
20569,BRONN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13," They have their eyes on you, cunt."
20570,JAIME,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, Not my type.
20571,BRONN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, Not blonde enough?
20572,JAIME,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13," Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
20573,JAIME,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, There you go.
20574,BRONN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, Maybe I’m not in the mood.
20575,BRONN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, Fuck it.
20576,BRONN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, No need to call me ser just because I’m an anointed knight.
20577,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, This came together rather well. Your father would be pleased.
20578,JAIME,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, I’m sure he would be.
20579,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, Edmure is back in a cell. Can’t go killing my son by law. It wouldn’t be right. Give the family a bad name.
20580,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13," So the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers, eh? Legendary warrior, everyone said."
20581,JAIME,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13," Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?"
20582,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13, I’m a bit old for all that.
20583,JAIME,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13," No, but back in your day."
20584,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_120, I’ve defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it’s mine. What do you call that? Victory.
20585,JAIME,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_120," Yes, you’re a great conqueror."
20586,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_120," Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if you’re an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. But it doesn’t matter. Here we are now, two kingslayers. We know what it’s like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs. We don’t mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing."
20587,JAIME,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_120," They don’t fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?"
20588,CERSEI,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_120, Show me.
20589,QYBURN,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_120," Your Grace, there’s no need--"
20590,CERSEI,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_120, Show me.
20591,QYBURN,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_120," What are your thoughts concerning the king’s funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?"
20592,CERSEI,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_120," He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.EXT. OLDTOWN - OUTSKIRTSA horse-drawn carriage moves down the road, then stops. SAM and GILLY emerge from behind it. GILLY is carrying LITTLE SAM. They walk to a nearby hill look out over a lake. Oldtown stands across the lake. SAM and GILLY marvel at it."
20593,SAM,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1, Hello.
20594,SAM,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1, From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.
20595,SAM,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1, I’m-- I’m to be the new maester.
20596,MAESTER,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1, Oh.
20597,MAESTER,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1," According to our records, Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander."
20598,SAM,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1, He died.
20599,MAESTER,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1, We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.
20600,SAM,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1, Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He’s since passed away. Which is why I’m here.
20601,MAESTER,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1, This is irregular.
20602,SAM,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1," Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular."
20603,MAESTER,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1," The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you. In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library. Follow me."
20604,MAESTER,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1,  No women or children!
20605,JON SNOW,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3," When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I’d sit down there."
20606,MELISANDRE,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3," Could have been worse, Jon Snow. You had a family. You had feasts."
20607,JON SNOW,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3," Aye, you’re right. I was luckier than most."
20608,JON SNOW,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, What is that?
20609,DAVOS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.
20610,MELISANDRE,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, The Princess Shireen.
20611,DAVOS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!
20612,MELISANDRE,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, We burned her at the stake.
20613,DAVOS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, Why?
20614,MELISANDRE,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.
20615,DAVOS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, You burned a little girl alive!
20616,MELISANDRE,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, I only do what my Lord commands!
20617,DAVOS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3," If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!"
20618,MELISANDRE,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
20619,DAVOS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
20620,MELISANDRE,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.
20621,DAVOS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3," The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied."
20622,MELISANDRE,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, I didn’t lie. I was wrong.
20623,DAVOS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3," Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?"
20624,DAVOS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.
20625,JON SNOW,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3, Do you have anything to say for yourself?
20626,MELISANDRE,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3," I’ve been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he’s not. You’ve seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war."
20627,JON SNOW,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3," Ride south today. If you return to the North, I’ll have you hanged as a murderer."
20628,DAVOS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3," If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself."
20629,JON SNOW,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, I’m having the lord’s chamber prepared for you.
20630,SANSA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, Mother and Father’s room? You should take it.
20631,JON SNOW,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, I’m not a Stark.
20632,SANSA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, You are to me.
20633,JON SNOW,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, You’re the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We’re standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
20634,SANSA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, He did.
20635,JON SNOW,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, And you trust him?
20636,SANSA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I’m sorry."
20637,JON SNOW,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, We need to trust each other. We can’t fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.
20638,SANSA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, Jon.
20639,SANSA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.
20640,JON SNOW,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," Well, Father always promised, didn’t he?"
20641,OLENNA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?"
20642,ELLARIA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna."
20643,OLENNA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?"
20644,OBARA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?
20645,OLENNA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, What is your name again? Barbaro?
20646,OBARA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, Obara.
20647,OLENNA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don’t presume to tell me what I need.
20648,NYMERIA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes--"
20649,OLENNA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," Do shut up, dear."
20650,OLENNA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, Anything from you?
20651,OLENNA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
20652,ELLARIA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
20653,OLENNA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I’m after now.
20654,ELLARIA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, You’re absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart’s desire.
20655,OLENNA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, And what is my heart’s desire?
20656,ELLARIA,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, Vengeance. Justice.
20657,VARYS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," Fire and blood.INT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOMDAENERYS is sitting on a couch, sipping a glass of wine. DAARIO enters."
20658,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, Your ships are nearly ready. I saw them painting the sails.
20659,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, I’m curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.
20660,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, You’re not coming with us.
20661,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King’s Landing."
20662,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, You’re not going to Westeros. You’re staying here with the Second Sons. There’s finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
20663,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I’m here for you, not them."
20664,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I’m going to rule in Westeros, I’ll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage."
20665,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, Who are you marrying this time?
20666,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, I don’t know. Maybe no one.
20667,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?
20668,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, I can’t bring a lover to Westeros.
20669,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, A king wouldn’t think twice about it.
20670,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, So that’s what you want? To be my mistress?
20671,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, I’m not proud. I don’t care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don’t want a crown. I want you.
20672,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.
20673,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, I can’t.
20674,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, The dwarf told you to do this.
20675,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, No one tells me to do anything.
20676,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, Clever fellow. Can’t argue with his logic. I’m no use to you over there.
20677,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, Don’t get angry.
20678,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," I’m not angry. I’m full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?"
20679,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons."
20680,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, Bay of Dragons?
20681,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," We can’t call it Slaver’s Bay anymore, can we?"
20682,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," You’ll get that throne you want so badly, I’m sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness."
20683,DAARIO,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1, I pity the lord of Westeros. They have no idea what’s coming for them.
20684,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1," Farewell, Daario Naharis."
20685,TYRION,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, How did he take it?
20686,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, No tears.
20687,TYRION,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That’s the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it’s any consolation."
20688,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, It’s not.
20689,TYRION,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," No, I suppose not. I’m terrible at consoling."
20690,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," Yes, you really are."
20691,TYRION,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you’ve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It’s all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?"
20692,TYRION,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, Good. You’re in the great game now. And the great game’s terrifying. The only people who aren’t afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
20693,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.
20694,TYRION,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, He wasn’t the first to love you and he won’t be the last.
20695,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," Well, you have completely failed to console me."
20696,TYRION,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," For what it’s worth, I’ve been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone’s always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am."
20697,TYRION,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," I believe in you. It’s embarrassing, really. I’d swear you my sword, but I don’t actually own a sword."
20698,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, It’s your counsel I need.
20699,TYRION,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, It’s yours. Now and always.
20700,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I’m not sure if it’s right."
20701,DAENERYS,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen."
20702,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," You’re not one of mine, are you?"
20703,HANDMAIDEN,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," No, my lord."
20704,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, Didn’t think so. Too pretty.
20705,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, Where are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.
20706,HANDMAIDEN,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," They’re here, my lord."
20707,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now."
20708,HANDMAIDEN,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," But they’re already here, my lord."
20709,HANDMAIDEN,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," Here, my lord."
20710,HANDMAIDEN,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, They weren’t easy to carve. Especially Black Walder.
20711,WALDER,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, What…
20712,ARYA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you’re ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.
20713,PETYR,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," Forgive me, my lady… if you’re at prayer."
20714,SANSA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," I’m done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had."
20715,SANSA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, I was a stupid girl.
20716,PETYR,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, You were a child.
20717,SANSA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, What do you want?
20718,PETYR,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, I thought you knew what I wanted.
20719,SANSA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, I was wrong.
20720,PETYR,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," No, you weren’t. Every time I’m faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne… and you by my side."
20721,SANSA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, It’s a pretty picture.
20722,PETYR,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. I’ve declared for House Stark for all to hear.
20723,SANSA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," You’ve declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It’s never stopped you from serving yourself."
20724,PETYR,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You, my love, are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?"
20725,BENJEN,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, This is where I leave you.
20726,MEERA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, You’re not coming with us?
20727,BENJEN,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," The Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass."
20728,MEERA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, Where will you go?
20729,BENJEN,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, The great war is coming and I still fight for the living. I’ll do what I can… as long as I can.
20730,BRAN,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," Thank you, Uncle Benjen."
20731,BENJEN,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, I wish you both good fortune.
20732,MEERA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, Are you sure you’re ready for this?
20733,BRAN,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,I’m the Three-Eyed Raven now. I have to be ready for this.
20734,LYANNA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, Ned?
20735,NED,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, Lyanna.
20736,LYANNA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, Is that you? Is that really you?
20737,LYANNA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, You’re not a dream.
20738,NED,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," No, I’m not a dream. I’m here. Right here."
20739,LYANNA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," I’ve missed you, big brother."
20740,NED,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," I’ve missed you, too."
20741,LYANNA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, I want to be brave.
20742,NED,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, Shh. You are.
20743,LYANNA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, I’m not.
20744,LYANNA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, I don’t want to die.
20745,NED,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, You’re not going to die.
20746,NED,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, Get her some water!
20747,LYANNA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," No, no water."
20748,NED,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, Is there a maester?
20749,LYANNA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," Please. Listen to me, Ned."
20750,LYANNA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," If Robert finds out, he’ll kill him, you know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me."
20751,LYANNA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," Promise me, Ned. Promise me."
20752,VALE KNIGHT,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, You can’t expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders.
20753,TORMUND,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, We didn’t invade. We were invited.
20754,VALE KNIGHT,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, Not by me.
20755,JON SNOW,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield."
20756,MAN,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," The Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right, it’ll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms."
20757,JON SNOW,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won’t wait out the storm. He brings the storm."
20758,LYANNA,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly. But you refused the call. You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refuse the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don’t care if he’s a bastard. Ned Stark’s blood runs through his veins. He’s my king from this day until his last day."
20759,MANDERLY,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly. My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. I didn’t think we’d find another king in my lifetime. I didn’t commit my men to your cause ‘cause I didn’t want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. The King in the North."
20760,GLOVER,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.
20761,JON SNOW,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1," There’s nothing to forgive, my lord."
20762,GLOVER,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, There will be more fights to come. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years. And I will stand behind Jon Snow… the King in the North!
20763,GLOVER,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, The King in the North!
20764,ALL,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
20765,JAIME,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1, Come on.
20766,QYBURN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_3," I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms."
20767,QYBURN,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_3, Long may she reign.
20768,ALL,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_3," Long may she reign.EXT. SUMMER SEATHEON and YARA are standing on their ship. They look out at the sea. A vessel appears with a dragon as its ram. GREY WORM and the Unsullied are riding in it. Hundreds of other ships are sailing around them. Some of the ships carry the Dothraki and their horses. DROGON, VISERION, and RHAEGAL fly overhead. They fly over the boat leading the convoy DAENERYS, TYRION, VARYS, and MISSANDEI are riding in it. DAENERYS and TYRION look at each other, then DAENERYS looks out at the ocean ahead. The dragons screech.CREDITS2Embed"
20769,WALDER FREY,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_121," You're wonder why I brought you all here. After all, we just had a feast. Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?"
20770,WALDER FREY,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_121," Well, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say!"
20771,WALDER FREY,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_121," I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come. But first, a toast! No more of that Dornish horse piss! This is the finest Arbor gold! Proper wine for proper heroes!"
20772,WALDERY FREY,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_121, Stand together!
20773,ALL,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_121, Stand together!
20774,WALDER,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_121, Not you. I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.
20775,WALDER,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_121," Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot. You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding."
20776,WALDER,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_121," Yes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home. But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks."
20777,WALDER,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_121," No, no, that was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out, root and stem."
20778,WALDER,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_121, Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.
20779,ARYA,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_121," When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey."
20780,EDD,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, You wildlings?
20781,MEERA,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1," I'm Meera Reed, daughter of Howland Reed. This is Brandon Stark, son of Ned Stark."
20782,EDD,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, How do I know that's true?
20783,BRAN,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, You were at the Fist of the First Men. You were at Hardhome. You've seen the Army of the Dead. You've seen the Night King. He's coming for us. For all of us.
20784,EDD,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1," Okay, come on. Let's get them inside."
20785,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1," I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow."
20786,ROBETT,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.
20787,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, Not just the boys.
20788,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.
20789,ROBETT,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?
20790,LYANNA,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1," I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you."
20791,ROBETT,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1," Indeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned--"
20792,LYANNA,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, And I don't need your permission to defend the North.
20793,LYANNA,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1," We'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island."
20794,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1," While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk."
20795,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, But if we're going to survive this winter together...
20796,TORMUND,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, You want us to man the castles for you?
20797,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
20798,TORMUND,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, Then that's where I'll go. Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.
20799,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1," If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold."
20800,YOHN,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North. Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.
20801,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1," The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay."
20802,ALL,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, Aye!
20803,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.
20804,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, And then they broke faith.
20805,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.
20806,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?
20807,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
20808,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.
20809,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1," When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final."
20810,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, Ned Umber.
20811,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, Alys Karstark.
20812,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1," For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon."
20813,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, Stand.
20814,JON,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1," Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?"
20815,NED & ALYS,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1, Now and always!
20816,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," You are my sister, but I am king now."
20817,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Will you start wearing a crown?
20818,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
20819,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, So I can't question your decisions anymore?
20820,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," Of course you can, but--"
20821,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?
20822,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Do you think I'm Joffrey?
20823,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
20824,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Thank you.
20825,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," You're good at this, you know."
20826,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, At what?
20827,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, At ruling.
20828,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, No.
20829,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--"
20830,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Why are you laughing?
20831,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit."
20832,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, He never said that to me.
20833,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls."
20834,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying."
20835,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me."
20836,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, I'm not trying to undermine you.
20837,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it."
20838,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
20839,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Would that be so terrible?
20840,WOLKAN,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace."
20841,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," ""Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"""
20842,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, What does she want?
20843,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
20844,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south."
20845,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too."
20846,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
20847,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
20848,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder."
20849,JON,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, You almost sound as if you admire her.
20850,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," I learned a great deal from her.EXT. KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP COURTYARDCERSEI walks atop a mural of Westeros painted on the floor. The painter is completing it. JAIME enters and walks towards CERSEI, then looks at the mural and nods at the painter. The painter puts down his brush and exits."
20851,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, What is this?
20852,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not."
20853,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain."
20854,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," It's ours now, we just have to take it."
20855,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
20856,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," No, not angry."
20857,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Are you afraid of me?
20858,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Should I be?
20859,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?"
20860,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Dragonstone.
20861,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born."
20862,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Enemies to the east.
20863,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.
20864,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor."
20865,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
20866,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock."
20867,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
20868,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side."
20869,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
20870,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in."
20871,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
20872,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.
20873,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," A dynasty for us, then."
20874,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, We never talked about Tommen.
20875,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, There's nothing to say.
20876,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Our baby boy killed himself.
20877,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?"
20878,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Cersei--
20879,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count."
20880,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
20881,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
20882,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1," We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone."
20883,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1, You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
20884,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1, The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
20885,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1, Not all of them.
20886,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1," Well, it looks like all of them."
20887,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1," I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are."
20888,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1, How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
20889,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1," So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing."
20890,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1," They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves."
20891,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1, Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
20892,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1," Oh, what did he come here for, then?"
20893,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1, A queen.
20894,EURON,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1," The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you."
20895,EURON,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1," It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together."
20896,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1," You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?"
20897,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1," The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."
20898,EURON,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1," I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance."
20899,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1, The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
20900,EURON,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1, The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.
20901,JAIME,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1, And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
20902,EURON,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1," A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas."
20903,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1, If not the most humble.
20904,EURON,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1," You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south."
20905,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1, What do you want in return?
20906,EURON,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1," Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands."
20907,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1, I decline your proposal.
20908,EURON,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1, Why?
20909,CERSEI,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1, You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
20910,EURON,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1, You should try it. Feels wonderful.
20911,EURON,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1," I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you."
20912,MARWYN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1," Ah, Maester Weyland. A drinker's liver if ever I saw one."
20913,MARWYN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1, Weigh that.
20914,MARWYN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1, The triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankind's curse.
20915,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1," Archmaester, I was wondering..."
20916,MARWYN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1, What's the weight?
20917,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1," Um, 147."
20918,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1, I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
20919,MARWYN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1, I don't remember your proposition.
20920,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1," I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library."
20921,MARWYN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1, That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?
20922,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1, No.
20923,MARWYN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1," Not a very strong proposition, is it?"
20924,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1," Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
20925,MARWYN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1, Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
20926,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1, Sources in the restricted area?
20927,MARWYN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1, The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
20928,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1," So, you believe me."
20929,MARWYN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1, I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?
20930,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1, That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
20931,MARWYN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1," We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this world's memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--""The end is near! How will we survive?"" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended."
20932,MARWYN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1, Be a good lad. Clean this up.
20933,BRIENNE,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, Nope.
20934,BRIENNE,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, Nope.
20935,TORMUND,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, You're a lucky man.
20936,PETYR,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11,  I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat. She's a very impressive woman.
20937,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," What do you want, Lord Baelish?"
20938,PETYR,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.
20939,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me."
20940,PETYR,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, What about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?
20941,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," At the moment, peace and quiet."
20942,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever."
20943,PETYR,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, My lady.
20944,PETYR,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, My lady.
20945,BRIENNE,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, Why is he still here?
20946,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us."
20947,BRIENNE,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, He wants something.
20948,SANSA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, I know exactly what he wants.EXT. RIVERLANDS - FORESTARYA is riding a horse through the forest. She happens upon a group of Lannister soldiers sitting by a fire.
20949,MAN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are--
20950,ARYA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.
20951,MAN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, It's a new one.
20952,MAN #2,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.
20953,ARYA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, I don't want to steal your food.
20954,MAN #3,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," You're not stealing, we're offering. Come on, it's gonna be a cold night."
20955,MAN #3,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, You heading south?
20956,ARYA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, King's Landing.
20957,MAN #2,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, Poor girl.
20958,ARYA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," Not so bad, is it?"
20959,MAN #3,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," Depends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you."
20960,MAN #2,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin."
20961,MAN #3,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," The people who live there, they'd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide."
20962,MAN,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, Worst place in the world.
20963,ARYA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, What are you doing in the Riverlands?
20964,MAN #3,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," There's been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace."
20965,MAN #2,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, Here you go. Guests first.
20966,ARYA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough."
20967,MAN #2,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, My mother always told me to be kind to strangers. Strangers will be kind to you.
20968,ARYA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though."
20969,MAN #2,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," Yeah, endless adventures. They'll be singing about us for a thousand years."
20970,MAN #2,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone. I ought o be out there with him.
20971,MAN #3,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, My wife's just had our first baby.
20972,ARYA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, Boy or girl?
20973,MAN #3,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," Oh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?"
20974,MAN #3,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, I hope it's a girl.
20975,ARYA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, Why?
20976,MAN #3,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.
20977,MAN #2,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, Are you old enough to drink?
20978,MAN #2,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, It's blackberry wine. I made it myself.
20979,ARYA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, It's really good.
20980,MAN #3,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11," So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?"
20981,ARYA,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11, I'm going to kill the queen.
20982,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARM_1, Bad night to be outdoors.
20983,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARM_1," You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? ""It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night."""
20984,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARM_1," You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum?"
20985,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARM_1, Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.
20986,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARM_1, Why are you always in such a foul mood?
20987,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARM_1, Experience.
20988,BERIC,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARM_1, This seems like a good place to spend the night.
20989,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARM_1, These people don't want us here.
20990,BERIC,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARM_1, Seems deserted to me. No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney.
20991,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARM_1, I don't like the look of it.
20992,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARM_1," For a big, hard man, you scare easy."
20993,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARM_1, I'll tell you what doesn't scare me
20994,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARM_1, Come on. Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.
20995,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARM_1, They don't.
20996,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, See if there's a larder. They always leave something behind.
20997,BERIC,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, How do you think it ended for them?
20998,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, With death.
20999,BERIC,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1," Girl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them."
21000,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, Doesn't matter now.
21001,BERIC,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1," No, doesn't matter now."
21002,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1," I've known you a long time, Dondarrion."
21003,BERIC,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--
21004,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, And I always thought you were dull as dirt.
21005,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1," You're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like, but you're not bad."
21006,BERIC,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1," Thank you, Clegane. That warms the heart."
21007,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, But there's nothing special about you.
21008,BERIC,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, You're right about that.
21009,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1," So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?"
21010,BERIC,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
21011,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, And?
21012,BERIC,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, I don't know. I don't understand our Lord.
21013,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, Your Lord.
21014,BERIC,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.
21015,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1," If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?"
21016,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, Clegane.
21017,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, Come over here. Don't worry. The fire won't bite. I want to show you something.
21018,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.
21019,BERIC,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.
21020,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1," There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead...and that girl would be alive."
21021,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, What do you want?
21022,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, Look into the flames.
21023,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, I don't want to look in the damn flames.
21024,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?
21025,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.
21026,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, We can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you.
21027,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, What do you see?
21028,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, Logs burning.
21029,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, Keep looking. What do you see?
21030,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.
21031,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, What else?
21032,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.
21033,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past.
21034,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1, Thousands of them.
21035,BERIC,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1," Do you believe me now, Clegane? Do you believe we're here for a reason?"
21036,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)_1," What the hell are you doing, Clegane?"
21037,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)_1, Burying the dead.
21038,THOROS,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)_1, You knew these people.
21039,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)_1, Not really.
21040,SANDOR,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)_1," We ask the Father to judge us with mercy. We ask the Mother to... Fuck it, I don't remember the rest. I'm sorry you're dead. You deserved better. Both of you."
21041,LITTLE SAM,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)_1, Mom.
21042,GILLY,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)_1," You should really sleep, Sam."
21043,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)_1, The dead don't.
21044,GILLY,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)_1," ""Legends of the Long Night."""
21045,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)_1, The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
21046,GILLY,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)_1, What is it?
21047,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)_1, It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
21048,GILLY,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)_1, That's dragonglass?
21049,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT)_1," A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know."
21050,JORAH,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL QUARANTINE CELLS_1, Has she come yet?
21051,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL QUARANTINE CELLS_1, Who?
21052,JORAH,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL QUARANTINE CELLS_1, The Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.
21053,SAM,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL QUARANTINE CELLS_1, Haven't heard anything.
21054,DAENERYS,7,61,dragonstone,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1, Shall we begin?CREDITS3Embed
21055,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," On a night like this, you came into the world."
21056,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
21057,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, I wish I could remember it.
21058,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
21059,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
21060,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, Good.
21061,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, Not so many lions.
21062,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now..."
21063,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?
21064,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them."
21065,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already."
21066,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
21067,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, No.
21068,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south."
21069,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, I never properly thanked you for that.
21070,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you."
21071,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?"
21072,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, I did.
21073,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, And then you served the man who overthrew him?
21074,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe."
21075,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
21076,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king."
21077,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
21078,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--"
21079,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?"
21080,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful."
21081,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
21082,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, Which you turned to your advantage.
21083,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, Who gave the order to kill me?
21084,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, King Robert.
21085,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, Who hired the assassins?
21086,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
21087,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--"
21088,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, To keep yourself alive.
21089,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
21090,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?"
21091,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you."
21092,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them."
21093,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," I swear it, my queen."
21094,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive."
21095,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122, I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
21096,GREY WORM,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_122," Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you."
21097,MELISANDRE,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"  Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded.  It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains."
21098,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen.  You are very welcome here.  What is your name?
21099,MELISANDRE,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  I am called Melisandre.
21100,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"  She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.  It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?"
21101,MELISANDRE,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"  No, it didn't."
21102,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
21103,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.
21104,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"  The Lord of Light doesn't have  many followers in Westeros, does he?"
21105,MELISDANDRE,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  Not yet.   But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
21106,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  What does your Lord expect from me?
21107,MELISANDRE,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  The Long Night is coming.  Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.
21108,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  The prince who was promised will bring the dawn.  I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
21109,MISSANDEI,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"  Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate.  That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."
21110,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"  Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
21111,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"  No, but I like it better."
21112,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
21113,MELISANDRE,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"  Prophecies are dangerous things.  I believe you have a role to play, as does another.  The King in the North, Jon Snow."
21114,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  Jon Snow?  Ned Stark's bastard?
21115,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  You know him?
21116,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
21117,VARYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"  And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?"
21118,MELISANDRE,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger.  As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
21119,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  He sounds like quite a man.
21120,MELISANDRE,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"  Summon Jon Snow.  Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes."
21121,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"  I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character."
21122,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"  If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally.  The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother.  Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do."
21123,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,  Very well.  Send a raven north.  Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
21124,SANSA,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,  Do you think it's really Tyrion?  It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
21125,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,  Read the last bit.
21126,SANSA,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"  ""All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes.""  What does that mean?"
21127,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,  It's something he said to me the first night we met.  You know him better than any of us.  What do you think?
21128,SANSA,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"  Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters.  He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk.  ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.  Join us.  Together we can end her tyranny."""
21129,DAVOS,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"  Sounds like a charmer.  Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming."
21130,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,  What?
21131,DAVOS,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"  Fire kills Whites, you told me.  What breathes fire?"
21132,SANSA,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,  You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
21133,DAVOS,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"  No, too dangerous."
21134,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,  But?
21135,DAVOS,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"  But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?"
21136,CERSEI,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"  If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it.  Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.  But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown.  With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores.  Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts.  Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought.  This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty."
21137,CERSEI,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"  You all remember the Mad King.  You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.  His daughter is no different.  In Essos her brutality is already legendary.  She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.  And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons."
21138,CERSEI,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"  It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords.  We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her."
21139,RANDYLL,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"  She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace.  The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms.  How do you propose to stop them?"
21140,QYBURN,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"  We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord."
21141,JAIME,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,  Lord Tarley.
21142,RANDYLL,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"  Ser, Jaime.  I believe you know my son."
21143,DICKON,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"  Ser, Jaime."
21144,JAIME,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"  Rickon, isn't it?"
21145,DICKON,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,  Dickon.
21146,JAIME,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,  That's it.
21147,JAIME,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,  Thank you for coming.  The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever.  They might not have come if you hadn't.
21148,RANDYLL,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"  If my queen summons me, I answer the call.  And I've heard what she does to those that defy her."
21149,JAIME,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,  Do you ride for Hornhill today?
21150,RANDYLL,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,  I have an army to mobilize.  It won't be long until the fighting starts.
21151,JAIME,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,  And what side will you be fighting for?  You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.  Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
21152,RANDYLL,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"  It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime.  How may I serve?"
21153,JAIME,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,  I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.  I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies.  All of her enemies.
21154,RANDYLL,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,  Including Olenna Tyrell?  I'm a Tarley.  That name means something.  We're not oath breakers.  We're not schemers.  We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings.   I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
21155,JAIME,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"  You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."
21156,RANDYLL,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,  I've known Olenna since I was a child.
21157,JAIME,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"  She was a great woman, once.  Now she's broken.  She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores.  The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.  I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice.  Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?"
21158,JAIME,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,  When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south.  I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
21159,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  The infection has spread too far.  You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
21160,JORAH,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  How long?
21161,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"  It will be years before it kills you.  It could be 10, could be 20."
21162,JORAH,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  But how long 'till...
21163,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"  Your mind?  Six months, maybe fewer."
21164,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1," Pardon, Archmaester.  I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black.  She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured.  Isn't there some way --"
21165,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  Does this look like a baby to you?
21166,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  No.
21167,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
21168,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  No.
21169,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
21170,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"  This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser.  Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men.  As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day.  How you choose to spend that time is up to you."
21171,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"  Come, Samwell."
21172,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"  Should we send word to your family, Ser..."
21173,JORAH,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  Jorah.  Jorah Mormont.
21174,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  Mormont?
21175,JORAH,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  There's no need.  I've been dead to them for years.
21176,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"  Come, Samwell."
21177,QYBURN,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?"
21178,CERSEI,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  No, I can't say I have.  I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room."
21179,QYBURN,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
21180,CERSEI,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  They were his trophies.  He couldn't keep them around.  They would have made him look small.  Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.  I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
21181,QYBURN,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  Balerion the Dread.  The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.  Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.  Powerful, but not invincible."
21182,QYBURN,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.  If they can be wounded, they can be killed."
21183,QYBURN,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace.  If you'd kindly pull that lever."
21184,YARA,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  If you want the Iron Throne, take it.  We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons.  We should hit King's Landing now.  Hard.  With everything we have.  The city will fall within a day."
21185,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms."
21186,ELLARIA,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  It's called war.  You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding."
21187,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,    I know how you wage war.  We don't poison little girls here.  Myrcella was innocent.
21188,ELLARIA,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  She was a Lannister.  There are no innocent Lannisters.  My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
21189,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  That's enough.  Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen.  You will treat him with respect.
21190,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
21191,OLENNA,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  That's very nice to hear.  Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter.  The common people loved her, the nobles loved her.  And what is left of her now?  Ashes.  Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really.  They won't obey you unless they fear you."
21192,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council.  I'm grateful to all of you.  But you have chosen to follow me.  I will not attack King's Landing.  We will not attack King's Landing."
21193,OLEANNA,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?  By asking nicely?
21194,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides.  Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
21195,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
21196,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country.  If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.  Our army should be Westerosi."
21197,ELLIA,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
21198,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  You are.
21199,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
21200,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army.  Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
21201,OLENNA,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  So, your master plan is to use our armies?  Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?"
21202,TYRION,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  The unsullied will have another objective.  For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.  And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.  Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
21203,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  Do I have your support?
21204,YARA,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  You have mine.
21205,ELLIA,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  Dorne is with you, Your Grace."
21206,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  Thank you all.  Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?"
21207,DAENERYS,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.  But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
21208,OLENNA,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  Peace.  Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his?  Peace never lasts, my dear.  Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?"
21209,OLENNA,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  He's a clever man, your Hand.  I've known a great many clever men.  I've outlived them all.  Do you know why?  I ignored them.  The lords of Westeros are sheep.  Are you a sheep?  No.  You're a dragon.  Be a dragon."
21210,GREY WORM,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,   Enter.
21211,MISSANDEI,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  You leave tomorrow.  Were you going to say goodbye?
21212,GREY WORM,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  I will see you when I return.
21213,MISSANDEI,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  But you don't know when that will be.
21214,GREYWORM,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  No one knows.
21215,MISSANDEI,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  I wish you good fortune.
21216,GREY WORM,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  Missandei --
21217,GREY WORM,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
21218,MISSANDEI,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  Why?
21219,GREY WORM,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  You know why.
21220,MISSANDEI,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  I don't.
21221,GREY WORM,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  You are my weakness.
21222,MISSANDEI,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  That's what I am?  Your weakness?
21223,GREY WORM,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears.  One boy is scared of dogs.  One boy hates high places.  One is frightened of the ocean.  They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff.  They throw him in the water.  If he learns to swim, good.  If he drowns, good.  Either way, strong Unsullied.  But I had no fears.  I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always."
21224,MISSANDEI,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  I believe it.
21225,GREY WORM,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth.  Now I have fear.
21226,MISSANDEI,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  I do too.
21227,GREY WORM,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  No.
21228,MISSANDEI,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  I want to see you.  Please.
21229,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  It might be useful.  Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.
21230,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  Archmaester, I wanted to --"
21231,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  And this one.
21232,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  Maester Faol was quite the opposite.  A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
21233,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  I wanted to ask you --
21234,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research.  If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style.  I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread."
21235,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1, What?  You don't like the title?  What would you call it then?
21236,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  Possibly something a bit more poetic?
21237,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  We're not poets, Tarley."
21238,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  Archmaester, if I could just have a moment."
21239,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  This is your moment.  Use it wisely.
21240,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.  There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured.  I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.
21241,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.
21242,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"  Oh, you are?"
21243,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  Yes.  Should I tell you how he died?  From Greyscale.
21244,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  Oh.
21245,MARWYN,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,  The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.
21246,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  Hello.
21247,JORAH,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  What are you doing?
21248,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  You're Jorah Mormont.  You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.
21249,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"  My name is Samwell Tarley.  I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black.  I knew your father.  I was with him when he died.  You're not dying today, Ser Jorah."
21250,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  Drink this.
21251,JORAH,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  What is it?
21252,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"  Rum.  Drink it all, please.  I'm afraid this is going to hurt."
21253,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  If you could take off your shirt.
21254,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"  If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.  I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here.  If they hear you screaming then we're both finished."
21255,JORAH,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,  Have you ever done this before?
21256,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"  No.  No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got.  Have a seat.  I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --"
21257,SAMWELL,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"  Shh,  shhh.  Again, I'm sorry.  Please try not to scream."
21258,MAN #1,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons.
21259,MAN #2,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  Horse shit.  Cersei is just trying to frighten us.
21260,MAN #1,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,"  If it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple."
21261,MAN #2,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  As long as we get back there before they start.
21262,MAN #1,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  One more round.  It's a long ride.
21263,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  Ary!
21264,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,"  Hello, Hot Pie.  Sit down.  Who's that for?"
21265,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  Mmm.  This is good.
21266,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,    You think so?  The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.  Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
21267,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  I didn't do that.
21268,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  You've been making pies?
21269,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  One or two.
21270,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  I can't believe you're here.  Did you meet the big lady?
21271,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  Big lady?
21272,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  The lady knight.  I figured she was a knight because she had armor on.  She was looking for your sister but I told her about you.  Did she ever find you?
21273,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  She found me.
21274,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  What happened to you Ary?
21275,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  You got any ale?
21276,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  Where are you heading?
21277,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  King's Landing.
21278,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  Why?
21279,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  I heard Cersei's queen now.
21280,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  I heard she blew up the Great Sept.  That must have been something to see.  Boom.
21281,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  Hmm.
21282,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  I can't believe someone could do that.
21283,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  Cersei would do that.
21284,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
21285,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  Why would I go there?  The Boltons have it.
21286,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  No.  The Boltons are dead.
21287,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  What?
21288,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards.  He's King in the North now.
21289,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  You're lying.
21290,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  Why would I lie about that?  He's your brother right?
21291,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  Thanks for the pie.
21292,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  Friends don't pay.  I can't believe I thought you were a boy.  You're pretty.
21293,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,  Thanks.
21294,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,"  Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.  Try not to get killed."
21295,HOT PIE,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,"  No, I won't.  I'm like you, Ary.  I'm a survivor."
21296,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - KING'S QUARTERS_1,  Come in.
21297,WOLKAN,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - KING'S QUARTERS_1,"  A raven, My King, from the Citadel."
21298,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,  This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley.  He was my brother at the Night's Watch.  A man I trust as much as anyone in this world.  He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
21299,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,  I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone.  It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
21300,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"  He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.  She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.  She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons."
21301,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,  Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
21302,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"  We need this Dragonglass, My Lords.  We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army.  We need to mine it and turn it into weapons."
21303,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"  But more importantly, we need allies.  The Night King's army grows larger by the day.  We can't defeat them on our own.  We don't have the numbers.  Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire.  I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.  Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
21304,SANSA,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,  Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?  The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
21305,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,  I know that.
21306,SANSA,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"  She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.  The north is one of those seven kingdoms.  This isn't an invitation, it's a trap."
21307,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"  It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that.  You know him.  He's a good man."
21308,YOHN ROYCE,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"  Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa.  I remember the Mad King all too well.  A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister."
21309,ROBETT GLOVER,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"  We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom."
21310,LYANNA MORMONT,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"  Winter is here, Your Grace.  We need the King in the North in the north."
21311,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"  You all crowned me your king.  I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home.  It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds.  But the odds are against us.  None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.  None of you.  We can never hope to defeat them alone.  We need allies, powerful allies.  I know it's a risk.  But I have to take it."
21312,SANSA,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,  Then send an emissary.  Don't go yourself.
21313,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,  Daenerys is a queen.  Only a king can convince her to help us.  It has to be me.
21314,SANSA,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,  You're abandoning your people.  Your abandoning your home.
21315,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,  I'm leaving both in good hands.
21316,SANSA,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,  Whose?
21317,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"  Yours.  You are my sister.  You are the only Stark in Winterfell.  Until I return, the north is yours."
21318,BAELISH,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT_1,  I delivered his bones myself.  I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.  It seems like a lifetime ago.  Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
21319,BAELISH,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT_1,"  I was sorry when he died.  Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much.  So did I.  She wasn't fond of you, was she?  Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.  Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North.  Last best hope against the coming storm."
21320,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT_1,  You don't belong down here.
21321,BAELISH,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT_1,  Forgive me.  We have never talked properly.  I wanted to remedy that.
21322,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT_1,  I have nothing to say to you.
21323,BAELISH,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT_1,"  Not even thank you?  If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield.  You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them.  I love Sansa as I loved her mother."
21324,JON,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT_1,  Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
21325,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,RIVERLANDS_9,  Nymeria?
21326,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,RIVERLANDS_9,"  Nymeria, it's me, Arya.  I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell.  I'm finally going home.  Come with me."
21327,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,RIVERLANDS_9,  Come with me.
21328,ARYA,7,62,stormborn,RIVERLANDS_9,  That's not you.
21329,NYMERIA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,  You can't have them all.  It's not fair.
21330,OBARA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,  I'm oldest.
21331,TYENE,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,  Momma will want Cersei for herself.
21332,OBARA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,  She's not my momma.  You can have Cersei.  I want The Mountain.
21333,NYMERIA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,  The Mountain killed father.  He'll crush you with one hand.
21334,TYENE,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1, Father got careless.  That's what Momma says.
21335,OBARA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,"  Will you shut up about Momma?  Momma, momma."
21336,TYENE,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,  Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.
21337,ELLARIA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"  How can you drink this piss?  When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world.  Have you ever been to Dorne?"
21338,YARA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  A few times.  Never stayed long.
21339,ELLARIA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,   A boy in every port?
21340,YARA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"  A boy, a girl.  Depends on the port."
21341,ELLARIA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  Could we get some more?
21342,YARA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  I thought it wasn't for you.
21343,ELLARIA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  I'm developing a taste for it.
21344,YARA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  He's not your servant.
21345,THEON,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  It's fine.
21346,ELLARIA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"  So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands."
21347,YARA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  Once I kill my uncle.
21348,ELLARIA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"  And what will you be, handsome?"
21349,THEON,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  Whatever my queen demands.
21350,YARA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"  He'll be my advisor, my protector."
21351,ELLARIA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"  Oh, I see.  Your protector."
21352,ELLARIA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  So if someone gets too close to you --
21353,YARA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  He might have to intervene.
21354,ELLARIA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  -- hold that person back.
21355,YARA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  Until they've made their intentions known.
21356,ELLARIA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  Why are you standing all the way over there then?  A foreign invasion is under way.  It seems like you don't need a protector.
21357,YARA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  Stay here.
21358,YARA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP_1,  Euron.
21359,YARA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP_1,  Your mother is below deck.  Keep her safe.
21360,ELLARIA,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_5,  Kill us!  Get it over with!
21361,EURON,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP_7,  Give your uncle a kiss.
21362,EURON,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP_7,  Theon!
21363,EURON,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP_7,"  Ah, come on your cockless hound.  I have her.  Come and get her."
21364,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,  The bastard of Winterfell.
21365,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,  The dwarf of Casterly Rock.
21366,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,  I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.
21367,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,"  You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right.  You picked up some scars along the road."
21368,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,  It's been a long road.  But we're both still here.
21369,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,  I'm Tyrion Lannister.
21370,DAVOS,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,  Davos Seaworth.
21371,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,"  Ah, the Onion Knight.  We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
21372,DAVOS,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,  Unluckily for me.
21373,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,  Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.
21374,MISSANDEI,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,  Welcome to Dragonstone.  Our queen knows this is a long journey.  She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf.  If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.
21375,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,  Of course.
21376,MISSANDEI,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,"  Please, this way."
21377,DAVOS,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,  Where are you from?  I can't place the accent.
21378,MISSANDEI,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,  I was born on the Island of Naarth.
21379,DAVOS,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,  Ah.  I hear it's beautiful down there.  Palm trees and butterflies.  I haven't been myself.
21380,DAVOS,7,63,the queen's justice,Unnamed Scene_123,  This place has changed.
21381,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"  And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well."
21382,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  She is.
21383,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  Does she miss me terribly?
21384,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  A sham marriage and unconsummated.
21385,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  I didn't ask --
21386,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"  Well, it was.  It wasn't.  Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on."
21387,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  She's starting to let on.
21388,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  Good.  At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
21389,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
21390,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"  A long and bloody tale.  To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
21391,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
21392,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"  Of course they do.  If I was your hand I would have advised against it.  General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south."
21393,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  True.  But I'm not a Stark.
21394,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"  I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do."
21395,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  Come.  Their mother is waiting for you.
21396,VARYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests.  You begged us to summon the King in the North.  Don't you want to see him again?
21397,MELISANDRE,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  I've done my part.  I've brought ice and fire together.
21398,VARYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  Strange.  You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff.  I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
21399,MELISANDRE,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.
21400,VARYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"  Oh, I doubt that.  Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man.  Nothing is ever so sweet again."
21401,MELISANDRE,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"  Neither of us is common folk anymore.  I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor."
21402,VARYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  Why?
21403,MELISANDRE,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  Because of mistakes I made.  Terrible mistakes.  I would only be a distraction if I stayed.
21404,VARYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  So where will you go?
21405,MELISANDRE,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  Volantis.
21406,VARYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"  Good.  If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros.  I'm not sure you'd be safe here."
21407,MELISANDRE,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"  I will return, dear spider.  One last time."
21408,VARYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,  My Lady --
21409,MELISANDRE,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"  I have to die in this strange country, just like you."
21410,MISSANDEI,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains."
21411,DAVOS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  This is Jon Snow.
21412,DAVOS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  He's King in the North.
21413,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords.  I hope the seas weren't too rough."
21414,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  The winds were kind, Your Grace."
21415,DAVOS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  Apologies.  I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know.  But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace.  He's not a lord."
21416,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  Forgive me --
21417,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."
21418,DAERNEYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  Forgive me, Ser Davos.  I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen.  Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity.  But do I have my facts wrong?"
21419,DAVOS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  I wasn't there, Your Grace."
21420,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  No.  Of course not.  But still, an oath is an oath.  In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?"
21421,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  Forever.
21422,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  Forever.  So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee."
21423,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  I am not.
21424,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  Oh.  Well, that is unfortunate.  You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?"
21425,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  Break faith?  Your father burned my grandfather alive.  He burned my uncle alive.  He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
21426,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  My father was an evil man.  On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family.  And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father.  Our two houses were allies for centuries.  Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known.  Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.  I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.  Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.  Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.  Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
21427,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  You're right.  You're not guilty of your father's crime.  And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
21428,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  Then why are you here?
21429,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  Because I need your help and you need mine.
21430,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
21431,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  I did.
21432,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?"
21433,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  They're hard to miss.
21434,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  But still, I need your help?"
21435,DAVOS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  Not to defeat Cersei.  You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.  Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."
21436,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  Almost.
21437,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  But you haven't stormed King's Landing.  Why not?  The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.  It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it.  Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
21438,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
21439,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair."
21440,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  You told me you liked this man.
21441,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  I do.
21442,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child."
21443,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  I believe he's calling all of us children.  Figure of speech.
21444,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north."
21445,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north."
21446,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  I am not your enemy.  The dead are the enemy.
21447,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  The dead?
21448,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  Is that another figure of speech?
21449,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  The Army of the Dead is on the march.
21450,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  The Army of the Dead?
21451,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
21452,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  No, I don't think you're either of those things."
21453,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  The Army of the Dead is real.  The White Walkers are real.  The Knight King is real.  I've seen them.  If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --
21454,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  -- we're finished.
21455,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  I was born at Dragonstone.  Not that I can remember it.
21456,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.  Robert was your father's best friend, no?  I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib.  Not that it matters now of course.  I spent my life in foreign lands.  So many men have tried to kill me.  I don't remember all of their names.  I have been sold like a brood mare.  I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled.  Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile?  Faith.  Not in any gods.  Not in myths and legends.  In myself.  In Daenerys Targaryen.  The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born.  The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea.  Any sea."
21457,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  They did for me.  I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.  And I will.
21458,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.
21459,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  The war against my sister has already begun.  You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --
21460,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  -- whatever you saw beyond the wall.
21461,DAVOS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  You don't believe him.  I understand that.  It sounds like nonsense.
21462,DAVOS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.  You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros.  He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen.  He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.  He was named King in the North.  Not because of his birthright.  He has no birthright.  He's a damn bastard.  All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him."
21463,DAVOS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things.  He fought those things for the good of his people.  He risked his life for his people.  He took a knife in the heart for his people.  He gave his own --"
21464,DAVOS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die.  And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
21465,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.
21466,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys.  Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.
21467,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  There's no time for that.  There's no time for any of this.  While we stand here debating --
21468,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  It takes no time to bend the knee.  Pledge your sword to her cause.
21469,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  And why would I do that?
21470,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you.  As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name.  And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.  The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them.  And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
21471,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"  That's fair.  It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion."
21472,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  You must forgive my manners.  You will both be tired after your long journey.  We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
21473,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  Am I your prisoner?
21474,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  Not yet.
21475,VARYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.
21476,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  And?
21477,VARYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  Two or three ships escaped.  The rest sunk our captured.  Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured.  The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
21478,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,  All of them?
21479,CAPTAIN,7,63,the queen's justice,SEA OF DORNE_5,  Your sister's dead?
21480,THEON,7,63,the queen's justice,SEA OF DORNE_5,  Euron has her.
21481,CAPTAIN,7,63,the queen's justice,SEA OF DORNE_5,  You saw him take her?  And you got away?
21482,THEON,7,63,the queen's justice,SEA OF DORNE_5,  I couldn't save her.  I tried.
21483,CAPTAIN,7,63,the queen's justice,SEA OF DORNE_5,  You wouldn't be here if you tried.
21484,EURON,7,63,the queen's justice,KING'S LANDING - STREETS_1,  This is the life.  Look at them.  Cheering for a Greyjoy.
21485,EURON,7,63,the queen's justice,KING'S LANDING - STREETS_1,"  I have to be honest, it's making me hard.  Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?"
21486,EURON,7,63,the queen's justice,KING'S LANDING - STREETS_1,  Oh no!
21487,EURON,7,63,the queen's justice,KING'S LANDING - STREETS_1,  What a twat.
21488,EURON,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,  My queen.  Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.
21489,EURON,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,  I give you --
21490,EURON,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,  -- what no other man could give.  Justice.  Justice for your murdered daughter.
21491,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,  You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.
21492,EURON,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,  A bit more than a true friend.
21493,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,  And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
21494,EURON,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,  There's only one reward I want.
21495,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,  You shall have what your heart desires --
21496,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,  -- when the war is won.
21497,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,"  With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country."
21498,EURON,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,"  There's nothing quite like it, is there?  The love of the people.  I suppose you wouldn't know."
21499,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,"  This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
21500,EURON,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,"  Or yours.  They just like severed heads really.  Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers."
21501,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,  Advice?
21502,EURON,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,  Does she like it gentle or rough?  A finger in the bum?
21503,EURON,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,"  Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now.  We'll talk later."
21504,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  I want you to know I understand.  Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you.  I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head.  I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking."
21505,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  The sound of your scream.  I never heard a sound like that.  I thought, that's true love.  Oberyn looked beautiful that day.  He really did.  No one moved like him.  No one had such skill with a spear.  Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.  If only he hadn't taunted him.  He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.  But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?  Now he's burried somewhere.  And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever.  That must be difficult for you.  When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child.  I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse.  I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms.  I never got to have a mother.  But Myrcella did.  She was mine and you took her from me.  Why did you do that?"
21506,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  It doesn't matter now.
21507,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  Your daughter is a beauty too.  Brown eyes, those lips.  A perfect Dornish beauty."
21508,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  I imagine she is your favorite.
21509,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites.  But still, we're only human.  We love who we love."
21510,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  I'm sorry.  I can't understand you.  The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying.  It must be frustrating.
21511,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  We all make our choices.  You chose to murder my daughter.  You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
21512,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  Do you feel powerful now?  I don't sleep very well, not at all really.  I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies.  How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter.  I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's.  It would be poetic I suppose but fast.  Too fast."
21513,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
21514,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  She's so beautiful.  The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right."
21515,TYENE,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  Momma!
21516,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know.  Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.  The long goodbye, was that it?"
21517,QYBURN,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  The Long Farewell.
21518,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  That's the one.
21519,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  How long does the poison take?
21520,QYBURN,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  Difficult to say.  Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution."
21521,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  But death is certain?
21522,QYBURN,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain."
21523,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  Your daughter will die here in this cell.  You will be here watching when she does.  You will be here the rest of your days.  If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat.  You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made."
21524,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.  I don't want her to miss a thing.
21525,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS_1,  No.
21526,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS_1,  Don't.
21527,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS_1,  What are you doing?  No one can see us like this ?
21528,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS_1,  I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  I'll do as I please.
21529,MESSENGER,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS_1,"  Forgive me, Your Grace.  The visitor from Braavos has arrived."
21530,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS_1,  Good.  And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
21531,MESSENGER,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS_1,"  At once, Your Grace."
21532,TYCHO,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"  No, thank you."
21533,TYCHO,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"  My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son.  From all reports he was a fine young man."
21534,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.
21535,TYCHO,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  Condolences and congratulations.  You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms.  That's quite an accomplishment.  The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.
21536,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
21537,TYCHO,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  Indeed.  But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.
21538,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
21539,TYCHO,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"  Your father never minced words either.  But, yes, your debts are considerable.  And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts.  We both know how expensive war can be."
21540,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  And we both know gold wins wars.  Your vaults are empty.  Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.
21541,TYCHO,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies.  You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
21542,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
21543,TYCHO,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  We don't make bets.  We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
21544,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  That's a fancy way of saying bet.  The war has already begun.  I've drawn first blood.  I decapitated the Dornish snake.  My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
21545,TYCHO,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
21546,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
21547,TYCHO,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  For now.  Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons.  How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
21548,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"  Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.  Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl.  You want to invest in her?  I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade.  How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
21549,TYCHO,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"  The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true."
21550,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch.  In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
21551,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts.  Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
21552,TYCHO,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  Your father's daughter indeed.
21553,CERSEI,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  Give me a fortnight.  Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.
21554,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.  You're making it difficult.  You look a lot better brooding than I do.  You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
21555,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  I'm a prisoner on this island.
21556,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"  I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.  You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
21557,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  Except to my ship.  They took my ship.
21558,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  I wouldn't say we took your ship.
21559,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  I'm not playing word games with you.  The dead are coming for us all.
21560,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"  Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
21561,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  It's hard for me to fathom.  It really is.  If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
21562,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  You probably don't believe me.
21563,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  I do actually.
21564,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  You didn't before.  Grumpkins and snarks you called them.  Do you remember?  You said it was all nonsense.
21565,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"  It was all nonsense.  Everybody knew it.  But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
21566,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
21567,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  Good question.
21568,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  I know it's a good question.  I'm looking for an answer.
21569,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"  People's minds aren't made for problems that large.  White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
21570,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.  I can't help them from here.  I'd like to leave.
21571,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
21572,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"  Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.  Don't go south.  Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader.  And here I am.  A northern fool."
21573,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"  Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us.  And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye.  Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't.  Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now.  While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter.  She protects people from monsters, just as you do.  That's why she came here.  And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting.  That's not a reasonable thing to ask."
21574,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  So do you have anything reasonable to ask?
21575,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  What do you mean?
21576,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  Maybe you are a northern fool.  I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
21577,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,  Dragonglass?
21578,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,"  Yes.  Volcanic glass, obsidian.  He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
21579,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,  Why are we talking about glass?  We just lost two of our allies.
21580,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,"  Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
21581,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,  And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
21582,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,"  Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them.  I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
21583,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,  And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
21584,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,"  I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
21585,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,  Which wise man said this?
21586,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,  I don't remember.
21587,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,  Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
21588,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,"  I would never do that...to you.  The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.  All of his advisors would have told him not to come.  I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway.  You don't have to believe him.  Let him mine the Dragonglass.  If he's wrong it's worthless.  You didn't even know it was here.  It's nothing to you.  Give him something by giving him nothing.  Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally.  Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand.  Casterly Rock."
21589,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,  What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people?  Did you notice that?
21590,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,  You must allow them their flights of fancy.  It's dreary in the north.
21591,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  Amazing thing to see.
21592,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.
21593,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  You lost two brothers as well?
21594,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are.  Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
21595,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  You've been talking to Tyrion?
21596,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  He is my Hand.
21597,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  He enjoys talking.
21598,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  We all enjoy what we're good at.
21599,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  I don't.
21600,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
21601,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  I never expected that you would.
21602,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
21603,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  I haven't either.
21604,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it.  Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
21605,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  Thank you.
21606,JON,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,  So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
21607,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,"  You better get to work, Jon Snow."
21608,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,  How much do we have?
21609,WOLKAN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  4,000 bushels, My Lady."
21610,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,  What does that mean?
21611,YOHN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more."
21612,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,  What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
21613,WOLKAN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,  I'm not entirely certain.  I'll check Maester Llewyn's records.  He kept a copy of every raven scroll.
21614,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell."
21615,WOLKAN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  No, My Lady, most likely not."
21616,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  We must prepare for that eventuality.  Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be.  We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north.  If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them."
21617,YOHN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  Very wise, My Lady."
21618,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?"
21619,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,  Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
21620,YOHN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  No, My Lady."
21621,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?"
21622,YOHN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  They should indeed.  Pardon me, My Lady."
21623,YOHN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  You there, why isn't there leather on these?"
21624,BAELISH,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,  Command suits you.  The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
21625,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,  So they should be.
21626,BAELISH,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,  I know Cersei better than anyone here.  If you turn your back on her --
21627,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,  You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
21628,BAELISH,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,  I only meant to say --
21629,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous?  Thank you for your wise council."
21630,BAELISH,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  One of two things will happen.  Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end.  Or life will win out.  And what then?"
21631,BAELISH,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  Don't fight in the north or the south.  Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind.  Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once.  Live that way and nothing will surprise you.  Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."
21632,GUARD,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  Lady Sansa, at the gate."
21633,BRAN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"  Hello, Sansa."
21634,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,  I wish Jon was here.
21635,BRAN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,  Yes.  I need to speak to him.
21636,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,  Your father's last living true born son.  You're Lord of Winterfell.
21637,BRAN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,  I can never be the Lord of Winterfell.  I can never be lord of anything.  I'm the three-eyed raven.
21638,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,  I don't know what that means.
21639,BRAN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,  It's difficult to explain.
21640,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,"  Try, please, for me."
21641,BRAN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,"  It means I can see everything.  Everything that's ever happened to everyone.  Everything that's happening right now.  It's all pieces, fragments.  I need to learn to see better.  When the long night comes again I need to be ready."
21642,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,  How do you know all of this?
21643,BRAN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,  The three-eyed raven taught me.
21644,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,  I thought you were the three-eyed raven.
21645,BRAN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,  I told you it's difficult to explain.
21646,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,  Bran --
21647,BRAN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,  I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.  I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home.  It was so beautiful that night.  Snow falling just like now.  And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.
21648,SANSA,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,"  I have to go back inside, Bran."
21649,BRAN,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,  I'll stay a bit longer.
21650,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  Hmm.
21651,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  Hmm.  Does it hurt?
21652,JORAH,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  A bit.  Less than before.
21653,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  The infection no longer appears to be active.
21654,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  Unusual.  Unlikely.  One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.
21655,JORAH,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  I don't know anything about that.  I just started feeling better.  I assumed it was the rest that did it.
21656,JORAH,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  And the climate.
21657,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,"  The climate?  You're free to go, Ser.  This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer."
21658,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,"  Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening."
21659,JORAH,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  How bad is it?
21660,SAMWELL,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  I suppose I'll find out this evening.
21661,SAMWELL,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  Where will you go?
21662,JORAH,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.  I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could.  Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.  The only place for me is with her.
21663,JORAH,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  I owe my life to her and you.
21664,SAMWELL,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  Your father saved me more than once.  It's the least I could do.
21665,JORAH,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  Perhaps our paths will cross again?
21666,SAMWELL,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,  I hope they do.
21667,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,  You treated him?
21668,SAMWELL,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,  Yes.
21669,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,  Who told you to treat him?
21670,SAMWELL,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,  No one.
21671,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,  Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
21672,SAMWELL,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,  I seem to remember you.
21673,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,  But you treated him anyway?
21674,SAMWELL,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,  I did.
21675,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,"  I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful.  Especially on someone of that age.  You could have infected yourself and others.  You could have devastated the entire Citadel.  But you didn't.  It's a meticulous, difficult procedure.  Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed.  But you succeeded.  How?"
21676,SAMWELL,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,  I read the books and followed the instructions.
21677,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,  That man is alive because of you.  You should be proud.
21678,SAMWELL,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,"  Thank you, Archmaester."
21679,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,  Come here.
21680,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,  All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away.  I need you to make copies of them.
21681,MARWYN,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,  You were expecting a reward?  Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.  You'd better get started.  Be mindful of the paper mites.  They like flesh as well.
21682,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,  We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
21683,VARYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,"  Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet.  To send our remaining ships after him --"
21684,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,  I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
21685,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,  But you'll have to go yourself.  Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place.  You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
21686,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,"  I wouldn't be alone.  I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal.  What can anyone do to them?"
21687,MISSANDEI,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,  They can still do something to you.  It only takes one arrow.
21688,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,  It's too great a risk.  You're too important.
21689,DAENERYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,  What about Casterly Rock?
21690,VARYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,  The Unsullied will be there soon.
21691,MISSANDEI,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,  And what will they face?
21692,VARYS,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,  A difficult situation.  They know we're coming.
21693,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,  Yes.  Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister.  She will be ready.
21694,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK_1,  No one has ever taken the rock.
21695,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK_1,"  The Lannister army is still the army my father built.  Well trained and well provisioned.  10,000 men at least.  They will see us coming."
21696,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK_1,  They will be ready.
21697,MAN,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK_1,  Draw!  Loose!
21698,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK_1,  The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
21699,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK_1,  The fight up the walls will be hard.  We'll be at a disadvantage.  Many men will die.
21700,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_7,"  Interesting thing about my father.  He built our house up from near ruin.  He built our army.  He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers.  That was beneath him.  So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find.  Me.  He was right.  I was low.  The company I kept low, women mostly.  They weren't welcome at the Rock.  Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.  I couldn't walk them through the front gates.  I couldn't have them in my chambers.  So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself."
21701,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,  It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
21702,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,"  No better place for low pursuits.  Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress."
21703,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,"  As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."""
21704,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,  And so it begins.  They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.  They will be outnumbered.  They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
21705,TYRION,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,"  But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.  They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them.  They will be fighting for you.  And that is why they will triump."
21706,UNSULLIED 1,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,  There are none left.
21707,GREY WORM,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,  There are supposed to be more than this.  Many more.
21708,GREY WORM,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,  Where are they?  Where are the rest of the Lannisters?
21709,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  It's done?
21710,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  It is.
21711,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  And now the rains weep for our whores.  Did we fight well?
21712,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  I suppose as well as can be expected.
21713,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  It was never our forte.  Golden roses indeed.  Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
21714,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"  The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.  Well, it is to me.  My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne."
21715,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  So you'll just let them take it?
21716,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"  For now.  They won't be able to hold it.  Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left.  Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros."
21717,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"  And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?"
21718,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.  There are always lessons in failures.
21719,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  Yes.  You must be very wise by now.
21720,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  My father always said I was a slow learner.
21721,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"  If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry?  I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.  No more learning from my mistakes, eh?  How will you do it?  With that sword?"
21722,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"  That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?  Not that he ever used it.  What did he call it?"
21723,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  Widow's Wail.
21724,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"  He really was a cunt, wasn't he?  I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders.  I never lost a night's sleep over them.  They were necessary.  And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did.  But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining.  That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination.  She's a monster, you do know that?"
21725,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"  To you, sure.  To others as well.  But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
21726,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  You love her.  You really do love her.  You poor fool.  She'll be the end of you.
21727,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"  Possibly.  Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?"
21728,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  What better person to discuss it with?  What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room?  But perhaps you're right.  If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
21729,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"  Yes, it has."
21730,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  She's a disease.  I regret my role in spreading it.  You will too.
21731,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  I think we're done here.
21732,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  How will it happen?
21733,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  Cersei had several ideas.  Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.  Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.  I talked her out of those.
21734,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  Will there be pain?
21735,JAIME,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  No.  I made sure of that.
21736,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,  That's good.
21737,OLENNA,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"  I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple.  It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father.  It was horrible enough for me.  A shocking scene.  Not at all what I intended.  You see, I'd never seen the posion work before.  Tell Cersei.  I want her to know it was me."
21738,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  Halt that wagon!
21739,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  You just won the biggest prize in the world.  What could you possibly have to be upset about?  Come on.  You can tell me.  Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
21740,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
21741,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  There is no more High Septon.
21742,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,"  No, there isn't, is there?"
21743,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  There is still the question of my prize.
21744,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  That's a lot of money I just gave you.
21745,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  It's not a castle.
21746,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  How about that one?  It's available.
21747,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  You don't want Highgarden.
21748,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  I beg to differ.
21749,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,"  We're at war.  Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in.  Besides, think of the upkeep.  The more you own, the more it weighs you down."
21750,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,"  Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?  All your new riches weighing you down?"
21751,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  They're not mine.  The gold belongs to the Iron Bank.  We pay our debts.
21752,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  Right.  Just not to me.
21753,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,"  Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid.  When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you."
21754,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,"  Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful."
21755,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  Stranger things have happened.
21756,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  Like what?
21757,RANDYLL,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,"  The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord."
21758,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  The current harvest?
21759,DICKON,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.
21760,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,"  Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?"
21761,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  I'm not much for shoveling weight.
21762,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,"  No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that."
21763,RANDYLL,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  My Lord.
21764,DICKON,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_124,  My Lord.
21765,TYCHO,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"  I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment.  I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely."
21766,CERSEI,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"  You're too kind, My Lord."
21767,TYCHO,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"  I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace.  I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment.  And the current arithmetic is outstanding.  The gold --"
21768,CERSEI,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  Is on its way.  My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
21769,TYCHO,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.  They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
21770,CERSEI,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
21771,TYCHO,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  Yes.  Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.
21772,CERSEI,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
21773,TYCHO,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  I see a great deal of potential in that venture.  I imagine that it would require outside investment?
21774,CERSEI,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"  It will indeed.  I need to expand my armies, my navies.  My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
21775,TYCHO,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  I know them well.  They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
21776,CERSEI,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,  That's good to hear.  I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
21777,TYCHO,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"  Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives."
21778,BAELISH,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,  This is for you.
21779,BAELISH,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"  The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off."
21780,BAELISH,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"  The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have.  I wasn't there for her when she needed me most.  But I am here for her now.  To do what she would have done, to protect her children.  Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask."
21781,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,  Do you know who this belonged to?
21782,BAELISH,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"  No.  That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.  In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.  Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.  I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe."
21783,BAELISH,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"  To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --"
21784,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,  Chaos is a ladder.
21785,BAELISH,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"  I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark."
21786,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,  I'm not Lord Stark.
21787,MEERA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,  What's that?
21788,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,  Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.
21789,MEERA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,  It's a very good idea.
21790,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,  You're leaving?
21791,MEERA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"  I don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family.  And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now.  You don't need me anymore."
21792,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"  No, I don't."
21793,MEERA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,  That's all you've got to say?
21794,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,  Thank you.
21795,MEERA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,  Thank you?
21796,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,  For helping me.
21797,MEERA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,  My brother died for you.  Hodor and Summer died for you.  I almost died for you.  Bran!
21798,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"  I'm not really, not anymore.  I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now."
21799,MEERA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,  You died in that cave.
21800,MAN 1,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,"  Hey, oh.  Where are you going?"
21801,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  In there.  I live here.
21802,MAN 1,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  Fuck off.
21803,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  I'm Arya Stark.  This is my home.
21804,MAN 1,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  Arya Stark is dead.
21805,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick.  They'll tell you who I am.
21806,MAN 2,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  There's no Rodrick here.
21807,MAN 1,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  Maester's name is Wolkan.
21808,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,"  Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North.  He's my brother"
21809,MAN 1,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  He's a thousand miles away.
21810,MAN 2,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,"  It's cold.  We're busy.  So, you know, best fuck off."
21811,MAN 1,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  Mm-hmm.
21812,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
21813,MAN 2,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,"  The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark."
21814,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  Which Lady Stark?
21815,MAN 1,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  You tell us.  You're the one impersonating her sister.
21816,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  Tell Sansa her sister is home.
21817,MAN 1,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,"  Lady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you, just like us.  So for the last time, fuck off."
21818,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,"  I'm getting into this castle one way or another.  If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long.  But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away..."
21819,MAN 2,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  You sit there.  Right there.  Don't move.
21820,MAN 2,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  Go tell Lady Stark.  I'll watch her.
21821,MAN 1,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  You tell her.
21822,MAN 2,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  I'm not.
21823,MAN 1,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  Because if you don't I'll hit you right in the fucking face as hard as I can.
21824,MAN 2,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  We told her to wait.  We were standing right next to her.
21825,MAN 1,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,"  When we turned around she had gone, My Lady.  She was nothing.  Some winter town girl."
21826,MAN 2,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  She comes in asking for Ser Rodrick and Maester Llewyn.
21827,MAN 1,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,"  Don't trouble yourself over it, My Lady.  We'll find her."
21828,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  You don't have to.  I know where she is.
21829,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?
21830,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  Yes.
21831,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  You shouldn't have run from the guards.
21832,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  I didn't run.  You need better guards.
21833,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,"  It suits you, Lady Stark.  Jon left you in charge?"
21834,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,"  He did.  I hope he comes back soon.  I remember how happy he was to see me.  When he sees you, his heart will probably stop."
21835,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  That doesn't look like him.  It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
21836,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  Everyone who knew his face is dead.
21837,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  We're not.
21838,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  They say you killed Joffrey.  Did you?
21839,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  I wish I had.
21840,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  Me too.  I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.  However long my list got he was always first.
21841,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  Your list?
21842,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  Of people I'm going to kill.
21843,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  How did you get back to Winterfell?
21844,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  It's a long story.  I imagine yours is too.
21845,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,  Yes.  It's not a very pleasant one.
21846,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,"  Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet."
21847,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,"  No, they're not."
21848,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,"  Arya, Bran's home too."
21849,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  You came home.
21850,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  I saw you at the crossroads.
21851,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  You saw me?
21852,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  I see quite a lot now.
21853,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  Bran has visions.
21854,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  I thought you might go to King's Landing.
21855,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  So did I.
21856,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  Why would you go back there?
21857,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  Cersei is on her list of names.
21858,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  Who else is on your list?
21859,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  Most of them are dead already.
21860,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  Where did you get this?
21861,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  Littlefinger gave it to me.
21862,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,"  Littlefinger, he's here?"
21863,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  He's declared for House Stark.
21864,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  Why would he give you a dagger?
21865,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  He thought I'd want it.
21866,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  Why?
21867,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  Because it was meant to kill me.
21868,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  The cutthroat after your fall?
21869,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
21870,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
21871,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  He's not a generous man.  He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.
21872,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  It doesn't matter.
21873,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  What do you mean it doesn't matter?
21874,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  I don't want it.
21875,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  Are you sure?  It's Valyrian steel.
21876,BRAN,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,  It's wasted on a cripple.
21877,PODRICK,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  Catelyn Stark would be proud.  You kept your vow.
21878,BRIENNE,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  I did next to nothing.
21879,PODRICK,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - GATE_1,"  You're too hard on yourself, My Lady."
21880,BRIENNE,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - GATE_1,  I'm not a --
21881,BRIENNE,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - GATE_1,"  Thank you, Podrick."
21882,MISSANDEI,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,"  Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied."
21883,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  Soon.  They will come back to me.
21884,MISSANDEI,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  He better.
21885,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  What happened?
21886,MISSANDEI,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  Many things.
21887,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  Many things?
21888,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  Your Grace.
21889,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  It's all right.
21890,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.
21891,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,"  So this is it, all we'll ever need."
21892,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,"  There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace."
21893,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  The Children of the Forest made these.
21894,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  When?
21895,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  A very long time ago.
21896,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.  Maybe even before there were men.
21897,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  No.
21898,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  They were here together the Children and the First Men.
21899,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  Doing what?  Fighting each other?
21900,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,"  They fought together against their common enemy.  Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together.  We need to do the same if we're going to survive."
21901,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  Because the enemy is real.  It's always been real.
21902,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
21903,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,"  No, I don't think I can."
21904,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  I will fight for you.  I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
21905,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,"  My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered."
21906,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  They will if their king does.  They chose you to lead them.  They chose you to protect them.  Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
21907,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  What is it?
21908,TYRION,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  We took Casterly Rock.
21909,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  That's very good to hear.
21910,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,  Isn't it?
21911,DAVOS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.  Perhaps --
21912,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  You will stay.  All my allies are gone.  They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
21913,TYRION,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  We still have the largest army.
21914,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
21915,TYRION,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.  We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.  Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.  We have a plan.  It's still the right plan.
21916,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"  The right plan?  Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach."
21917,TYRION,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  If I've underestimated our enemies --
21918,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"  Our enemies?  Your family, you mean.  Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all."
21919,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  Enough with the clever plans.
21920,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  I have three large dragons.  I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
21921,TYRION,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  We've discussed this.
21922,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  My enemies are in the Red Keep.  What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
21923,TYRION,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  A smart one.
21924,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  What do you think I should do?
21925,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  I would never presume to --
21926,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  I'm at war.  I'm losing.
21927,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  What do you think I should do?
21928,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,  I never thought that dragons would exist again.  No one did.  The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen.  Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen.  Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
21929,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"  But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different.  You're just more of the same."
21930,BRIENNE,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,  Don't lunge.
21931,BRIENNE,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,  Don't go where your enemy leads you.
21932,BRIENNE,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,  Up.
21933,BRIENNE,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,  And don't --
21934,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,  Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
21935,BRIENNE,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,  Nice sword.  Very nice dagger.
21936,SANSA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,  If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --
21937,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,  It's been awhile since I've trained.
21938,BRIENNE,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,"  I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady."
21939,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,  He didn't beat the hound.  You did.  I want to train with you.
21940,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,"  You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?"
21941,BRIENNE,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,"  Move aside, Podrick."
21942,BRIENNE,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,"  You can't use that, My Lady.  It's too small."
21943,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,  I won't cut you.  Don't worry.
21944,BRIENNE,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,  I'll try not to.
21945,BRIENNE,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,  Who taught you to do that?
21946,ARYA,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,  No one.
21947,DAVOS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  What do you think of her?
21948,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  Who?
21949,DAVOS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  I believe you know of whom I speak.
21950,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  I think she has a good heart.
21951,DAVOS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  A good heart?  I've noticed you starring at that good heart.
21952,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"  There's no time for that.  I saw the Night King, Davos.  I looked into his eyes.  How many men do we have in the north to fight him?  10,000?  Less?"
21953,DAVOS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  Fewer.
21954,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  What?
21955,DAVOS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"  Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth."
21956,MISSANDEI,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"  Ser Davos, Lord Snow."
21957,DAVOS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"  King Snow, isn't it?  No?  That doesn't sound right.  King Jon?"
21958,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  It doesn't matter.
21959,MISSANDEI,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"  Forgive me, but may I ask a question?"
21960,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  Of course.
21961,MISSANDEI,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"  Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?"
21962,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  I'm a bastard.  My mother and father weren't married.
21963,DAVOS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  Is the custom different in Naarth?
21964,MISSANDEI,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
21965,DAVOS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  The sounds liberating.
21966,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  Why did you leave your homeland?
21967,MISSANDEI,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  I was stolen away by slavers.
21968,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  I'm sorry.
21969,DAVOS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"  If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?"
21970,MISSANDEI,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  She bought me from my master and set me free.
21971,DAVOS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"  That was good of her.  Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?"
21972,MISSANDEI,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.  Because I believe in her.
21973,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --
21974,MISSANDEI,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.
21975,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  You believe that?
21976,MISSANDEI,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"  I know it.  All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her.  She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew.  She's the queen we chose."
21977,DAVOS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  You'll forgive me if I switch sides.
21978,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,  Is that a Greyjoy ship?
21979,THEON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,  Jon.  I didn't know you were here.
21980,THEON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,"  Sansa, is she all right?"
21981,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,  What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.
21982,DAVOS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,  We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.  We thought you were dead.
21983,THEON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,  I should be.
21984,DAVOS,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,  Your sister?
21985,THEON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,  Euron has her.  I came to ask the queen to help get her back.
21986,JON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,  The queen is gone.
21987,THEON,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,  Where did she go?
21988,RANDYLL,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  All of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.
21989,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Good.
21990,RANDYLL,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,"  We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall.  If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time."
21991,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  We are stretched a bit thin.
21992,RANDYLL,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,"  With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility."
21993,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Let's give them fair warning first.  These men fought well at Highgarden.
21994,DICKON,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Ser Jaime.
21995,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Rickon.
21996,DICKON,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Dickon.
21997,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.  Your first battle?
21998,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  And?
21999,DICKON,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  It was glorious.
22000,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Come on.  Your father's not here.
22001,DICKON,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  All my life we've been pledged to House Tyrell.  I knew some of those men.  I hunted with them.
22002,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  They didn't deserve to die.  But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl.  So here we are.
22003,DICKON,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  I didn't expect it to smell like that.
22004,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Men shit themselves when they die.  Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?
22005,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,"  Well, I learned it when I was 5."
22006,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  What?
22007,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Listen.
22008,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Spears and shields!  Spears and shields!
22009,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Spears and shields!
22010,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  In line now!
22011,RANDYLL,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,"  Come on, lads.  Not those wagons.  Fall in line.  Fall in line."
22012,RANDYLL,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Spears armed!
22013,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Get back to King's Landing.
22014,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  I'm not abandoning my army.
22015,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,"  You're a commander, not a damned infantryman.  These fuckers are about to swamp us."
22016,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  We can hold them off.
22017,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Dracarys!
22018,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Hold the line!
22019,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Archers!  Archers with me!
22020,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Knock!
22021,ARCHERS,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Knock!  Draw!
22022,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Loose!
22023,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Qyburn's scorpion is over there.
22024,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Go get it then.
22025,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  I can't shoot with one hand.
22026,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Come on!
22027,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Where are you?
22028,GUARD,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Your people can't fight.
22029,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Take cover!
22030,BRONN,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Come on you fucker.
22031,DAENERYS,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  Dracarys!
22032,TYRION,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,"  Flee, you idiot!"
22033,JAIME,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,"  Come on, boy.  Come on!"
22034,TYRION,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,  You fucking idiot.
22035,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_125,  You could have killed me.
22036,BRONN,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_125,  What the fuck were you doing back there?
22037,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_125,  Ending the war by killing her.
22038,BRONN,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_125,  You saw the dragon between you and her?
22039,BRONN,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_125,  And?
22040,BRONN,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_125,"  Listen to me, cunt.  Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you.  You don't get to kill you.  Only I get to kill you."
22041,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_125,"  That was only one of them.  She has two more.  If she decides to use them, to really use them --"
22042,BRONN,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_125,  You're fucked.
22043,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_125,  Don't you mean we're fucked?
22044,BRONN,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_125,"  No, I do not.  Dragons are where our partnership ends.  I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing."
22045,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_125,  I have to tell Cersei.
22046,BRONN,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_125,  Best well jump back in that river.
22047,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"  I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --"
22048,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"  -- burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children.  That's Cersei Lannister, not me.  I'm not here to murder.  And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world.  I offer you a choice.  Bend the knee and join me.  Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die."
22049,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"  Step forward, My Lord."
22050,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,  You will not kneel?
22051,RANDYLL,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,  I already have a queen.
22052,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"  My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time.  So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible."
22053,RANDYLL,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"  There are no easy choices in war.  Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life.  You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader.  One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back."
22054,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,  You will not trade your honor for your life.  I respect that.
22055,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"  Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace.  Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier.  He would be invaluable at the Wall."
22056,RANDYLL,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,  You cannot send me to the Wall.  You are not my queen.
22057,DICKON,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,  You will have to kill me too.
22058,RANDYLL,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,  Step back and shut your mouth.
22059,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,  Who are you?
22060,RANDYLL,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,  A stupid boy.
22061,DICKON,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"  I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley."
22062,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,  You are the future of your house.  This war has already wiped one great house from the world.  Don't let it happen again.  Bend the knee.
22063,DICKON,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,  I will not.
22064,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"  Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell."
22065,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,  I meant what I said.  I'm not here to put men in chains.  If that becomes an option many will take it.  I gave them a choice.  They made it.
22066,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"  Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
22067,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,  I'm not beheading anyone.
22068,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,  Your Grace --
22069,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"  Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die."
22070,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,  Dracarys.
22071,QYBURN,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,  My Lord.
22072,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,  How many men did we lose?
22073,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,  We haven't done a full counting.
22074,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,"  It's armies that win wars.  We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us.  We can buy mercenaries."
22075,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,"  They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be."
22076,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,"  I just saw the Dothraki fight.  They'll beat any mercenary army.  They'll beat any army I've ever seen.  Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.  Her dragon burned a thousand wagons.  Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.  They couldn't stop it.  And she has three of them.  This isn't a war we can win."
22077,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,"  So what do we do?  Sue for peace?  I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered.  And in her mind she's winning.  What sort of offer do you think she'd make?"
22078,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,  Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
22079,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,  He didn't.
22080,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,"  You saw the crossbow, you saw his body."
22081,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,  I'm not talking about father.  Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.  He had nothing to do with it.
22082,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,  After all this time it still amazes me --
22083,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,  It was Olenna.  She confessed before she died.
22084,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,  And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
22085,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,  After.
22086,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,  And you believed her?
22087,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,  If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen?  Which one would Margerey been better able to control?  Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?  She was telling the truth.
22088,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,  I shouldn't have listened to you.  She should have died screaming.
22089,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,"  She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house.  And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them."
22090,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,  So we fight and die or we submit and die.  I know my choice.  A soldier should know his.
22091,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"  They're beautiful, aren't they?"
22092,JON,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"  That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are.  Gorgeous beasts."
22093,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"  They're not beasts to me.  No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children."
22094,JON,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  You weren't gone long.
22095,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  No.
22096,JON,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  And?
22097,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
22098,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  You're not sure how you feel about that?
22099,JON,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"  No, I'm not."
22100,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
22101,JON,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  Thousands.
22102,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  We both want to help people.  We can only help them from a position of strength.  Sometimes strength is terrible.  When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
22103,JON,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  Ser Davos gets carried away.
22104,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  So it was a figure of speech?
22105,GUARD,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"  This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi."
22106,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  He is my friend.
22107,JORAH,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  Your Grace.
22108,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"  Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend."
22109,JON,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  I served with your father.  He was a great man.
22110,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  You look strong.  You found a cure?
22111,JORAH,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"  I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.  I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
22112,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,  It would be my honor.
22113,BRAN,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_5,  Ravens.  We need to send ravens.
22114,MAESTER 1,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"  I put very little stock in it myself.  Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes."
22115,MARWYN,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  I remember Wolkan.   A bit timid but a sharp mind.
22116,MAESTER 1,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"  The north has dulled many good maester's wits.  I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company."
22117,MAESTER 1,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.
22118,MARWYN,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  It is a bit much.  Still we ought to --
22119,SAMWELL,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  Brandon Stark --
22120,SAMWELL,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  -- the crippled boy.
22121,MARWYN,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  Do you know him?
22122,SAMWELL,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  I let him through the Wall years ago.  I saw him go beyond the wall.
22123,MARWYN,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  And?
22124,SAMWELL,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"  Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could.  Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one.  Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say."
22125,MAESTER 1,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.
22126,MARWYN,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.
22127,SAMWELL,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"  Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.  If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it.  If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it.  And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good."
22128,MARWYN,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  It could be done.  And this news could be authentic.  It's possible.  It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.
22129,MAESTER 1,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.
22130,SAMWELL,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"  Archmaester, please.  It's real.  I've seen it."
22131,MARWYN,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification.  I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
22132,SAMWELL,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  Archmaester --
22133,MARWYN,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"  That will be all, Tarley."
22134,MAESTER 2,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"  It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest."
22135,MAESTER 1,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.
22136,MAESTER 1,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?
22137,MARWYN,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  I'm afraid so.
22138,MAESTER 2,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  Horrible business.
22139,MARWYN,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  I don't have the heart to tell him yet.  He's a good lad.
22140,MARWYN,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  Right.  The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...
22141,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,  All rulers demand that people bend the knee.  It's why they're rulers.  She gave Tarley a choice.  A man who had taken up arms against her.  What else could she do?
22142,VARYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,  Not burn him alive alongside his son.
22143,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,"  I am her hand, not her head.  I can't make her decisions for her."
22144,VARYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,  That's what I used to tell myself about her father.  I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive.  I was only a purveyor of information.
22145,VARYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,"  It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it.""  As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it.""  When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it."""
22146,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,  Daenerys is not her father.
22147,VARYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,  And she never will be... with the right counsel.  You need to find a way to make her listen.
22148,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,  Who is that for?
22149,VARYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,  Jon Snow.
22150,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,  Did you read it?
22151,VARYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,  It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
22152,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,  What's it say?
22153,VARYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,  Nothing good.
22154,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  I thought Arya was dead.  I thought Bran was dead.
22155,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  I'm happy for you.  You don't look happy.
22156,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch.  If they make it past the wall --
22157,VARYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years.  Presumably --
22158,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  I need to go home.
22159,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  You said you don't have enough men.
22160,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  We'll fight with the men we have.  Unless you'll join us.
22161,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  And give the country to Cersei?  As soon as I march away she marches in.
22162,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  Perhaps not.  Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children.  What if we prove her wrong?
22163,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
22164,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  So bring the dead to her.
22165,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
22166,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  We don't have to bring the whole army.  Only one soldier.
22167,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  Is that possible?
22168,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
22169,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
22170,VARYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
22171,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  The only person she listens to is Jaime.  He may listen to me.
22172,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  And how would you get into King's Landing.
22173,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,"  I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter."
22174,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,"  Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men."
22175,VARYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  Fair point.  How do you propose to find one?
22176,JORAH,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
22177,JORAH,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.  Allow me to serve you.
22178,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  The free folk will help us.  They know the real north better than anyone.
22179,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  They won't follow Ser Jorah.
22180,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  They won't have to.
22181,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  You can't lead a raid beyond the wall.  You're not in the Night's Watch anymore.  You're King in the North.
22182,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  I'm the only one here whose fought them.  I'm the only one here who knows them.
22183,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,  I haven't given you permission to leave.
22184,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,"  With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.  I am a king.  And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive.  I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people.  Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance."
22185,ROBETT,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - THE GREAT HALL_1,"  The King in the North should stay in the north.  We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have."
22186,YOHN,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - THE GREAT HALL_1,"  The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark."
22187,SANSA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - THE GREAT HALL_1,"  You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king.  He is doing what he thinks is best."
22188,SANSA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  I warned Jon this would happen.  He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
22189,ARYA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  He didn't.  He trusted you to hold it for him.
22190,SANSA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,"  Well, he's not making it easy.  The northern lords are proud."
22191,ARYA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  These are mother and father's chambers.
22192,SANSA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  And?
22193,ARYA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  Nothing.
22194,SANSA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  Don't do that.
22195,ARYA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  What?
22196,SANSA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  Say what you mean.
22197,ARYA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  You always liked nice things.  It made you feel better than everyone.
22198,SANSA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  Are you angry with me?
22199,ARYA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
22200,SANSA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,"  I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell."
22201,ARYA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  Their opinions are important to you?
22202,SANSA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,"  Glover has 500 men.  Royce has 2,000.  Offend them and Jon loses his army."
22203,ARYA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  Not if they lose their heads first.
22204,SANSA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,"  Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands.  We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together.  Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together."
22205,ARYA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,"  And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want."
22206,SANSA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  How can you even think such a horrible thing?
22207,ARYA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,"  You're thinking it right now.  You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away."
22208,SANSA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  I have work to do.
22209,ARYA,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,  My lady.
22210,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,  Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
22211,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,  Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.
22212,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,  There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.  The guards hardly ever patrol it.  Too many steps.
22213,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,  You're not staying here?
22214,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,  I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
22215,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,  What if someone takes the boat?
22216,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,  Then we're fucked.  Best hurry.
22217,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  We don't have time for this.  We should be preparing the city for a siege.  The Dothraki are coming.
22218,BRONN,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  All the more reason for you to train.  Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
22219,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
22220,BRONN,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  And here I am ready to train.
22221,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  Why down here?
22222,BRONN,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
22223,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
22224,BRONN,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  Oh, you won't be swinging it at me."
22225,BRONN,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  I'll leave you to it.
22226,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
22227,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  You made me look like a complete fool.  I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me.  You abandoned the family home.  Completely unsentimental.  Father would have been proud."
22228,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  Don't talk about our father.
22229,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  Listen to me --
22230,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
22231,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
22232,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"  He was going to execute me.  He knew I was innocent.  He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am.  The little monster sent to punish him.  Do you think I wanted to be born this way?  Did he think I chose --"
22233,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  What do you want?
22234,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  Daenerys will win this war.  You're a military man.  You must know there is no way around it.  Daenerys is not her father.  She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
22235,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
22236,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,  I -- I don't.  Daenerys doesn't.  Not right now anyway.  She has a more important request.
22237,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,  I wasn't sure I'd find you.
22238,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,  I thought you might still be rowing.
22239,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,"  I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.  I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel."
22240,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,  Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
22241,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,  I haven't been here in years.  Why should they recognize me?  Sometimes I hardly do.  Nothing fucks you harder than time.
22242,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,  Anybody give you any trouble?
22243,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,  Here I am arming Lannisters.  I never get a second look.  You were right.  Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
22244,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,  Don't be so sure.  Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.  Bad things are coming.
22245,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,  You came to get me.  You want me to come with you.
22246,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,  I think you need to understand --
22247,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,  I'm ready.  Let's go.
22248,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,  You should know what you're heading into.
22249,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,  Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father?  They tried to kill me.
22250,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,"  I've been getting ready.  I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes."
22251,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,  You might want to bring one of those swords.
22252,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,"  I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --"
22253,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,  -- this I know.
22254,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Keep your father's name to yourself.  The situation is complicated enough already.
22255,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Who should I say I am?
22256,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,"  I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --"
22257,GUARD 1,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  You there.
22258,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,"  No weapons, friends.  I promise.  What can I do for you?"
22259,GUARD 1,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Is that your boat?
22260,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  It is.
22261,GUARD 2,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  The docks are that way.
22262,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  That they are.  I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.
22263,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Still five gold dragons?
22264,GUARD 1,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Are you joking?
22265,GUARD 2,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  You must be even older than you look.  15.
22266,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  15?
22267,GUARD 1,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Apiece.
22268,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
22269,GUARD 1,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  What's in the boat?
22270,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Not more gold.
22271,GUARD 2,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Wine?
22272,GUARD 1,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Mmm.
22273,GUARD 2,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  I like wine.
22274,GUARD 1,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Or hams.
22275,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Come and have a look.
22276,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Fermented crab.
22277,GUARD 2,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  What?
22278,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,"  Fermented crab.  One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week.  A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.  Five minutes later, he's back in the race.  Here, have a taste."
22279,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.
22280,GUARD 2,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,"  Oi, Dwarf!"
22281,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.
22282,GUARD 2,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  That dwarf --
22283,GUARD 1,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Where did you get that scar?
22284,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Fish hook.  Some men you just can't teach.
22285,GUARD 2,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.
22286,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Perhaps there's some arrangement?
22287,GUARD 2,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  Arrangement?  You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?
22288,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  This is Gendry.
22289,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,  He'll do.
22290,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  That won't be necessary.
22291,QYBURN,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  Ser Jaime.
22292,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  Why was QYBURN here?
22293,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  He's Hand of the Queen.  Why are you here?
22294,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  I met with Tyrion.
22295,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  What did our brother have to say?
22296,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  Daenerys wants to meet.
22297,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  To discuss a surrender?
22298,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  To discuss an armistice.
22299,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  She just won a great victory.  Why would she want a truce now?
22300,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.  Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
22301,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  Are you going to punish him?
22302,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  Tyrion?
22303,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  Bronn.
22304,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  He betrayed you.  He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent.  Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
22305,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  You let it happen.  Why?
22306,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,"  I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest.  She has the numbers.  If we want to beat her we have to be clever.  We have to fight her like father would have.  Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house.  For this."
22307,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  Who will you say is the father?
22308,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  You.
22309,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  People won't like that.
22310,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  Do you remember what father used to say about people?
22311,JAIME,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
22312,CERSEI,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,  Never betray me again.
22313,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  We're leaving today.  The king's got a lot on his mind.
22314,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  I understand.
22315,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
22316,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  You don't have to worry.
22317,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"  You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges."
22318,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  Understood.
22319,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"  Begging your pardon, Your Grace."
22320,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  You survived King's Landing.
22321,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  Yet again.
22322,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"  Your Grace, this is --"
22323,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"  It's Gendry, Your Grace.  I'm Robert Baratheon's son.  Bastard son."
22324,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  He was meant to keep that to himself.
22325,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  Our fathers trusted each other.  Why shouldn't we?
22326,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  I saw your father once at Winterfell.
22327,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  I met yours in my shop.
22328,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  You're a lot leaner.
22329,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  You're a lot shorter.
22330,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  I grew up on stories about them.
22331,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"  All I ever knew was they fought together and won.  Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why.  Let me come with you."
22332,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  Don't be a fool.  You're not a soldier.
22333,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"  No, but I'm a fighter.  And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that."
22334,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  Do you know how to use one?
22335,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"  Well, that's a problem."
22336,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  I prefer a hammer.
22337,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  He can handle himself.
22338,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  We could use the help.
22339,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"  As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life."
22340,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"  I owe you my life.  Twice over.  But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war."
22341,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,  Yeah.  Nobody mind me.  All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
22342,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,"  You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont.  Nobody glowers quite like you.  Not even Grey Worm."
22343,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,  This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us.  Remember?
22344,JORAH,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,  It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
22345,TYRION,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,  Take it with you.  You'll bring it back.  Our queen needs you.
22346,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,  We should be better at saying farewell by now.
22347,JORAH,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,"  Your Grace, I --"
22348,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,  If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.
22349,DAENERYS,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,  But I've grown used to him.
22350,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,"  I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace."
22351,JON,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,  Heave!
22352,GILLY,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,  Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?
22353,SAM,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,  No.
22354,GILLY,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,"  15,782."
22355,GILLY,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,  Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.
22356,SAMWELL,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,  None anymore.
22357,GILLY,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,"  That's true.  This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything.  He even recorded his own bowel movements.  What does ""annulment"" mean?"
22358,SAMWELL,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,  It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
22359,GILLY,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,  Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne.  Is that a common thing --
22360,SAMWELL,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,"  These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored.  But that's all right, isn't it.  We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynard's 15,782 shits."
22361,GILLY,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,  Steps.  That number was steps.
22362,GILLY,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. CITADEL_1,  Are you sure you want to do this?  You always wanted to be a maester.
22363,SAMWELL,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. CITADEL_1,  I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.
22364,WOLKAN,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_3,"  I found it, my Lord."
22365,WOLKAN,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_3,  It took some searching.  Maester Llewyn's archives are thorough.
22366,BAELISH,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_3,  Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?
22367,WOLKAN,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_3,"  Yes, my Lord."
22368,BAELISH,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_3,  Lady Stark thanks you for your service.
22369,"""ROBB, I WRITE TO YOU WITH A HEAVY HEART. OUR GOOD KING ROBERT IS DEAD, KILLED FROM WOUNDS HE TOOK IN A BOAR HUNT. FATHER HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH TREASON.

I BEG YOU",7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_3," come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithfull sister, Sansa."""
22370,TORMUND,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,  Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?
22371,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,  I've been failing at that job of late.
22372,TORMUND,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,  How many queens are there now?
22373,JON,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,  Two.
22374,TORMUND,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,  And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?
22375,JON,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,  Both.
22376,TORMUND,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,  How many men did you bring?
22377,JON,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,  Not enough.
22378,TORMUND,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,  The big woman?
22379,JORAH,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,  We were hoping some of your men could help.
22380,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,  I'll be staying behind.  I'm a liability out there as you well know.
22381,TORMUND,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,  You are.
22382,TORMUND,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,  You really want to go out there again?
22383,TORMUND,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,  You're not the only ones.
22384,TORMUND,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall.  Said they were on their way here.
22385,JON,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  You're The Hound.  I saw you once at Winterfell.
22386,TORMUND,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  They want to go beyond the Wall too.
22387,BERIC,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,"  We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to.  Our lord told us the great war is coming."
22388,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  Don't trust them.  Don't trust any of them.
22389,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  They're the Brotherhood.  And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.
22390,JORAH,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  Thoros?
22391,JORAH,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  I hardly recognized you.
22392,THOROS,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  Ser Jorah Mormont --
22393,THOROS,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  They won't give me anything to drink down here.  I haven't been feeling like myself.
22394,TORMUND,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  You're a fucking Mormont?  Like the last Lord Commander?
22395,JORAH,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  He was my father.
22396,TORMUND,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  He hunted us like animals.
22397,JORAH,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,"  You returned the favor, as I recall."
22398,BERIC,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.
22399,DAVOS,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  Our reasons aren't your reasons.
22400,BERIC,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
22401,BERIC,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not.  We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --
22402,SANDOR,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,"  For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole.  Are we coming with you or not?"
22403,JORAH,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  Don't you want to know what we're doing?
22404,THOROS,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?
22405,JON,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  He's right.  We're all on the same side.
22406,GENDRY,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  How can we be?
22407,JON,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,  We're all breathing.
22408,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  Are you all right?
22409,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  Ever been north before?
22410,GENDRY,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  Never seen snow before.
22411,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"  Beautiful, eh?  I can breath again.  Down south the air smells like pig shit."
22412,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  You've never been down south.
22413,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  I've been to Winterfell.
22414,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  That's the north.
22415,GENDRY,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  How do you live up here?  How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
22416,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"  You have to keep moving.  That's the secret.  Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best."
22417,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
22418,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  We have to make due with what we've got.
22419,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  This one is maybe not so smart.
22420,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  Davos says he is a strong fighter.
22421,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  Good.  That's more important than being smart.
22422,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"  Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead.  So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?  And?"
22423,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
22424,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"  You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling.  Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man.  The king beyond the wall never bent the knee.  How many of his people died for his pride?"
22425,THOROS,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"  Are you still mad at us, boy?"
22426,GENDRY,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  You sold me to a witch.
22427,THOROS,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"  Priestess.  I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction."
22428,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  We're fighting a great war.  Wars cost money.
22429,GENDRY,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"  I wanted to be one of you.  I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave.  Do you know what she did to me?  She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --"
22430,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  Sounds all right so far.
22431,GENDRY,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  -- and put leeches on me.
22432,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  Was she naked too?
22433,THOROS,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  She needed your blood.
22434,GENDRY,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  Yes. Thank you.  I know that.
22435,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  It could have been worse.
22436,GENDRY,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  She wanted to kill me.  They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
22437,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"  But they didn't, did they?  So what you whinging about?"
22438,GENDRY,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  I'm not whinging.
22439,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.  That's whinging.
22440,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  This one's been killed six times.  You don't hear him bitching about it.
22441,THOROS,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  Good lad.
22442,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
22443,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  He was a good man.  He deserved a better son.  Were you with him at the end?
22444,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  I was a prisoner of the Wildlings.  But we avenged him.  I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
22445,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"  I can't think of a worse way for him to go.  The Night's Watch was his life.  He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him."
22446,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  I hate that he died that way.  My father was the most honorable man I ever met.  He was good all the way through.  And he died on the executioner's block.
22447,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  Your father wanted to execute me.
22448,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  I heard.
22449,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  He was in the right of course.  It didn't make me hate him any less.
22450,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  I'm glad he didn't capture you.
22451,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  Me too.
22452,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"  Your father gave me this sword.  He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw."
22453,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
22454,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries.  It's not right for me to have it.
22455,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  He gave it to you.
22456,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  I'm not his son.
22457,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  I brought shame to my house.  I broke my father's heart.
22458,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,  I forfeited the right to claim this sword.  It's yours.  May it serve you well and your children after you.
22459,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  Father used to watch us from up here.  He wouldn't say much.  You probably don't remember.  You were inside knitting all the time.
22460,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  I remember.
22461,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"  One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick.  I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground.  Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw.  There was one arrow in the target.  There was no one around, just like now.  No one to stop me.  So I started shooting.  And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.  I wasn't very good.  Finally I hit the bullseye.  It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th.  I don't remember.  But I hit the bullseye and I heard this."
22462,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me.  I knew what I was doing was against the rules.  But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong.  The rules were wrong.  I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.  Now he's dead.  Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
22463,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  What?
22464,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"  That's your pretty handwriting.  Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you.  ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart.  Our good King Robert is dead.  Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --"
22465,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  You don't have to read it.  I remember.
22466,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"  ""Father has been charged with treason.  He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne.  The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort.  I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark.  Your faithful sister, Sansa."""
22467,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  They forced me to do it.
22468,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  Did they.  With a knife at your throat?  Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
22469,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  You don't know what it was like.  I was a child.
22470,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  So was I.  I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
22471,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  They told me it was the only way to save father.
22472,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  And you were stupid enough to believe them.  I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block.  I remember the pretty dress you were wearing.  I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
22473,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  You were there?
22474,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
22475,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  And what did you do?  Did you come running to the rescue?  Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
22476,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  I wanted to.
22477,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  But you didn't.  Just like me.
22478,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  I didn't betray him.  I didn't betray Robb.  I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
22479,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"  You should be on your knees thanking me.  We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.  You didn't win it back.  Jon didn't win it back.  He lost the Battle of the Bastards.  The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?"
22480,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  I was training.
22481,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"  Training.  Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine."
22482,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"  Oh, I don't know about that.  I can imagine quite a lot."
22483,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  You never would have survived what I survived.
22484,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  I guess we'll never know.
22485,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  What are you doing to do with that letter.
22486,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  I don't know yet.
22487,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  Who did you show it to?  Where did you find it?
22488,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"  You're scared, aren't you?  What are you scared of?  You didn't commit any crimes.  No one's going to hang you."
22489,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  Arya --
22490,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry?  No.  That's not Jon.  He'll understand.  You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
22491,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"  Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting?  This is exactly what she wants.  This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --"
22492,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"  The northern lords will read it.  They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.  What would little Lyanna Mormont say?  She's younger than you were when you wrote this.  Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
22493,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  You're angry.  Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
22494,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,  Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.  I'll go with anger.
22495,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  You’re the one they call the dog.
22496,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Fuck off.
22497,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  They told me you were mean.  Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?
22498,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  I don't give two shits about Wildlings.
22499,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Gingers I hate.
22500,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Gingers are beautiful.  We are kissed by fire.  Just like you.
22501,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Don't point your fucking finger at me.
22502,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
22503,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  I didn't trip.  I was pushed.
22504,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Ever since you've been mean.
22505,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Will you fuck off?
22506,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  I don't think you're truly mean.  You have sad eyes.
22507,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Do you want to suck my dick?  Is that it?
22508,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Dick?
22509,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Cock.
22510,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Ah.  Dick.  I like it.
22511,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  I bet you do.
22512,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Nope.  It's pussy for me.  I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell.  If I ever get back there.  Yellow hair.  Blue eyes.  Tallest woman you've ever seen.  Almost as tall as you.
22513,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Brienne of Tarth.
22514,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  You know her?
22515,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
22516,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,"  Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me."
22517,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  How does she look at you?  Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
22518,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  You do know her.
22519,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  We've met.
22520,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  I want to make babies with her.  Think of the great big monsters.  They'd conquer the world.
22521,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
22522,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  I'm good at killing people.
22523,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  You don't much look like him.
22524,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Who's that?
22525,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Your father.  I suppose you favor your mother.
22526,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  You knew him?
22527,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Of course I did.  When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain.  Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back.  Thoros has brought me back six times.  We both serve the same lord.
22528,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  I serve the north.
22529,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  The north didn't raise you from the dead.
22530,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  The lord of light never spoke to me.  I don't know anything about him.  I don't know what he wants from me.
22531,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  He wants you alive.
22532,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Why?
22533,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  I don't know.
22534,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,"  That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know.  So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
22535,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  I think about that all the time.  I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing.  We're soldiers.  We have to know what we're fighting for.  I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
22536,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  So what are you fighting for?
22537,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Life.  Death is the enemy.  The first enemy and the last.
22538,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  But we all die.
22539,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  The enemy always wins.  And we still need to fight him.  That's all I know.  You and I wont find much joy while we're here.  But we can keep others alive.  We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
22540,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,"  ""I am the shield that guards the realms of men."""
22541,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that.  Maybe that's enough.
22542,JON,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Aye.  Maybe that's enough.
22543,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  That's what I saw in the fire.
22544,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  A mountain like an arrowhead.
22545,THOROS,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  Are you sure?
22546,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,  We're getting close.
22547,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,  Do you know what I like about you?
22548,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,  I honestly don't.
22549,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,  You're not a hero.
22550,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,  Oh.  I've been heroic on occasion.
22551,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,  I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
22552,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"  I don't want you to be a hero.  Heroes do stupid things and they die.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."
22553,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"  It's interesting these heroes you name.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
22554,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,  Jon Snow's not in love with me.
22555,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"  Oh, my mistake.  I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."
22556,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, He's too little for me. I didn't mean
22557,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, As heroes go he is quite little.
22558,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, I know you're brave. I wouldn't have chosen a coward as my Hand.
22559,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11," So if all goes well, I'll finally get to meet your sister. From everything you've told me about her she'd rather murder me than speak with me."
22560,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11," Oh first she'd torture you in some horrible way, then she'd murder you. Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me. But if we go to the capital, we'll go with two armies, we'll go with three dragons, and anyone touches you, King's Landing burns down to the foundation stone."
22561,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, And right now she's thinking of how to set a trap.
22562,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, Of course she is. And she's wondering what trap you're laying for her.
22563,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, Are we? Laying any traps?
22564,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11," If we want to create a new and better world, I'm not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start."
22565,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?
22566,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11," Yes, you'll need to be ruthless if you're going to win the throne. You need to inspire a degree of fear. But fear is all Cersei has. It's all my father had, and Joffrey. It makes their power brittle. Because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead."
22567,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,  Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.
22568,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11," He did. But you once spoke to me of breaking the wheel. Aegon built the wheel. If that's the kind of queen you want to be, how are you different from all the other tyrants that came before you?"
22569,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,  So we walk into the lion's den?
22570,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, My brother promised me he'd keep a grip on the Lannister forces.
22571,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11," Forgive me, but I don't care about any Lannister promises. Except yours."
22572,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, And I promised him I'd keep you from doing anything impulsive.
22573,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, Impulsive?
22574,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, This will be a difficult negotiation. We're sitting down with people who want to see us both headless. My sister is likely to say something provocative.
22575,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, And?
22576,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, And you've been known to lose your temper from time to time. As all our great leaders do
22577,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, When have I lost my temper?
22578,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, Burning the Tarlys for instance.
22579,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, That was not impulsive. That was necessary.
22580,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, Perhaps.
22581,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,  Perhaps.
22582,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, Perhaps the father needed to die and not the son. Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate the mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell. We had no time to discuss the possibilities before you ended their possibilities.
22583,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, One can be forgiven for thinking you're taking your family's side in this debate.
22584,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11," I am taking their side. You need to take your enemy's side if you're going to see things the way they do. And you need to see things the way they do if you're going to anticipate their actions, respond effectively and beat them. Which I want you to do very much. Because I believe in you and the world you want to build. But the world you want to build doesn't get built all at once. Probably not in a single lifetime. How do we ensure your vision endures? After you break the wheel, how do we make sure it stays broken?"
22585,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11," You want to know who sits on the Iron Throne after I'm dead, is that it?"
22586,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11," You say you can't have children. But there are other ways of choosing a successor. The Night's Watch has one method, The Iron born folk, although many flaws"
22587,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.
22588,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11," Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows fly towards you when you fought on Blackwater Rush, and I saw hundred of arrows miss. But any one of them could have found your heart and end"
22589,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"  You've been thinking about my death quite a bit, haven't you? Is this one of the items you've discussed with your brother in King's Landing?"
22590,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11, I'm trying to serve you by planning for the long term.
22591,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11," Perhaps if you'd planned for the short term, we wouldn't have lost Dorne and Highgarden. We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown."
22592,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21, Look!
22593,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21, A  bear.
22594,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21, Big fucker.
22595,GENDRY,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21, Do bears have blue eyes?
22596,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21, We have to get him back to Eastwatch.
22597,THOROS,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21, (Shakes his head.) Flask.
22598,THOROS,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21, Go on.
22599,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21, You alright?
22600,THOROS,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21, I just got bit by a dead bear.
22601,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21, Aye. You did.
22602,THOROS,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21, Funny old life. Alright then.
22603,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,  Where did she get it?
22604,LITTLEFINGER,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,  I don't know. She seems very resourceful. You're worried.
22605,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1, We're asking 20 000 men to fight with us in the worst winter any of them have ever seen. The weather will be the least of their problems. Many of them will be happy to find a good reason to go home.
22606,LITTLEFINGER,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1, You question their loyalty?
22607,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1, Their loyalty is to JON SNOW. JON SNOW is not here. I haven't heard from him in weeks.
22608,LITTLEFINGER,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1, You're the Lady of Winterfell. The King chose you to rule in his absence. And rule you have. Wisely. Ably. They see that. They respect you. Some may even prefer you.
22609,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1," Yes, they turned their backs on JON SNOW when it was time to retake Winterfell and then they named him their king and now they're ready to turn their backs on him again. How far would you trust men like that? They're all bloody wind vanes. If they found out I wrote that letter a woman who's already married not one but two enemies of her House.  By the time JON SNOW comes back, he'll have no army left."
22610,LITTLEFINGER,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1," Arya is not like them. She's your sister. You may have disagreements, but she would never betray her family."
22611,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1, She would if she thought I was going to betray JON SNOW.
22612,LITTLEFINGER,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1, Is that what she thinks?
22613,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1, I don't know what she thinks. I don't know her anymore.
22614,LITTLEFINGER,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1, Perhaps Lady Brienne can help. She's sworn to protect both of Catelyn Stark's girls. Did she not?
22615,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1, She is.
22616,LITTLEFINGER,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1," And if one of you were planning to harm the other in any way, wouldn't she be honor bound to intercede?"
22617,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1, She would.
22618,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13, Something I've always wanted to know.
22619,THOROS,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13, Alright.
22620,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13, How drunk were you when you charged through the breach on Pyke?
22621,THOROS,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13," If I'm being honest, I don't remember charging through the breach. Some of the lads told me about it the next morning. Sounded like a good scrap."
22622,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13, Aye. It was a proper scrap. The Ironborn thought you were some kind of god. The way you were waving that flaming sword. I thought you were the bravest man I ever saw.
22623,THOROS,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13, Just the drunkest.
22624,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13, Where's the rest of them?
22625,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13, If we wait long enough we will find out.
22626,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13, (Nods)
22627,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13," Go back to Eastwatch. Get a raven to Daenerys, tell her what's happened."
22628,GENDRY,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13, I'm not leaving you.
22629,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,  You're the fastest. Go! Now!
22630,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13, You're faster without the hammer. Give it! Give it!
22631,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13, Come on! Run!
22632,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13, Come on!
22633,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13, Stop!
22634,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,  Go!
22635,DAVOS,7,66,beyond the wall,GENDRY running._3,  What happened? Where are the others?
22636,GENDRY,7,66,beyond the wall,GENDRY running._3, Raven. We need to send the raven.
22637,DAVOS,7,66,beyond the wall,GENDRY running._3, Get the maester! Now!
22638,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3, Thoros?
22639,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3, Thoros!
22640,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3, I say it's one of the better ways to go.
22641,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3," Lord of Light, show us the way. Come to us in our darkness and lead your servant into the light."
22642,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3, We have to burn this body.
22643,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3, And all the clothes behind him. Unless the Lord of Light is kind enough to send us a bit of fire.
22644,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3, Come to us in our darkness. For the night is dark and full of terrors.
22645,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3," We'll all freeze soon. I saw the water. When you killed the white walker, almost all the dead that followed it fell. Why?"
22646,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3, Maybe he was the one who turned them.
22647,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3, We can go for the walkers. Maybe we'll stand a chance.
22648,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,  No. We need to take that thing back with us. There's a raven flying for Dragonstone now. Daenerys is our only chance.
22649,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3, No. There's another.
22650,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3, Kill him. He turned them all.
22651,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3, You don't understand
22652,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3," The Lord brought you back he brought me back No one else, just us. Did he do it to watch us freeze to death?"
22653,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3," Careful, Beric, you've lost your priest. This is your last life."
22654,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3, I've been waiting for the end for a long time. Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it.
22655,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3, Every Lord I've ever met it's been a cunt. Can't see why the Lord of Light should be any different.
22656,WOLKAN,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1, My lady.
22657,WOLKAN,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1, My lady?
22658,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1, It's an invitation. To King's Landing.
22659,BRIENNE,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1," My lady, you are the Lady of Winterfell."
22660,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1," I am, and you will represent my interest at this gathering as you see them."
22661,BRIENNE,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1," They invited you, they want you there."
22662,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1," I will not set foot in King's Landing while Cersei Lannister is queen. They want another Stark prisoner, they can come and take me. Until then, I'll remain where I belong. I have work to do here."
22663,BRIENNE,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1, It's not safe.
22664,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1, Ser Jaime will be there. You said he treated you honourably before.
22665,BRIENNE,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,  I'm not worried about me. It's not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.
22666,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1, I have many guards who'd happily imprison him or behead him whether or not you're here.
22667,BRIENNE,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,  And you trust their loyalty? You trust he hasn't been speaking to them behind your back? Let me at least leave Podrick behind to watch over you. He has become a competent swordsman.
22668,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1," I do not need to be watched over or minded or cared for. I'm not a child, I am the Lady of Winterfell and I am home. This is the safest place for me."
22669,BRIENNE,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,  My lady. I sworn an oath to protect you and your sister. If I abandon you
22670,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1," The trip to King's Landing is long, Lady Brienne, and you won't be travelling on summer roads. The sooner you leave, the better your chances of making it on time."
22671,BRIENNE,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1," Yes, Milady."
22672,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior_1, You can't! The most important person in the world can't fly to the most dangerous place in the world.
22673,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior_1, Who else can?
22674,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior_1, No one. They knew the risk when they left. You can't win the throne if you're dead. You can't break the wheel if you're dead.
22675,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior_1,  So what would you have me do?
22676,TYRION,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior_1," Nothing. Sometimes nothing is the hardest thing to do. If you die we're all lost. Everyone, everything"
22677,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior_1, You told me to do nothing before and I've listened to you. I'm not doing nothing again.
22678,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1, Damn cunt.
22679,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1," Oh, fuck."
22680,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1, Fuck it!
22681,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1, Fall back! Fall back!
22682,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1, Come on!
22683,TORMUND,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1, No!
22684,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1, JON SNOW!
22685,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1, Go! Go now! Leave!
22686,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_3, Uncle Benjen! How?
22687,BENJEN,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_3, You ride for the pass.
22688,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_3, Come with me.
22689,BENJEN,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_3, It's not time. Go!
22690,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,"The Wall,  Northern Coast_1", (Nods)
22691,TORMUD,7,66,beyond the wall,"The Wall,  Northern Coast_1", (Nods)
22692,BERIC,7,66,beyond the wall,"The Wall,  Northern Coast_1"," We'll meet again, Clegane."
22693,SANDOR,7,66,beyond the wall,"The Wall,  Northern Coast_1", Fucking hope not.
22694,JORAH,7,66,beyond the wall,Top of the The Wall_1," It's time to go, Your Grace."
22695,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,Top of the The Wall_1, A bit longer.
22696,MAN,7,66,beyond the wall,Top of the The Wall_1, Rider approaching!
22697,MAN,7,66,beyond the wall,Top of the The Wall_1, Rider approaching!
22698,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3, Not what you're looking for?
22699,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3," (Gasps). I have hundreds of men here at Winterfell, all loyal to me."
22700,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3, They're not here now.
22701,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3, What are these?
22702,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3, My faces.
22703,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3, Where did you get them?
22704,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3," In Braavos, while I was training to be a faceless man."
22705,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3, What does that mean?
22706,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3," Back in Braavos, before I got my first face, there was I game I used to play. The game of faces. It's simple"
22707,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3, I don't want to play.
22708,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3, How do you feel about JON SNOW being king? Is there someone else you feel should rule the North instead of him?
22709,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3," Those faces, what are they?"
22710,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3, You want to do the asking? Are you sure? The game of faces didn't turn out so well for the last person who asked me questions.
22711,SANSA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3, Tell me what they are!
22712,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3," We both wanted to be other people when we were younger. You wanted to be a queen. To sit next to a handsome young king on the Iron Throne. I wanted to be a knight, to pick up a sword like father and go off to battle. Neither of us got to be the other person, did we? The world doesn't just let girls decide what they are going to be. But I can now. With the faces I can choose. I can become someone else. Speak in their voice, live in their skin. I can even become you."
22713,ARYA,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3, I wonder what it would feel like to wear those pretty dresses. To be the Lady of Winterfell. All I'd need to find out is your face.
22714,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1", I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
22715,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1", I wish I could take it back. I wish we'd never gone.
22716,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1", I don't. If we hadn't gone I wouldn't have seen. You have to see it to know. Now I know. The dragons are my children. They're the only children I'll ever have. Do you understand?
22717,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1", (Nods.)
22718,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1", We are going to destroy the Night King and his army. And we'll do it together. You have my word.
22719,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1"," Thank you, Dany."
22720,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1"," Dany? Who was the last person who called me that? I'm not sure, was it my brother? Not the company you want to keep."
22721,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1"," Alright. Not Dany. How about ""My Queen""? I'd bend the knee but..."
22722,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1", What about those who swore allegiance to you?
22723,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1", They'll all come to see you for what you are.
22724,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1", I hope I deserve it.
22725,JON SNOW,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1", You do.
22726,DAENERYS,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1", You should get some rest.
22727,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126, Oil?
22728,SOLDIER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126," Pitch, my lord."
22729,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126, How many barrels?
22730,SOLDIER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126," 500, my lord."
22731,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126, Get 500 more.
22732,SOLDIER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126,"  Yes, my lord."
22733,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126," I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord."""
22734,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126, The thrill will fade.
22735,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126, If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?
22736,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126, Gold?
22737,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126, I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
22738,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126, Family.
22739,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126," Not without a cock, you don't."
22740,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126, Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
22741,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126, Yet your brother chooses to side with the cockless.
22742,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126," Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden."
22743,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126, I think we're about to be the downtrodden.
22744,MAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126," Archers, stand tall!"
22745,MAN #2,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_126, Cover that wall!
22746,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1,  How many people live here?
22747,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1," A million, give or take."
22748,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1, That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
22749,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1, There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
22750,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1, Why isn't she with them?
22751,QYBURN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1," I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her."
22752,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1, And the rest of them?
22753,QYBURN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1, They're on their way to the dragon pit now.
22754,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1, Including our brother.
22755,QYBURN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1," Yes, Your Grace."
22756,MISSANDEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_128, Why did they build it?
22757,JORAH,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_128," Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem."
22758,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_128," I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world."
22759,DAVOS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_128, Maybe it still is.
22760,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_128," Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did."
22761,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_128, I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.
22762,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_128, A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.
22763,PODRICK,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_128," I never thought I'd see you again, my lord."
22764,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_128," Supporting the enemy, no less."
22765,PODRICK,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_128, Hard to blame you.
22766,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_128, Cersei will anyway.
22767,PODRICK,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_128, I'm glad you're alive.
22768,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_128, Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.
22769,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_128, (Shakes his head.)
22770,SOLDIER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, What's in there?
22771,SANDOR,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, Fuck off.
22772,BRIENNE,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, I thought you were dead.
22773,SANDOR,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, Not yet. You came pretty close.
22774,BRIENNE,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, I was only trying to protect her.
22775,SANDOR,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, You and me both.
22776,BRIENNE,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, She's alive. Arya.
22777,SANDOR,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, Where?
22778,BRIENNE,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, Winterfell.
22779,SANDOR,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, Who's protecting her if you're here?
22780,BRIENNE,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.
22781,SANDOR,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, It won't be me.
22782,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.
22783,PODRICK,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1," It is, my lord."
22784,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1," I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
22785,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, I'm sure your new queen will be happy to restore yours if she ends up on the throne.
22786,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1," You've been thinking about our new queen? Perhaps you’ve been reconsidering your allegiances. Remember my offer – whatever they’re paying you, I’ll pay double.”"
22787,VARYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1," And that would be double what now, exactly?"
22788,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
22789,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1," Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
22790,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1," I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
22791,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1, It's good to see you again.
22792,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1," Yeah, you, too."
22793,SANDOR,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside the Dragon PIt_1," Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first."
22794,BRONN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?"
22795,SANDOR,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?
22796,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, You might.
22797,SANDOR,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.
22798,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
22799,SANDOR,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother. You know who’s coming for you. You’ve always known."
22800,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Where is she?
22801,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, She'll be here soon.
22802,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Didn't travel with you?
22803,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, No.
22804,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, We've been here for some time.
22805,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, My apologies.
22806,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, We are all facing a unique--
22807,EURON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," Theon! I have your sister. If you don’t submit to me here, now… I’ll kill her."
22808,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
22809,EURON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.
22810,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes?
22811,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, His wasn't even good.
22812,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
22813,EURON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents."
22814,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Perhaps you ought to sit down.
22815,EURON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Why?
22816,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Sit down or leave.
22817,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face."
22818,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?"
22819,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, We all know that will never happen.
22820,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Then why are we here?
22821,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
22822,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
22823,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
22824,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce."
22825,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Yes. That's all.
22826,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
22827,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
22828,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, The word of a would-be usurper.
22829,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
22830,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,  We can destroy them by burning them.
22831,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world."
22832,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
22833,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.
22834,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, How many?
22835,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," A hundred thousand, at least."
22836,EURON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Can they swim?
22837,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, No.
22838,EURON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.
22839,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, What are you talking about?
22840,EURON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me."
22841,EURON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive."
22842,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."
22843,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, (SIGHS)
22844,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," In return, the King"
22845,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Just the King
22846,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," (CHUCKLES) I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son."
22847,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
22848,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.
22849,BRIENNE,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Ser Jaime.
22850,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
22851,BRIENNE,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.
22852,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother."
22853,BRIENNE,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," Oh, fuck loyalty!"
22854,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Fuck loyalty?
22855,BRIENNE,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.
22856,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, And tell her what?
22857,DAVOS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, I wish you hadn't done that.
22858,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing."
22859,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, I know!
22860,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen  I would have advised it, had you asked. But have you ever considered learning how to lie every now and then? Just a bit?"
22861,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father if you want, tell me that’s the attitude that got him killed. But when enough people make false promises, words stop meaning anything. Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies, and lies won’t help us in this fight."
22862,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
22863,DAVOS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
22864,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1," Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
22865,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, I didn't come all this way to have my Hand murdered.
22866,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
22867,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, I did this. I should go.
22868,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,  She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister alone. Or we all go home and we’re right back where we started.
22869,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1, (Nods)
22870,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing portico_1, You spoke with her?
22871,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing portico_1," At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
22872,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing portico_1," I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?"
22873,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing portico_1," I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another."
22874,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1," I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place."
22875,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1," A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you."
22876,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1," So you bring her here with her pet Northerner,  whom you've convinced to bow down before her."
22877,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,  I didn't know about that.
22878,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1," And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life."
22879,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"  Cersei, I didn't know."
22880,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, the destruction of this family.
22881,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
22882,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, You killed our father
22883,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1," After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me."
22884,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1," Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one would've touched them if Father was here, no one would have dared-"
22885,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,  I have never been more sorry about anything.
22886,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1," I will not hear it, not from you."
22887,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, (starts)
22888,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, I will not hear it!
22889,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1," All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me."
22890,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1," If it weren’t for me, you’d have a mother. If it weren’t for me, you’d have a father. If it weren’t for me, you’d have two beautiful children. I’ve thought about killing you more times than I can count. (turns to the MOUNTAIN) Do it! (turns back to Cersei) Say the word."
22891,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
22892,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, I will not
22893,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,  I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
22894,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.
22895,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1," If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?"
22896,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
22897,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1," Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something."
22898,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, What did you hope for?  To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.
22899,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1," Mm, not like this."
22900,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1," But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her."
22901,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, Yes.
22902,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, Why?
22903,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, Because I think she will make the world a better place.
22904,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
22905,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
22906,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.
22907,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1," That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter."
22908,TYRION,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1, You're pregnant.
22909,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1, No one is less happy about this than I am.
22910,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1," I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it."
22911,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1," This place was the beginning of the end for my family. (Speaks Valerian.) A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else."
22912,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1, You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
22913,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1, I can't have children.
22914,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1, Who told you that?
22915,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1, The witch who murdered my husband.
22916,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1, Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
22917,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1," You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
22918,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1," So, what now?"
22919,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1, I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
22920,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1, It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
22921,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1, (Laughs)
22922,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1," My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them."
22923,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
22924,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5," No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?"
22925,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
22926,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5," This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee."
22927,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
22928,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, What does that have to do with anything?
22929,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
22930,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, You think he wants to marry her?
22931,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5," An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King."
22932,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5," Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family."
22933,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5," You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?"
22934,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
22935,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5," Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men."
22936,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?
22937,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, She's your sister. You know her far better than I ever could.
22938,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.
22939,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, Why did she come to Winterfell?
22940,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
22941,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
22942,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.
22943,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5," And after she murders you, what does she become?"
22944,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5, Lady of Winterfell.
22945,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room_1," If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight."
22946,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room_1," And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell."
22947,JORAH,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room_1," Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror."
22948,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room_1," It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message."
22949,DAENERYS,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room_1, I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.
22950,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1, Jon.
22951,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1, Can I speak with you?
22952,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1, All right.
22953,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1," What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You could've lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth."
22954,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1, We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.
22955,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1," You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step."
22956,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1," It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret."
22957,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1," Not compared to me, you haven't."
22958,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1, No. Not compared to you.
22959,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1, I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.
22960,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1, Our father was more of a father to you than yours ever was.
22961,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1, He was.
22962,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1, And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.
22963,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1, I did.
22964,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1, (SIGHS) But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.
22965,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1, But the things I've done.
22966,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1," It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark."
22967,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1," When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. (SNIFFLES) She needs me now."
22968,JON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1," So, why are you still talking to me?"
22969,HARRAG,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1," Load up. Load up, lads. Go on. Tide's coming in."
22970,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1, All of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind.
22971,HARRAG,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1, Your sister’s dead.
22972,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,  She's not dead.
22973,HARRAG,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,"  She's dead. Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead."
22974,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1, She's our queen
22975,HARRAG,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1, She's your sister and you left her to die.
22976,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1, I did. I ran from my uncle. I was a coward.
22977,HARRAG,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1," So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves."
22978,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,  We're done with all that.
22979,HARRAG,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1, Who says we are?
22980,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1," Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free."
22981,HARRAG,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1," Run away, little Theon. It's what you do best."
22982,MAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1, He needs to shut his mouth.
22983,MAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1, Hey!
22984,MAN #2,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1," Oh, yes!"
22985,MAN #3,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1, That's more like it.
22986,HARRAG,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1, Stay down or I'll kill you!
22987,HARRAG,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1, (panting) I said stay down or I'll kill you!
22988,THEON,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1, Not for me. For Yara!
22989,MEN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1, Yara!
22990,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1, Have my sister
22991,ARYA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, Are you sure you want to do this?
22992,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.
22993,ARYA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, And what does honor demand?
22994,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.
22995,ARYA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," All right, then. Get on with it."
22996,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?
22997,ARYA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, My sister asked you a question.
22998,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused."
22999,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?"
23000,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, I did it to protect you.
23001,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon Arryn. You gave Lysa Tears of Lys to poison him. Do you deny it?"
23002,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," Whatever your aunt might have told you, she was a troubled woman. She imagined enemies everywhere."
23003,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn when, really, it was you. The conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters, it was you who started it. Do you deny it?"
23004,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, I know of no such letter.
23005,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father, Ned Stark. Thanks to your treachery, he was imprisoned and later executed on false charges of treason. Do you deny it?"
23006,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.
23007,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, You held a knife to his throat.
23008,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," You said, ""I did warn you not the trust me."""
23009,ARYA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," You told our mother this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister, but that was another one of your lies. It was yours."
23010,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you."
23011,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?
23012,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," If we could speak alone, I can explain everything."
23013,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother and Aunt Lysa and that’s what you tried to do to us."
23014,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," Sansa, please."
23015,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn."
23016,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.
23017,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, (Nods.)
23018,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, (to Yohn Royce) I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.
23019,YOHN ROYCE,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, I think not.
23020,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy."
23021,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," And yet, you betrayed her."
23022,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, I loved you. More than anyone.
23023,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," And yet, you betrayed me."
23024,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1," When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them."
23025,LITTLEFINGER,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1, Sansa! (GASPS) I--
23026,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.
23027,MAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, It'll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train.
23028,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell."
23029,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, Ser Jaime.
23030,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, Your Grace.
23031,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," My lords, I need a moment with my brother."
23032,MEN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, Your Grace.
23033,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, What are you doing?
23034,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, Preparing the expedition north.
23035,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?"
23036,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.
23037,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father? ? You expect me to command our troops to fight beside foreign scum, to fight for the Dragon Queen?"
23038,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.
23039,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," And I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?"
23040,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!"
23041,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen defend the North. We stay here where we’ve always been.
23042,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, I made a promise.
23043,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, Our child will rule Westeros.
23044,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, Our child will never be born if the dead come south.
23045,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us."
23046,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, And then what?
23047,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, And then we rule.
23048,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!"
23049,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.
23050,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.
23051,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, How many dragons did you see at the pit?
23052,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, Two.
23053,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, What happened to the third?
23054,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!"
23055,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable."
23056,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!
23057,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You should've listened more when Father spoke about the importance of gold. Oh, I know it’s boring for you. You just wanted to hunt and ride and fight. But I listened, I learned. Highgarden bought us the most powerful army in Essos, the Golden Company. Twenty thousand men, horses, elephants, I believe."
23058,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
23059,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen? No one walks away from me. He’s sailing with his fleet to Essos, he’s going to ferry the Golden Company back here to help us win the war for Westeros."
23060,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander of your armies?"
23061,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen."
23062,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, I didn't conspire with him.
23063,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.
23064,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.
23065,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, And that will be treason.
23066,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, Treason?
23067,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," Disobeying your queen's command, fighting with her enemies, what would you call it?"
23068,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, Doesn't matter what I'd call it.
23069,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, I told you no one walks away from me.
23070,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father is gone. It’s just me and you now."
23071,CERSEI,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,  There's one more yet to come.
23072,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1," Give the order, then."
23073,JAIME,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1, I  don't believe you.
23074,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, Come in.
23075,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, Samwell Tarly.
23076,SAM,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.
23077,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, I remember everything.
23078,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, You helped us get beyond the Wall. You're a good man.
23079,SAM,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1," Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?"
23080,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, I became the Three-Eyed Raven.
23081,SAM,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, Oh! I don't know what that means.
23082,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, I can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell?
23083,SAM,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1," Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him."
23084,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, He's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen.
23085,SAM,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1," You, you saw this  in a vision?"
23086,SAM,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, Oh.
23087,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, He needs to know the truth.
23088,SAM,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, The truth about what?
23089,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1," About himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt, Lyanna Stark. He was born in a tower in Dorne. His last name isn’t really Snow. It’s Sand."
23090,SAM,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, It's not.
23091,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, Dornish bastards are named Sand.
23092,SAM,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1," At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony."
23093,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1, Are you certain?
23094,SAM,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,  It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?
23095,RHAEGAR,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback_1,"  Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days."
23096,LYANNA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback_1," Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days."
23097,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback_1," Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie. Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt, or rape her."
23098,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Boat interior_1, He loved her. And she loved him.
23099,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback_3, And Jon -  Jon's real name.
23100,LYANNA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback_3," His name is Aegon Targaryen. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned."
23101,BRAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Boat Interior_1, He's never been a bastard-- he’s the heir to the Iron Throne.
23102,BRAN'S VOICE,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Boat Interior_1, He needs to know. We need to tell him.
23103,ARYA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3, Are you all right?
23104,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3," It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me."
23105,ARYA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3, You did the right thing.
23106,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3, You did it.
23107,ARYA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3, I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady of Winterfell.
23108,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3, Does that bother you?
23109,ARYA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3, I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.
23110,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3, You would have. You're the strongest person I know.
23111,ARYA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3, I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
23112,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3," Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying."
23113,ARYA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3," ""In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another."""
23114,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3," Father. ‘When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives."
23115,ARYA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3, I miss him.
23116,SANSA,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3," Me, too."
23117,BERIC,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Wall._1, It's a long way down.
23118,TORMUND,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Wall._1, Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.
23119,MAN,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Wall._1," I can see movement. Watch, on the tree line!"
23120,MAN #2,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Wall._1, What is it?
23121,TORMUND,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Wall._1, Come on!  Run! Run!
23122,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE_1, You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won’t freeze off.
23123,VARYS,8,68,winterfell,HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE_1," You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?"
23124,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE_1," Because I have balls, and you don't."
23125,JON,8,68,winterfell,HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE_1, I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
23126,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1, Look at you.
23127,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1, You're a man.
23128,BRAN,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1, Almost.
23129,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1, Where's Arya?
23130,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1, Lurking somewhere.
23131,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1," Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell."
23132,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1," Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you."
23133,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1," Winterfell is yours, Your Grace."
23134,BRAN,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1, We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.
23135,BRAN,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1," He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south."
23136,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1," As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?"
23137,UMBER,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1," We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady."
23138,UMBER,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1, And my lord.
23139,UMBER,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1, And my queen. Sorry.
23140,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1, You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.
23141,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1, We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.
23142,MAESTER WOLKAN,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1," At once, Your Grace."
23143,LYANNA MORMONT,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1," ""Your Grace."""
23144,LYANNA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1, But you’re not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I’m not sure what you are now.
23145,LYANNA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1, A lord? Nothing at all?
23146,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1, It's not important.
23147,LYANNA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1, Not important? We named you King in the North.
23148,MAN,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1, King of the North!
23149,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1," You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I’ll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North."
23150,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1," If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause."
23151,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1," I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die."
23152,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1," May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?"
23153,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1, Whatever they want.
23154,GENDRY,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15," Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it."
23155,MAN 1,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, Sorry ’bout that.
23156,GENDRY,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, Are these the last of the wagons?
23157,MAN 2,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, Aye.
23158,GENDRY,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15," All right, let's get it all to the forges."
23159,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, My lord. My lady.
23160,ROYCE,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, My lady.
23161,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.
23162,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15," So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose."
23163,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.
23164,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, It had its moments.
23165,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, Apologies for leaving like that.
23166,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15," Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder."
23167,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, We both survived.
23168,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.
23169,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15," I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-"
23170,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?
23171,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, She did.
23172,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, And you believed her?
23173,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
23174,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15, I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
23175,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, You used to be taller.
23176,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, How did you sneak up on me?
23177,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, How did you survive a knife through the heart?
23178,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, I didn't.
23179,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, You still have it.
23180,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, Needle.
23181,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, Have you ever used it?
23182,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, Once or twice.
23183,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, Valyrian steel.
23184,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, Jealous?
23185,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, Too heavy for me.
23186,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, Where were you before? I could've used your help with Sansa.
23187,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1," She doesn't like your queen, does she?"
23188,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
23189,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, She's the smartest person I've ever met.
23190,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, Now you're defending her?
23191,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, You?
23192,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, I'm defending our family. So is she.
23193,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, Yeah. I'm her family too.
23194,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, Don't forget that.EXT – KING'S LANDING - DAYPan down from a view of the Red Keep to see QYBURN walking up to CERSEI LANNISTER who stares out at the sea.
23195,QYBURN,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1," Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall."
23196,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1, Good.
23197,YARA,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1, Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?
23198,EURON,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1, But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.
23199,EURON,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1, If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?
23200,EURON,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1, I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.
23201,YARA,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1, Are we in King's Landing?
23202,EURON,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1, Mm.
23203,YARA,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1, You picked the losing side.
23204,EURON,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1, Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.
23205,EURON,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1, But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.
23206,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1," Twenty-thousand men, is it?"
23207,HARRY,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1," Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit."
23208,EURON,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1, They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.
23209,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1, Horses?
23210,HARRY,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1, Two thousand.
23211,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1, And elephants?
23212,HARRY,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1," Uh, no elephants, Your Grace."
23213,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1, That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.
23214,HARRY,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1," They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages."
23215,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1," In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland."
23216,HARRY,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1," We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace."
23217,EURON,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1, Am I most welcome here?
23218,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1, You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.
23219,EURON,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1, Good. As a true friend and an honored guest
23220,EURON,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1, I was hoping we could talk in private.
23221,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1, After the war. That was our agreement.
23222,EURON,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1, Wars sometimes last years.
23223,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1," You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her."
23224,EURON,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1, How?
23225,EURON,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1," I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken."
23226,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1, You're insolent. I've executed men for less.
23227,EURON,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1, They were lesser men.
23228,DIRAH,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.
23229,CRAYAH,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, Burnt up some of my favorite boys.
23230,DIRAH,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1," Archie, was it?"
23231,CRAYAH,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, And William.
23232,DIRAH,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, Tall handsome William?
23233,CRAYAH,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1," Yeah, tall handsome William."
23234,DIRAH,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.
23235,BRONN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.
23236,CRAYAH,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, Did you?
23237,BRONN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, Nearly killed it.
23238,MAREI,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, That's brave.
23239,CRAYAH,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, That boy Eddie.
23240,DIRAH,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, The ginger?
23241,CRAYAH,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.
23242,DIRAH,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, How does he sleep with no eyelids?
23243,BRONN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1," All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"
23244,QYBURN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
23245,BRONN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, You're kidding me.
23246,QYBURN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1," Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry."
23247,BRONN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1," Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps."
23248,CRAYAH,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.
23249,QYBURN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.
23250,BRONN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, Which girl?
23251,QYBURN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
23252,BRONN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1," She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them."
23253,QYBURN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1," That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside."
23254,BRONN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1," So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-"
23255,QYBURN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.
23256,BRONN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1," Yeah, well, good luck with that."
23257,QYBURN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-
23258,QYBURN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, She has a keen sense of poetic justice.
23259,BRONN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1, That fucking family.
23260,QYBURN,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1," When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?"
23261,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS_1, I wanted those elephants.
23262,EURON,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS_1," So, how do I compare to the fat king?"
23263,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS_1, You're insulting my late husband?
23264,EURON,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS_1, Are you offended?
23265,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS_1," Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body."
23266,EURON,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS_1, And the Kingslayer?
23267,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS_1," You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?"
23268,EURON,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS_1, Life is boring.
23269,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS_1," You're not boring, I'll give you that."
23270,EURON,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS_1, Do I please the queen?
23271,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS_1, You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.
23272,CERSEI,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS_1, But now I want to be alone.
23273,EURON,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS_1, I'm going to put a prince in your belly.
23274,YARA,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS_1," Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships."
23275,YARA,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS_1, We can take our home back.
23276,THEON,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS_1, Daenerys went north.
23277,YARA,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS_1, Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.
23278,THEON,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS_1, You're my queen. I go where you command.
23279,YARA,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS_1, You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.
23280,THEON,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS_1, What is dead may never die.
23281,YARA,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS_1, But kill the bastards anyway.EXT. WINTERFELL - DAYDAENERYS' army are camped outside the walls of Winterfell and wagons and horses enter the front gate.
23282,WOLKAN,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3," Welcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me"
23283,VARYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3, The Karstarks.
23284,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3," One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway."
23285,DAVOS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3, Can't argue with that.
23286,DAVOS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3," Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses."
23287,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3, And our queen is grateful.
23288,DAVOS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3," Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it."
23289,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3, I sense that you're leading to a proposal.
23290,DAVOS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3," A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?"
23291,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3, They do make a handsome couple.
23292,VARYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3, You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.
23293,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3, I'm not that old.
23294,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3, Not as old as him.
23295,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3, Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
23296,VARYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3," Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth."
23297,TYRION,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3, What is that?
23298,VARYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_3, Nothing lasts.
23299,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, Your sister doesn't like me.
23300,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1," She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up."
23301,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-
23302,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, How many today?
23303,DOTHRAKI MAN #1,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.
23304,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, What's the matter?
23305,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, The dragons are barely eating.
23306,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, What's wrong with them?
23307,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, They don't like the North.
23308,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, Go on.
23309,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, I don't know how to ride a dragon.
23310,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.
23311,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, What if he doesn't want me to?
23312,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1," Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow."
23313,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, What do I hold onto?
23314,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, Whatever you can.
23315,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, You've completely ruined horses for me.
23316,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, We could stay a thousand years-
23317,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, No one would find us.
23318,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, We'd be pretty old.
23319,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, It's cold up here for a southern girl.
23320,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, So keep your queen warm.
23321,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, Don't be afraid.

23323,MAN 1,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, Gendry?
23324,MAN 2,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, He's here.
23325,GENDRY,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.
23326,SANDOR,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1," You're saying you're good, is that it?"
23327,GENDRY,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-
23328,SANDOR,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, You know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers. Which one are you?
23329,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, Leave him be.
23330,SANDOR,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, I heard you were here. You left me to die.
23331,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, First I robbed you.
23332,SANDOR,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1," You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive."
23333,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.
23334,GENDRY,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1," Yeah, thanks. So have you."
23335,GENDRY,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1," I mean, you look good."
23336,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, Thanks. So do you.
23337,GENDRY,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1," It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold."
23338,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1," Stay close to that forge, then."
23339,GENDRY,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1," Is that a command, Lady Stark?"
23340,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, Don't call me that.
23341,GENDRY,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1," As you wish, milady."
23342,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, Here's my wish.
23343,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, Can you make it?
23344,GENDRY,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, What do you need something like this for?
23345,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, Can you make it or not?
23346,GENDRY,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, You already have a sword. What's that?
23347,GENDRY,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.
23348,ARYA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL_1, You don't know any other rich girls.
23349,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1, Come in.
23350,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1," Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men."
23351,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1," ""House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years."" Isn't that what he said?"
23352,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1," ""I will stand behind Jon Snow,"" he said."
23353,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1," ""The King in the North."""
23354,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1, I told you we needed allies.
23355,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1, You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.
23356,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1," I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons."
23357,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1, And a Targaryen queen.
23358,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1," Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance."
23359,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1, Do you have any faith in me at all?
23360,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1, You know I do.
23361,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1, She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.
23362,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1," No, she's much prettier."
23363,SANSA,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS_1, Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?
23364,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1, Oh!
23365,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1, So you're the man?
23366,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1," Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?"
23367,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1, The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.
23368,JORAH,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1," They could, they just wouldn't."
23369,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1, I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.
23370,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1," Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace."
23371,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1," Well, there must be something I could give you."
23372,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1," If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon."
23373,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1, For what crime?
23374,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1," Um, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel."
23375,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1, And also a sword.
23376,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1, From the Citadel?
23377,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1, From my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.
23378,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1," It would've been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas."
23379,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1, Not Randyll Tarly?
23380,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1, You know him?
23381,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1, I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.
23382,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1," Well At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord."
23383,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1, Your brother stood with your father.
23384,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1," Hm. Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me. And m- may I?"
23385,DAENERYS,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1, Of course.
23386,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_17, What are you doing out here?
23387,BRAN,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_17," Waiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth."
23388,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_17," No, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?"
23389,BRAN,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_17, I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.
23390,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, Sam?
23391,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1," I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here."
23392,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, Were you hiding from me?
23393,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, Of course not.
23394,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?
23395,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?
23396,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, She's good.
23397,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, Little Sam?
23398,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, Don't you know?
23399,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, Know what?
23400,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, Daenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.
23401,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, She didn't tell you.
23402,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.
23403,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, Would you have done it?
23404,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1," Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me."
23405,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, You've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.
23406,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, I wasn't a king.
23407,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, But you were. You've always been.
23408,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1," I gave up my crown, Sam."
23409,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.
23410,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, I'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.
23411,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, Bran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.
23412,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, What are you talking about?
23413,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, Your mother was Lyanna Stark.
23414,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1," And your father- your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen. You've never been a bastard. You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne. I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in."
23415,JON WALKS UP TO SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1,
23416,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.
23417,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1," No. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you. And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it."
23418,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, Daenerys is our queen.
23419,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, She shouldn't be.
23420,JON,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, That's treason.
23421,SAMWELL,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1," It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?EXT. LAST HEARTH - NIGHTBERIC DONDARRION and TORMUND with a group of others walk into Last Hearth to find it deserted. BERIC enters the building first, the others following cautiously behind. While exploring a dark hallway, a sudden noise startles the group and they press themselves against the walls, weapons drawn as the sounds turn into footprints. Suddenly, TORMUND leaps around the corner to confront the source of the noise with a roar, the rest of the group yelling in preparation to attack the enemy, but instead they find DOLOROUS EDD and others of the Night's Watch."
23422,EDD,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1," Stay back, he's got blue eyes!"
23423,TORMUND,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, I've always had blue eyes!
23424,BERIC,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, Did you find anyone?
23425,EDD,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, The Umber boy.
23426,BERIC,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, It's a message. From the Night King.
23427,TORMUND,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.
23428,EDD,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, We rode down from Castle Black. We can double up on the horses.
23429,TORMUND,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1," If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead."
23430,TORMUND,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - CRYPTS_1, We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-
23431,DAENERYS TARGARYEN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129," When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father."
23432,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.
23433,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.
23434,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, Your sister pledged to send her army north.
23435,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, She did.
23436,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129," I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me."
23437,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.
23438,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129," She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors."
23439,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129," ""We""?"
23440,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.
23441,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129," Your Grace, I know my brother-"
23442,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, Like you knew your sister?
23443,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129," He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?"
23444,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129," Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat."
23445,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129," You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours."
23446,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129," Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again."
23447,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, The things we do for love.
23448,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, So why have you abandoned your house and family now?
23449,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, Because this goes beyond loyalty.
23450,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, This is about survival.
23451,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129," You don't know me well, Your Grace."
23452,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129," But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it."
23453,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129," Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother."
23454,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, You vouch for him?
23455,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, I do.
23456,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, You would fight beside him?
23457,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, I would.
23458,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129," I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay."
23459,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, What does the Warden of the North say about it?
23460,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, We need every man we can get.
23461,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129, Very well.
23462,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_129," Thank you, Your Grace."
23463,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY_1," Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool."
23464,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY_1, I was a fool.
23465,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY_1, Not for the first time.
23466,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY_1," Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can."
23467,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY_1, I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.
23468,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, Don't you have something better to do?
23469,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, You make my weapon yet?
23470,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.
23471,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.
23472,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, It's strong enough.
23473,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1," It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know."
23474,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, Are you going to be down in the crypt?
23475,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1," No, but-"
23476,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, But you're a fighter.
23477,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, I've done my share.
23478,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, You've fought them?
23479,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, I did. Some of them.
23480,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, How many?
23481,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, A few. That was enough.
23482,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, What are they like?
23483,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, Bad. Really bad.
23484,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1," ""Really bad""?"
23485,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1," Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?"
23486,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1," Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-this is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like."
23487,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, I know Death.
23488,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, He's got many faces.
23489,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, I look forward to seeing this one.
23490,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, My weapon?
23491,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1, I'll get right on it.
23492,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3, I'm sorry for what I did to you.
23493,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3, You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.
23494,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3, I'm not that person anymore.
23495,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3," You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark."
23496,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3, You're not?
23497,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3, No. I'm something else now.
23498,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3, You're not angry at me.
23499,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3, I'm not angry at anyone.
23500,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3, Why didn't you tell them?
23501,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3, You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.
23502,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3, What about afterwards?
23503,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3, How do you know there is an afterwards?
23504,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19," Well, here we are."
23505,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19," Yes, here we are."
23506,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, Together again.
23507,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, And the masses rejoice.
23508,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, How do they feel about their new queen?
23509,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, She's your new queen too.
23510,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.
23511,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, And she is? Different?
23512,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, She is.
23513,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, You're sure about her?
23514,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, I am.
23515,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, She didn't seem sure about you.
23516,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
23517,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, Hmm.
23518,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
23519,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, Was she lying about the baby too?
23520,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19," No, that part is real."
23521,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.
23522,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, What?
23523,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19," She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."
23524,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19," So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I would've chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-"
23525,BOTH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, A girl's mouth around-
23526,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, Your cock.
23527,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, My cock.
23528,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
23529,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19, Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.
23530,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, Ser Jaime.
23531,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, Lady Brienne.
23532,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, He's come a long way.
23533,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, He's alright. Still has a lot to learn.
23534,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.
23535,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1," I am. It's, uh-it's good ground."
23536,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, It is.
23537,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1," The rise, it should give us some advantage."
23538,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1," If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back."
23539,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1," Yes, I think you're right."
23540,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, What are you doing?
23541,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, What?
23542,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, I think you know.
23543,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, I truly don't.
23544,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.
23545,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, You want me to insult you?
23546,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, No!
23547,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, Good.
23548,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1," I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me."
23549,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1, I better get back.
23550,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1," Forgive me, khaleesi."
23551,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1, Have you done something to offend me?
23552,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1, Many things.
23553,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1, Long ago and long forgiven.
23554,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1," But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart."
23555,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1," When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again."
23556,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1, You made the right choice.
23557,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1, I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
23558,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1, I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
23559,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1, But the mind behind all those words-
23560,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1, He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.
23561,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1, As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.
23562,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1, You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?
23563,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1," I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me."
23564,ROYCE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3," The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates."
23565,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.
23566,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3," Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone."
23567,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.
23568,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3," Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone."
23569,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
23570,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.
23571,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
23572,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3," I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei."
23573,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, You never should have either.
23574,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, I thought he knew his sister.
23575,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, Families are complicated.
23576,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, Ours certainly have been.
23577,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, A sad thing to have in common.
23578,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3," We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell."
23579,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3," And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother."
23580,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3," He loves you, you know that."
23581,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, That bothers you.
23582,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.
23583,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3," All my life, I've known one goal"
23584,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.
23585,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3," I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about."
23586,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, Who was the first?
23587,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, Someone taller.
23588,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3," And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?"
23589,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, I take the Iron Throne.
23590,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3," What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?"
23591,WOLKAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3," Apologies, my lady. Your Grace."
23592,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3, What is it?
23593,THEON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1, My queen.
23594,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1, Your sister?
23595,THEON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1," She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name."
23596,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1, But why aren't you with her?
23597,THEON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1," I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me."
23598,MAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1," Milord, we're not soldiers."
23599,DAVOS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1," You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way."
23600,MAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, Thank you.
23601,GILLY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1," When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts."
23602,GILLY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, They're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.
23603,WOMAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, Thank you.
23604,TEELA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, Which way should I go?
23605,DAVOS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, Which way do you want to go?
23606,TEELA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, All the children will be going below when the time comes.
23607,TEELA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, But both me brothers were soldiers. I want to fight too.
23608,GILLY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1," That's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us."
23609,DAVOS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, I'm sure a lot of people would.
23610,TEELA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1," All right. I'll defend the crypt, then."
23611,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, My little crow.
23612,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, I thought we'd lost you.
23613,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, Almost.
23614,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, How did you find each other?
23615,EDD,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, We met up at the Last Hearth.
23616,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, The dead got there first.
23617,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, The Umbers?
23618,BERIC,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, Fighting for the Night King now.
23619,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, We had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.
23620,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, How long do we have?
23621,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, Before the sun comes up tomorrow.
23622,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, The big woman still here?EXT. WINTERFELL - DAYCUT TO
23623,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1, They're coming.
23624,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_21, We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.
23625,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_3, But there are too many of them.
23626,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – BATTLEMENTS_1, Far too many.
23627,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_5, Our enemy doesn't tire.
23628,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_5, Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.
23629,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, We can't beat them in a straight fight.
23630,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5," So, what can we do?"
23631,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.
23632,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5," If that's true, he'll never expose himself."
23633,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5," Yes, he will."
23634,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5," He'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens."
23635,SAMWELL,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, Why? What does he want?
23636,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5," An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory."
23637,SAMWELL,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5," That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you."
23638,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, How will he find you?
23639,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, His mark is on me.
23640,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, He always knows where I am.
23641,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5," We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest."
23642,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, No. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait for him in the Godswood.
23643,SANSA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, You want us to use you as bait?
23644,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, We're not leaving you alone out there.
23645,THEON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, He won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. (to Bran) I took this castle from you. Let me defend you now.
23646,DAVOS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.
23647,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5," When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench."
23648,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.
23649,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5," Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives."
23650,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5," There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it."
23651,DAVOS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, The dragons should give us an edge in the field.
23652,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5," If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does."
23653,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, Dragonfire will stop him?
23654,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, I don't know. No one's ever tried.
23655,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, We're all going to die.
23656,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, But at least we die together.
23657,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, Let's get some rest.
23658,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, Your Grace.
23659,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, Do you need help?
23660,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, No.
23661,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, You've had a strange journey.
23662,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, Stranger than most.
23663,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, I'd like to hear about it.
23664,BRAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5, It's a long story.
23665,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_5," If only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go."
23666,MISSANDEI,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, Hello.
23667,GREY WORM,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23," When Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here. I am loyal to my queen. I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is over and she has won, do you want to grow old in this place? Is there nothing else you want to do, nothing else you want to see?"
23668,MISSANDEI,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, Naath. I'd like to see the beaches again.
23669,GREY WORM,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, Then I will take you there.
23670,MISSANDEI,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, My people are peaceful. We cannot protect ourselves.
23671,GREY WORM,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, My people are not peaceful. We will protect you.EXT. WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO
23672,SAMWELL,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, Have you told her yet?
23673,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, No.
23674,SAMWELL,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, Mm-hmm. Being careful. Biding your time. Waiting for the perfect-
23675,EDD,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, And now our watch begins.
23676,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, Gilly? Little Sam?
23677,SAMWELL,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, They'll be safe down in the crypt.
23678,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, If you want to join them.
23679,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, To protect them.
23680,SAMWELL,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed Thenns.
23681,EDD,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, Thenn.
23682,SAMWELL,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23," I've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there."
23683,EDD,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23," Well, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked."
23684,SAMWELL,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23," Well, calling you ""fucked"" wouldn't be strictly accurate."
23685,EDD,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, Samwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more signs the world was ending.
23686,SAMWELL,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23," Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp."
23687,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23, Now it's just us three.
23688,EDD,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_23," Last man left, burn the rest of us."
23689,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, I wish Father were here.
23690,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.
23691,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, That would be something to see.
23692,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3," I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall."
23693,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, Mm.
23694,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.
23695,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.
23696,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, I was speaking in relative terms.
23697,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, Do you miss it?
23698,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, Of course I miss it.
23699,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3," Well, my golden lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you."
23700,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, It's not. Things would be easier if it were.
23701,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, The perils of self-betterment.
23702,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, Oh! My lady.
23703,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3," Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-"
23704,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.
23705,PODRICK,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3," Thank you, milord."
23706,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, I don't think that's wise.
23707,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, The battle might start at any moment.
23708,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, Half cup.
23709,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, And you?
23710,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3," No, thank you. I should try and get some sleep."
23711,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.
23712,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, All right. Just a bit.
23713,DAVOS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3," Well, what do we have here?"
23714,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3," Ser Davos, join us."
23715,DAVOS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3," No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this."
23716,DAVOS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.
23717,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3," It could be our last night in this world, you know."
23718,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3," Yes, well, I'm glad you're here."
23719,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.
23720,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, Would you like a drink?
23721,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, Brought my own.
23722,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3," They call you ""King Killer."""
23723,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, I'm sure someone does.
23724,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3," They call me ""Giantsbane."" Want to know why?"
23725,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, I killed a giant when I was ten. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.
23726,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3," When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk."
23727,DAVOS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_3, Maybe I will have that drink.
23728,SANDOR,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1, You never used to shut up. Now you're just sitting there like a mute.
23729,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1, Guess I've changed.
23730,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1, What are you doing up here?
23731,SANDOR,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1, What's it look like?
23732,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1," No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?"
23733,SANDOR,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1," I fought for you, didn't I?"
23734,SANDOR,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1," Oh, for fuck's sake. May as well be at a bloody wedding."
23735,BERIC,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1, My lady. It's good to see you again. I'm sorry we parted the way we did.
23736,SANDOR,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1, Was he on your list?
23737,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1, For a little while.
23738,BERIC,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1, That's all right.
23739,BERIC,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1, The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same. This is his moment. When light-
23740,SANDOR,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1," Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon. Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back nineteen times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall."
23741,SANDOR,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1, Where are you going?
23742,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1, I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.
23743,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, That for me?
23744,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, This'll work.
23745,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3," Last time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell. Took the long road, but…"
23746,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, What did the Red Woman want with you?
23747,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.
23748,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, Why your blood?
23749,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.
23750,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3," I didn't know until she told me. Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me."
23751,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, Was that your first time?
23752,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3," No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock."
23753,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, Your first time with a woman.
23754,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, What? I-I didn't-I wasn't with her.
23755,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?
23756,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, Or after?
23757,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, You don't remember?
23758,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3," Yes, I was."
23759,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, One? Two? Twenty?
23760,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3," Well, I didn't keep count."
23761,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3," Yes, you did."
23762,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, Three.
23763,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.
23764,GENDRY,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3," Arya, I-"
23765,ARYA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_3, I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.
23766,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5," It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together."
23767,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, At least we'll die with honor.
23768,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, I think we might live.
23769,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.
23770,DAVOS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, All without a shred of combat ability.
23771,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5," Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke."
23772,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.
23773,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5," Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne."
23774,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, She's not a ser? You're not a knight?
23775,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, Women can't be knights.
23776,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, Why not?
23777,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, Tradition.
23778,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, Fuck tradition.
23779,BRIENNE,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, I don't even want to be a knight.
23780,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5," I'm no king. But if I were, I'd knight you ten times over."
23781,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.
23782,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, I'll prove it.
23783,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5," Kneel, Lady Brienne."
23784,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.
23785,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5," In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave."
23786,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5," In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just."
23787,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5," In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent."
23788,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5," Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms."
23789,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_5, Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!
23790,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_3, We have all we need to win this war.
23791,LYANNA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_3," I have trained my men, women and children. I have fought before. I can fight again."
23792,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_3," Please, listen to me. You're the future of our house."
23793,LYANNA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_3, I don't need you to remind me of that.
23794,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_3, You'll be safer in the crypt. These things we're fighting-
23795,LYANNA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_25," I will not hide underground. I pledged to fight for the North, and I will fight."
23796,SAMWELL,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_25," Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-"
23797,LYANNA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_25, It's all right. We're done here.
23798,LYANNA,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_25," I wish you good fortune, cousin."
23799,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_25," Thank you, my lady."
23800,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_25, What have you got there?
23801,SAMWELL,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_25, It's called Heartsbane. It's my family sword.
23802,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_25, You still have a family.
23803,SAMWELL,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_25," Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it. But I can't really hold it upright. Your father, he taught me how to be a man. How to do what's right. This is right. It's Valyrian steel. I'd be honored if you'd take it."
23804,JORAH,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_25, I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.
23805,SAMWELL,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_25, I'll see you when it's through.
23806,SAMWELL,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_25, I hope we win.
23807,JAIME,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_7, We'd better get some rest.
23808,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_7," No, let's stay a bit longer."
23809,DAVOS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_7, We're out of wine.
23810,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_7, How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?
23811,DAVOS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_7, You'll pray for a quick death.
23812,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_7, Ser Brienne?
23813,TORMUND,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_7, Mm-mm.
23814,TYRION,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_7, Mmm.
23815,PODRICK,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_7," High in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts, the ones she had lost and the ones she had found and the ones who had loved her the most."
23816,PODRICK,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – SAMWELL’S QUARTERS_1, The ones who'd been gone for so very long.
23817,PODRICK,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_27, She couldn't remember their names. They spun her around on the damp old stones.
23818,PODRICK,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_5, Spun away all her sorrow and pain. And she never wanted to leave
23819,PODRICK,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_29, Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.
23820,PODRICK,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5, Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.INT. WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO
23821,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5, Who's that?
23822,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5, Lyanna Stark.
23823,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5," My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her."
23824,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5, He didn't. He loved her.
23825,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5," They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard."
23826,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5, My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.
23827,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5, That's impossible.
23828,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5, I wish it were.
23829,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5, Who told you this?
23830,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5, Bran. He saw it.
23831,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5, He saw it?
23832,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5, And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.
23833,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5, A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?
23834,JON,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5," It's true, Dany. I know it is."
23835,DAENERYS,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_5," If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne."
23836,MAN,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_5, Form up! Get yourselves back!
23837,NORTHMAN 1,8,70,the long night,Unnamed Scene_130, Oi!

23862,MELISANDRE,8,70,the long night,WALKWAY_1," There's no need to execute me, Ser Davos. I'll be dead before the dawn."
23863,SOLDIER,8,70,the long night,OUTSIDE THE WALLS_9, (in Dothraki) Cease fire!
23864,JON,8,70,the long night,A NEARBY MOUNTAINTOP_7, The Night King is coming.

23870,SANSA,8,70,the long night,THE RAMPARTS_17, I'm not abandoning my people.
23871,ARYA,8,70,the long night,THE RAMPARTS_17, Take this and go.
23872,SANSA,8,70,the long night,THE RAMPARTS_17, I don't know how to use it.
23873,ARYA,8,70,the long night,THE RAMPARTS_17, Stick them with the pointy end.
23874,SAMWELL,8,70,the long night,THE BATTLE_7, Edd! Edd!
23875,EDD,8,70,the long night,THE BATTLE_7," Sam, get up!"

23924,BERIC,8,70,the long night,THE TRENCH_1, Clegane.
23925,WOMAN,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3, You must try not to worry yourself.
23926,VARYS,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3, (Sighs.) At least we're already in a crypt.
23927,TYRION,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3," If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference."
23928,VARYS,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3, (Scoffs.)
23929,TYRION,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3,  What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.
23930,VARYS,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3, And got your face cut in half.
23931,TYRION,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3, And it made a difference. If I was out there right now...
23932,SANSA,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3, You'd die. There's nothing you can do.
23933,TYRION,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3, You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.
23934,SANSA,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3," Witty remarks won't make a difference. That's why we're down here, none of us can do anything. It's the truth. It's the most heroic thing we can do now look the truth in the face."
23935,TYRION,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3, Maybe we should have stayed married.
23936,SANSA,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3, You were the best of them.
23937,TYRION,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3, What a terrifying thought.
23938,SANSA,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3, It wouldn't work between us.
23939,TYRION,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3, Why not?
23940,SANSA,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3, The Dragon Queen. Your divided loyalties would become a problem.
23941,MISSANDEI,8,70,the long night,THE CRYPT_3," Yes. Without the Dragon Queen, there'd be no problem at all. We'd all be dead already."
23942,THEON,8,70,the long night,THE GODSWOOD_5,  They lit the trench. Bran I just want you to know... I wish... The things I did
23943,BRAN,8,70,the long night,THE GODSWOOD_5, Everything you did brought you where you are now. Where you belong. Home.
23944,BRAN,8,70,the long night,THE GODSWOOD_5, I'm going to go now.

24015,BRAN,8,70,the long night,THE GODSWOOD_17, Thank you.
24016,JORAH,8,70,the long night,THE FIELD_13, I'm hurt.
24017,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,Unnamed Scene_131, We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.

24019,MAN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1, To your health.
24020,GENDRY,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1, Have you seen Arya?
24021,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1," You can still smell the burning bodies, and that’s where your head is at."
24022,GENDRY,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1, I just want to thank her for-
24023,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1, I'm sure you do.
24024,GENDRY,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1," Look, it's not about that."
24025,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1," Of course it's about that, you twat. Why shouldn't it be? The dead are dead. You're not."
24026,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1, Gendry.
24027,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1," That's right, isn't it?"
24028,GENDRY,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1," Yes, Your Grace."
24029,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1, You’re Robert Baratheon’s son.
24030,GENDRY,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1, (nods)
24031,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1, You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?
24032,GENDRY,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1, I didn’t even know he was my father until after he was dead.
24033,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1," Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?"
24034,GENDRY,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1," I don’t know, Your Grace."
24035,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1, Does anyone?
24036,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1,I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.
24037,GENDRY,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1, I can't be. I'm a bastard.
24038,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1," No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you."
24039,DAVOS,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1, To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.
24040,ALL,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1, To Gendry!

24051,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1,  See? You're not the only one who's clever.
24052,WOMAN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL GREAT HALL_1, I have to go down and get another barrel.
24053,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GREAT HALL, LATER_1"," We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?"
24054,DAVOS,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1," The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again."
24055,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1,  I'm sure you had your reasons.
24056,DAVOS,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1,  I did. I do.
24057,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1,   So did you?
24058,DAVOS,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1," Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?"
24059,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1,  I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.
24060,DAVOS,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1, And what if I'm not trying to be happy?
24061,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1," Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with."
24062,DAVOS,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1,  Thank you. I feel much better.
24063,MAN,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1, More ale!
24064,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1, This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.
24065,BRAN,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1, It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one.
24066,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1, You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.
24067,BRAN,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1, I'm not Lord of Winterfell.
24068,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1, You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.
24069,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1, You don't want it.
24070,BRAN,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1, I don't really want anymore.
24071,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1, I envy you.
24072,BRAN,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1, You shouldn't envy me. Mostly I live in the past.

24074,MAN,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_7, Go on.

24076,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_7, Go on. I believe in you.
24077,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_7, We have to celebrate our victory.
24078,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_7, Vomiting is not celebrating.
24079,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_7," Yes, it is."
24080,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_7, Ah! To the Dragon Queen!
24081,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_7," To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!"

24087,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,A NEARBY TABLE_1, I told you I was.
24088,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,A NEARBY TABLE_1,  You didn't.
24089,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,A NEARBY TABLE_1, I did.
24090,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,A NEARBY TABLE_1, I surmised it.
24091,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,A NEARBY TABLE_1, Drink.
24092,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,A NEARBY TABLE_1, Go again.
24093,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,A NEARBY TABLE_1, Why does he get to go again?
24094,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,A NEARBY TABLE_1, Because it's my game.
24095,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,A NEARBY TABLE_1, You have danced with Renly Baratheon.
24096,PODRICK,8,71,the last of the starks,A NEARBY TABLE_1, (to Brienne) No.
24097,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,A NEARBY TABLE_1, Drink.
24098,MAN,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9, The other way around!
24099,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9, I saw him riding that thing.
24100,DAVOS,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9,  We all did.
24101,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9,  No. No. I saw him riding that thing.
24102,DAVOS,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9,"  That's right, you did."
24103,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9, I did. That's why we all agreed to follow him. That's the kind of man he is.
24104,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9, (laughing) He's little but he's strong. Strong enough to befriend an enemy and get murdered for it!
24105,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9," Most people get bloody murdered, they stay that way."
24106,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9, Not this one.
24107,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9," Yeah, I didn't have much say in that."
24108,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9," Ah! He comes back and keeps fighting. Here, north of the Wall, and then back here again. He keeps fighting. He keeps fighting."
24109,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9, He climbed on a fucking dragon and fought. What kind of person climbs on a fucking dragon? A madman or a king!

24119,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,THE DRINKING GAME_1, You're a virgin.
24120,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,THE DRINKING GAME_1, That's a statement about the present.
24121,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,THE DRINKING GAME_1," At no point in the past, up until this very moment, have you slept with a man. Or a woman."
24122,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,THE DRINKING GAME_1, I have to piss.
24123,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,THE DRINKING GAME_1," We did it! We faced those icy fucks. Looked right into their blue eyes, and here we are. Now, which one of you cowards shit in my pants?"

24128,WILLA,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1", You can touch me.
24129,WILLA,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1", I'm not afraid of wildlings.
24130,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1", Maybe you should be.

24139,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1"," She could have made you happy, for a little while."
24140,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1", There's only one thing that'll make me happy.
24141,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1", And what's that?
24142,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1", That's my fucking business.

24144,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1", That was a long time ago. I've seen much worse than you since then.
24145,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1"," Yes, I've heard. Heard you were broken in. Heard you were broken in rough."
24146,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1", And he got what he deserved. I gave it to him.
24147,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1", How?
24148,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1", Hounds.
24149,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1"," You've changed, Little Bird."
24150,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1"," None of it would have happened if you'd left King's Landing with me. No Littlefinger, no Ramsay none of it."
24151,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1"," Without Littlefinger and Ramsay and the rest, I would have stayed a Little Bird all my life."
24152,MAN 1,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_11, Hey!
24153,MAN 2,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_11, Pour another one.
24154,GENDRY,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_11, Don't shoot.
24155,GENDRY,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_11," It's nighttime, it's freezing, and everyone's celebrating. You should be celebrating with them."
24156,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_11, I am celebrating.
24157,GENDRY,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_11," Yeah, I am too. I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore. I'm Gendry Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End. By order of the queen."
24158,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_11, Congratulations.
24159,GENDRY,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_11," I don't know how to be lord of anything. I hardly know how to use a fork. All I know is that you're beautiful, and I love you, and none of it will be worth anything if you're not with me. So be with me."
24160,GENDRY,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_11, Be my wife. Be the Lady of Storm's End.
24161,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_11," You'll be a wonderful lord, and any lady would be lucky to have you. But I'm not a lady. I never have been. That's not me."
24162,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", You didn't drink.
24163,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I didn't drink?
24164,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", In the game.
24165,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",  I drank.
24166,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", In the game. This is Dornish.
24167,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",  This is not the game. This is only drinking.
24168,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Suit yourself.
24169,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", You keep it warm enough in here.
24170,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," It's the first thing I learnt when I came to the North. Keep your fire going. Every time you leave the room, put more wood on."
24171,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", That's very diligent. Very responsible.
24172,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Piss off.
24173,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", You know the first thing I learned in the North? I hate the fucking North.
24174,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", It grows on you.
24175,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I don't want things growing on me.
24176,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", How about Tormund Giantsbane? Has he grown on you? He was very sad when you left.
24177,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", (almost whispering) You sound quite jealous.
24178,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," (nods) I do, don't I? It's bloody hot in here."
24179,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," Oh, move aside."
24180,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",  What are you doing?
24181,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I'm taking your shirt off.
24182,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I've never slept with a knight before.
24183,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I've never slept with anyone before.
24184,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Then you have to drink. Those are the rules.
24185,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,"BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I told you-
24186,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Are you drunk?
24187,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", No.
24188,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Only a little.
24189,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," I didn't know Ser Jorah well but I know this. If he could have chosen a way to die, it would have been protecting you."
24190,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", He loved me. And I couldn't love him back. Not the way he wanted. Not the way I love you.
24191,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Is that all right?
24192,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," I wish you'd never told me. If I didn't know, I'd be happy right now."
24193,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," I try to forget. Tonight I did for a while, and then I saw them gathered around you. I saw the way they looked at you. I know that look. So many people have looked at me that way, but never here. Never on this side of the sea."
24194,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I told you I don't want it.
24195,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," (angrily) It doesn't matter what you want. You didn't want to be King in the North. What happens when they demand you press your claim, and take what is mine?"
24196,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I'll refuse. You are my queen. I don't know what else I can say.
24197,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," (desperately) You can say nothing. To anyone, ever. Never tell them who you really are. Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly to secrecy, and tell no one else. Or it will take on a life of its own and you won't be able to control it or what it does to people. No matter how many times you bend the knee, no matter what you swear."
24198,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I want it to be the way it was between us.
24199,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I have to tell Sansa and Arya.
24200,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Sansa will want to see me gone and you on the Iron Throne.
24201,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", She won't.
24202,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1"," She's not the girl you grew up with. Not after what she's seen, not after what they've done to her."
24203,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", I owe them the truth.
24204,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", Even if the truth destroys us?
24205,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", It won't.
24206,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", It will. I've never begged for anything but I'm begging you. Don't do this. Please.
24207,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", You are my queen. Nothing will change that. And they are my family. We can live together.
24208,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1", We can. I've just told you how.
24209,GREY WORM,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1",  Half are gone.
24210,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1", The Northmen as well.
24211,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1"," And the Golden Company has arrived in King's Landing, courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet. The balance has grown distressingly even."
24212,MISSANDEI,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1"," When the people find out what we have done for them, that we saved them-"
24213,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1", Cersei will make sure they don't believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem.
24214,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1", The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.
24215,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1"," Thankfully, she's losing allies by the day. Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands in her queen's name. The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support."
24216,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1"," No matter how many lords turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne, she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. We need the capital."
24217,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1"," I watched the people of King's Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry, and that was before winter began. Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside."
24218,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1"," We'll surround the city. If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food, the dragons will destroy them. If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack, we'll defeat them in the field."
24219,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1"," Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over."
24220,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1", All right.
24221,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1", The men we have left are exhausted. Many of them are wounded. They'll fight better if they have time to rest and recuperate.
24222,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1", How long do you suggest?
24223,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1"," I can't say for certain, not without talking to the officers."
24224,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1"," I came north to fight alongside you at great cost to my armies and myself. Now that the time has come to reciprocate, you want to postpone."
24225,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1", It's not just our people. It's yours. You want to throw them into a war they're not ready to fight?
24226,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1"," The longer I leave my enemies alone, the stronger they become."
24227,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1", (to SANSA and ARYA) The Northern forces will honor their promises and their allegiance to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
24228,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1"," What you command, we will obey."
24229,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1", So if all are in agreement Jon and Ser Davos will ride down the Kingsroad with the Northern troops and the bulk of the remaining Dothraki and Unsullied.
24230,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1"," A smaller group of us will ride to White Harbor, and sail from there to Dragonstone with our queen and her dragons accompanying us from above."
24231,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1"," Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here, as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell."
24232,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1"," We have won the Great War. Now we will win the Last War. In all Seven Kingdoms, men will live without fear and cruelty under their rightful queen."
24233,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY_1", We need a word.
24234,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", You understand we'd all be dead if not for her. We'd be corpses marching down to King's Landing.
24235,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", Arya's the one that killed the Night King.
24236,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", Her men gave their lives defending Winterfell-
24237,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", And we will never forget them. That doesn't mean that I want to kneel to someone who-
24238,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", I swore myself and the North to her cause.
24239,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", I respect that.
24240,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", You respect it?
24241,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1"," We needed her. We needed her army, her dragons. You did the right thing. And we're doing the right thing telling you we don't trust your queen."
24242,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1",  You don't know her yet.
24243,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1",  I'll never know her. She's not one of us.
24244,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1"," If you only trust the people you grew up with, you won't make many allies."
24245,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", That's all right. I don't need many allies.
24246,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", Arya-
24247,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", We're family. The four of us. The last of the Starks.
24248,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", I've never been a Stark.
24249,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", You are. You're just as much Ned Stark's child as any of us.
24250,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", You're my brother. Not my half-brother or my bastard brother. My brother.
24251,BRAN,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", It's your choice.
24252,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", I need to tell you something. But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.
24253,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", What is it?
24254,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1"," You have to swear it, before I tell you."
24255,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", How can I promise to keep a secret if I don't even know what it is?
24256,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", Because we're family. Swear it.
24257,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", I swear it.
24258,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", I swear it.
24259,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY_1", (to BRAN) Tell them.
24260,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, So she's going to stay here with you?
24261,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so... Say something snide."
24262,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, I'm happy. I'm happy that you're happy. I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb for it.
24263,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, Do you know how long I've waited to tell tall person jokes? To climbing mountains.
24264,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, To climbing mountains.
24265,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, What's she like down there?
24266,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, What? That's not your concern.
24267,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, I haven't been with a woman for years. Give me a morsel.
24268,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, You're a dog.
24269,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," I am the Imp, and I demand to know."
24270,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, I knew you were fucking her. A pair of tall blond toffs. Must be like looking in the mirror.
24271,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. Where's your drink? What are you, what are you doing up North?"
24272,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, What are you doing with that?
24273,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," Oh, this? This is for you. For both of you."
24274,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, You're supposed to be south.
24275,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts. Do you know that?
24276,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, That's a bit rude.
24277,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," Year after year, I've shoveled Lannister shit, and what do I have to show?"
24278,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," You're a knight, thanks to me."
24279,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, Thanks to me. And that title's worth as much as a blonde hair from your brother's ballsack.
24280,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, Power resides where men believe-
24281,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, Shut your mouth.
24282,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, I'm just trying-
24283,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," I've never hit a dwarf before, but say another word and I will belt you."
24284,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all-"
24285,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," You couldn't do it on your best day, you one-handed fuck. And your best days are long gone."
24286,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, You broke my nose!
24287,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, I did not break your nose.
24288,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, How do you know?
24289,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size, and I know what it sounds like. Now listen. Your sister offered me Riverrun. Nice big castle, good lands, plenty of peasants who do what they're told."
24290,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,  And you trust Cersei-
24291,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," I knew your sister was dead the second I saw those dragons. Now, your army may be torn to shit, but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win. And it just so happens I'm a betting man. If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up."
24292,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," Mmm, that's good. Of course, the odds change if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead. Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one. All of a sudden-"
24293,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, May I speak?
24294,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, Why not? Only death will shut you up.
24295,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, We made a deal long ago. Do you remember?
24296,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," If anyone offered me money to kill you, you'd pay me double. What's double Riverrun?"
24297,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, Highgarden. You could be Lord of the Reach.
24298,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, Highgarden? Are you mad?
24299,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, It's better than being dead.
24300,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, He's not going to kill us. He wouldn't be talking to us if-
24301,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," The way I see it, I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive."
24302,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.
24303,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1," No? Who were your ancestors, the ones who made your family rich? Fancy lads in silk? They were fucking cutthroats. That's how all the great houses started, isn't it? With a hard bastard who was good at killing people. Kill a few hundred people, they make you a lord. Kill a few thousand, they make you king. And then all your cocksucking grandsons can ruin the family with their cocksucking ways."
24304,BRONN,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, Highgarden. Give me your word.
24305,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1, You have my word. None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing. We ride south in the morning. We could use an officer with knowledge of the city's defenses.
24306,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1", For fuck's sake.
24307,ARAY,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1", On your own?
24308,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1", Not anymore. I don't like crowds.
24309,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1", Me neither.
24310,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1", Why not? They all love you now. You're the big hero.
24311,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1", Don't like heroes.
24312,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1", It must have felt good sticking a knife in that horned fucker.
24313,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1", Felt better than dying. You're heading to King's Landing?
24314,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1", I have some unfinished business.
24315,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1", Me too.
24316,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1", I don't plan on coming back.
24317,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1", Neither do I.
24318,THE HOUND,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1", Gonna leave me to die again if I get hurt?
24319,ARYA,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1",  Probably.
24320,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,  My lady.
24321,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1," ""My lord"" is the standard response."
24322,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1, Why her?
24323,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1, You know she loves your brother.
24324,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1, That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.
24325,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1," You seem determined to dislike her. A good relationship between the Iron Throne and the North has been the core of every peaceful, prosperous reign we've ever known."
24326,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1," Jon will be Warden of the North, so a good relationship seems likely."
24327,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1, I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.
24328,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1," Well, I suppose that's up to him."
24329,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1," Sansa, look at me."
24330,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,"  With Jon in the capital, you'll be the true power in the North. I'd feel much better about the future if I left here today believing that you and Daenerys were allies."
24331,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1, What are you worried about? Jon's taking our army with him. Your queen still has her dragons--
24332,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1, She's your queen too.
24333,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1," You don't have to be her friend. But why provoke her? How is that in the best interest of your family, or the North, or-"
24334,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1, You're afraid of her.
24335,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1, Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.
24336,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1, I don't want Jon to go down there. The men in my family don't do well in the capital.
24337,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1," No, but as your brother once told me, he's not a Stark."
24338,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1, Are you all right?
24339,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1," Her people love her, you've seen that. You've seen how they fight for her. She wants to make the world a better place. I believe in her."
24340,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1, Tyrion.
24341,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1, What if there's someone else? Someone better?
24342,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13, You're not gonna ride the dragon south?
24343,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13, Just a horse. Rhaegal needs to heal. He doesn't need me weighing him down.
24344,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13, (scoffs). You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.
24345,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13, (laughs)
24346,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13, I'm taking the Free Folk home. We've had enough of the south. The women down here don't like me.
24347,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13," This is the North, you know. And the Free Folk are welcome to stay."
24348,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13, It isn't home. We need room to wander. I'll take them back through Castle Black as soon as the winter storms pass. Back where we belong.
24349,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13, It's where he belongs too. A direwolf has no place in the south. Will you take him with you? He'll be happier up there.
24350,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13, So would you.
24351,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13," I wish I was going with you. This is farewell, then."
24352,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13, You never know.
24353,TORMUND,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13, You've got the North in you. The real North.
24354,SAM,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13," Yes, well, the nights have been getting longer and there wasn't that much to do in Oldtown. There's only so many books a person can read, so we-"
24355,GILLY,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13," I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam. If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon."
24356,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13, I hope it's a girl.
24357,SAM,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13, You're the best friend I ever had.
24358,JON,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13," You too, Sam."
24359,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1," Think of the past twenty years. The war, the murder, the misery. All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone who didn't love him back."
24360,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1, How many others know?
24361,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1, Including us? Eight.
24362,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1," Well, then it's not a secret anymore. It's information. If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon. Then what happens?"
24363,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1," She loses the North. She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that."
24364,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1," No, it's worse than that. He has the better claim to the throne."
24365,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1, He doesn't want the throne.
24366,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1," I'm not sure it matters what he wants. The fact is, people are drawn to him. Wildlings, Northmen. He's a war hero."
24367,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1," He loves our queen. And she loves him. If we marry them, they could rule together."
24368,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1, (with distaste) She's his aunt.
24369,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1, That never stopped a Targaryen before.
24370,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1," No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell. Is marrying your aunt common in the North? You know our queen better than I do. Do you think she wants to share the throne? She does not like to have her authority questioned."
24371,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,  Something she has in common with every monarch who ever lived.
24372,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1, I worry about her state of mind.
24373,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1, We are advisors to the queen. Worrying about her state of mind is our job. We still have to take King's Landing. Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all. That would solve our problems.
24374,GREY WORM,8,71,the last of the starks,THE TARGARYEN FLEET_5, Get to the skiff.
24375,GREY WORM,8,71,the last of the starks,THE TARGARYEN FLEET_5, Now!
24376,SOLDIER 1,8,71,the last of the starks,THE TARGARYEN FLEET_5, Spears!
24377,SOLDIER 2,8,71,the last of the starks,THE TARGARYEN FLEET_5, They're coming round again!
24378,SOLDIER 3,8,71,the last of the starks,THE TARGARYEN FLEET_7, Go!
24379,SOLDIER 4,8,71,the last of the starks,THE TARGARYEN FLEET_7, Clear!
24380,SOLDIER 5,8,71,the last of the starks,THE TARGARYEN FLEET_7, Man your stations!
24381,MISSANDEI,8,71,the last of the starks,THE TARGARYEN FLEET_7, No!
24382,SOLDIER 4,8,71,the last of the starks,THE TARGARYEN FLEET_7, Go! Go!
24383,SOLDIER 5,8,71,the last of the starks,THE TARGARYEN FLEET_7, Clear!
24384,GREY WORM,8,71,the last of the starks,THE SHORE OF BLACKWATER BAY_1,  Missandei? Missandei!
24385,GREY WORM,8,71,the last of the starks,THE SHORE OF BLACKWATER BAY_1, Missandei!
24386,CERSEI,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY_1"," Our message was well-received, then?"
24387,QYBURN,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY_1", Your people have heard the Usurper is coming. They are grateful for your protection within the walls of the Red Keep.
24388,CERSEI,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY_1", You're certain about the dragon?
24389,EURION,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY_1", I saw it sink beneath the waves.
24390,CERSEI,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY_1", That must have been glorious.
24391,EURON,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY_1"," The glory is yours, my queen."
24392,CERSEI,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY_1"," When the war is won, the Lion shall rule the land, the Kraken shall rule the sea, and our child shall one day rule them all."
24393,EURON,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY_1", She's coming for you.
24394,CERSEI,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY_1"," Of course she is. Keep the gates open. If she wants to take the castle, she'll have to murder thousands of innocent people first."
24395,CERSEI,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY_1"," So much for ""the Breaker of Chains."""
24396,GREY WORM,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1," We will storm the city, my queen. We will kill your enemies. All of them."
24397,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1, Your Grace. I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly if I ever thought you were making a mistake. This is a mistake.
24398,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1, You saw my child fall from the sky.
24399,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1, (nods)
24400,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1, They took Missandei.
24401,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1," Cersei needs to be destroyed, but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied and the Dothraki, tens of thousands of innocents will die. That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep. These are the people you came here to protect. I beg you, Your Grace. Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat."
24402,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1," Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys? I'm here to free the world from tyrants. That is my destiny and I will serve it, no matter the cost."
24403,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1," It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies make it to King's Landing. In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender. Offer her her life in exchange for the throne. If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter, we should make the effort."
24404,DAENERYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1," Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter. But perhaps it's good the people see that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed, and Cersei Lannister refused. They should know whom to blame when the sky falls down upon them."
24405,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,  I've served tyrants most of my life. They all talk about destiny.
24406,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones and walked out with three dragons. How could she not believe in destiny?
24407,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, Perhaps that's the problem. Her life has convinced her that she was sent here to save us all.
24408,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, And how do you know she wasn't?
24409,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1," Then there's the problem of Jon Snow. Perhaps it's actually a solution. You know them both. Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler?"
24410,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, He doesn't want the throne. That's why he bent the knee.
24411,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, Have you considered the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule?
24412,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, We're discussing treason.
24413,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.
24414,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, Of course I've thought about it. Thoughts aren't treason.
24415,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1," He's temperate and measured. He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros, whose support we are going to need."
24416,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1," Joffrey was a man. I don't think a cock is a true qualification, as I'm sure you'd agree."
24417,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1," And he's the heir to the throne. Yes, because he's a man. Cocks are important, I'm afraid."
24418,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, What about my earlier proposal? They could rule together as king and queen.
24419,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1," She's too strong for him. She'd bend him to her will, as she already has."
24420,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, He could temper her worst impulses.
24421,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, As you have? You're drinking quite a lot. A Targaryen father and a Stark mother. Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.
24422,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, How many kings and queens have you served? Five? Six? I've lost count.
24423,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, You've always known my reasons.
24424,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,"  At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person."
24425,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, Even if you know it's a mistake?
24426,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, I believe in our queen. She'll make the right choice. With the help of her loyal advisers.
24427,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, You know where my loyalty stands. You know I will never betray the realm.
24428,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1," What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne."
24429,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1," Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne. We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I. They deserve to live. They deserve food for their children. I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost."
24430,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1," So, what happens to her?"
24431,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,  Please. Don't.
24432,VARYS,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1, I've spoken as honestly as I can. Each of us has a choice to make. I pray we choose wisely.
24433,MAN 1,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, DAY_1", I'm just about to start it.
24434,WOMAN 1,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, DAY_1", Good luck.
24435,MAN 2,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, DAY_1", Protect shell right up to the wall.
24436,MAN 1,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, DAY_1"," All right, I'll put another one on it."
24437,MAN 3,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, DAY_1", He's headed down to the cellar. I'll need a cart over here.
24438,MAN 4,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, DAY_1"," That's it, thanks. Thank you."
24439,WOMAN 2,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, DAY_1"," It's really heavy, mind you."
24440,MAN 5,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, DAY_1", We need some more water.
24441,MAN 3,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, DAY_1", Take it down there!
24442,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE COURTYARD_3, . . . as are the rest of her advisors.
24443,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE COURTYARD_3, What happened?
24444,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE COURTYARD_3," Euron Greyjoy ambushed Queen Daenerys and her fleet. One of the dragons was killed, several ships destroyed, Missandei captured."
24445,SANSA,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE COURTYARD_3, I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister. Seems like I won't get the chance.
24446,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", They're going to destroy that city. You know they will.
24447,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", Have you ever run away from a fight?
24448,BRIENNE,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", You're not like your sister. You're not. You're better than she is. You're a good man and you can't save her. You don't need to die with her. Stay here. Stay with me. (voice breaking) Please. Stay.
24449,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1"," You think I'm a good man? I pushed a boy out a tower window, crippled him for life for Cersei. I strangled my cousin with my own hands just to get back to Cersei. I would have murdered every man, woman and child in Riverrun for Cersei."
24450,JAIME,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1", She's hateful. And so am I.
24451,QYBURN,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1", My lord.
24452,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1", Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's unconditional surrender and the immediate release of Missandei of Naath.
24453,QYBURN,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1"," Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's unconditional surrender. If she refuses, Missandei of Naath will die here and now."
24454,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1"," Qyburn, you're a rational man."
24455,QYBURN,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1"," Or so I flatter myself, my lord."
24456,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1"," We have a chance here, perhaps our last chance, to avoid carnage."
24457,QYBURN,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1", Yes.
24458,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1", Help me. I don't want to see this city burn. I don't want to hear the screams of children burning alive.
24459,QYBURN,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1"," No, it is not a pleasant sound."
24460,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1", I- I don't want to hear it. Help me save this city.
24461,QYBURN,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1"," My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen."
24462,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1", Your queen.
24463,QYBURN,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1", Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. You are her subject.
24464,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1", Her reign is over. You understand this. Help her understand it.
24465,QYBURN,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1"," We understand nothing of the sort. Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable. Your armies are battle-weary and depleted, while ours have been reinforced with the Golden Compan-"
24466,CAPTAIN,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1", Ready! Nock! Draw!
24467,TYRION,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1","  I know you don't care about your people. Why should you? They hate you and you hate them. But you're not a monster. I know this. I know this because I've seen it. You've always loved your children. More than yourself, more than Jaime more than anything. I beg you. If not for yourself, then for your child. Your reign is over, but that doesn't mean your life has to end. It doesn't mean your baby has to die."
24468,CERSEI,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1"," (to MISSANEDEI) If you have any last words, now is the time."
24469,MISSANDEI,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1", Dracarys.
24470,VARYS,8,72,the bells,Unnamed Scene_132, Come in.
24471,VARYS,8,72,the bells,Unnamed Scene_132, And?
24472,MARTHA,8,72,the bells,Unnamed Scene_132, (shakes her head)
24473,VARYS,8,72,the bells,Unnamed Scene_132, Nothing?
24474,MARTHA,8,72,the bells,Unnamed Scene_132, She won't eat.
24475,VARYS,8,72,the bells,Unnamed Scene_132, We'll try again at supper.
24476,MARTHA,8,72,the bells,Unnamed Scene_132, I think they're watching me.
24477,VARYS,8,72,the bells,Unnamed Scene_132, Who?
24478,MARTHA,8,72,the bells,Unnamed Scene_132,  Her soldiers.
24479,VARYS,8,72,the bells,Unnamed Scene_132, Of course they are. That's their job.
24480,VARYS,8,72,the bells,Unnamed Scene_132," What have I told you, Martha?"
24481,MARTHA,8,72,the bells,Unnamed Scene_132," The greater the risk, the greater the reward."
24482,VARYS,8,72,the bells,Unnamed Scene_132, (Nods.) Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.
24483,VARYS,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1, The Northern armies?
24484,JON,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1, Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?
24485,VARYS,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1," She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food."
24486,JON,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1, She shouldn't be alone.
24487,VARYS,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1, You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.
24488,JON,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1, Aren't you worried for her?
24489,VARYS,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1," I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath."
24490,JON,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1, We're not much for riddles where I'm from.
24491,VARYS,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1, We both know what she's about to do.
24492,JON,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1, That's her decision to make. She is our queen.
24493,VARYS,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1," Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it."
24494,JON,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1, What do you want?
24495,VARYS,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1, All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.
24496,JON,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1, I don't want it. I never have.
24497,VARYS,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1," (Sighs.) I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true"
24498,JON,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1, She is my queen.
24499,TYRION,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, Your Grace?
24500,TYRION,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, There's something you need to know.
24501,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, Someone has betrayed me.
24502,TYRION,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, Yes.
24503,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, Jon Snow.
24504,TYRION,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, Varys.
24505,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, He knows the truth about Jon.
24506,TYRION,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, He does.
24507,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3," Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me."
24508,TYRION,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
24509,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, And Varys?
24510,TYRION,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
24511,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, (angrily) You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.
24512,TYRION,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, It was a mistake.
24513,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?
24514,TYRION,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, She trusts me.
24515,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3," Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down."
24516,TYRION,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3," If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone."
24517,TYRION,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, But it doesn't matter now.
24518,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3, No. It doesn't matter now.
24519,TYRION,8,72,the bells,CAVERNS BENEATH DRAGONSTONE_1, It was me.
24520,VARYS,8,72,the bells,CAVERNS BENEATH DRAGONSTONE_1," (Nods.) I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend."
24521,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,CAVERNS BENEATH DRAGONSTONE_1," Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ..."
24522,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,CAVERNS BENEATH DRAGONSTONE_1, ... sentence you to die. Dracarys.
24523,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT_1", This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.
24524,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT_1"," (in Valyrian) It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him."
24525,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT_1", What did I say would happen if you told your sister?
24526,JON,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT_1"," I don't want it, and that's what I told him."
24527,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT_1", She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.
24528,JON,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT_1", I love you. And you will always be my queen.
24529,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT_1", Is that all I am to you? Your queen?
24530,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT_1"," All right, then."
24531,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT_1",  Let it be fear.
24532,TYRION,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT_1"," The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen."
24533,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT_1"," In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived."
24534,TYRION,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT_1", They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.
24535,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT_1", They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?
24536,TYRION,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT_1", What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
24537,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT_1", Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.
24538,TYRION,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT_1","  I beg you, my queen-"
24539,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT_1", But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.
24540,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT_1"," (to GREY WORM) Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies."
24541,TYRION,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT_1"," Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack."
24542,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT_1", Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.
24543,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT_1", Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.
24544,DAENERYS,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT_1",  It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.
24545,GUARD 1,8,72,the bells,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, DAY_1", Let them pass.
24546,GUARD 2,8,72,the bells,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, DAY_1", Through the gate.
24547,GUARD 3,8,72,the bells,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, DAY_1", Get going.
24548,DAVOS,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, DAY_1", The rearguard should be here by daybreak.
24549,TYRION,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, DAY_1", She wants to attack now.
24550,JON,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, DAY_1", Daybreak at the earliest.
24551,SOLDIER 1,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, DAY_1", Careful with that.
24552,SOLDIER 2,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, DAY_1", My lord.
24553,TYRION,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, DAY_1"," Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?"
24554,DAVOS,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, DAY_1"," I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?"
24555,SOLDIER 1,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", He's always better when he's got some food in him.
24556,SOLDIER 2,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", Problem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?
24557,SOLDIER 1,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", Aye. Fighting as well. Commander nearly caught him.
24558,SOLDIER 3,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", Ay up. Where you going?
24559,ARYA,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
24560,THE HOUND,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1"," Think about it. She kills Cersei, the war's over. There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow."
24561,SOLDIER 3,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", I need to go talk to my captain.
24562,THE HOUND,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1"," Go ahead, talk to him."
24563,SOLDIER 1,8,72,the bells,"THE ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT_1", Where's he going?
24564,TYRION,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT_1, (speaking Valyrian) I drink to eat the skull keeper.
24565,TYRION,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT_1, (speaking Valyrian) I want to eat the skull keeper.
24566,TYRION,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT_1, (struggling to speak Valyrian) I want to see the ...
24567,UNSULLIED,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT_1, We speak the common tongue.
24568,TYRION,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT_1, Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.
24569,UNSULLIED,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT_1, We have orders to guard the prisoner.
24570,TYRION,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT_1, Ordered by whom? The queen herself?
24571,UNSULLIED,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT_1,  No.
24572,TYRION,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT_1," Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot."
24573,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, How did they find you?
24574,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, Did you consider taking it off?
24575,JAIME,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1," Cersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister."""
24576,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1," And you're going back to her, to die with her."
24577,JAIME,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, You've underestimated her before.
24578,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
24579,JAIME,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, Difficult to do from here.
24580,JAIME,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?
24581,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1," Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise."
24582,JAIME,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1," To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise."
24583,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.
24584,JAIME,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1," The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win."
24585,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1," She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be."
24586,JAIME,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.
24587,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, The city will fall tomorrow.
24588,JAIME,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1," She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-"
24589,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.
24590,JAIME,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1," Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before."
24591,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, Why?
24592,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1," Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life."
24593,JAIME,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-
24594,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1," There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again."
24595,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, Swear to me.
24596,JAIME,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, You have my word.
24597,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1," If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered."
24598,JAIME,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, I'll try.
24599,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1," I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates."
24600,JAIME,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, Your queen will execute you for this.
24601,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1," If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible."
24602,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1," Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never would've survived my childhood."
24603,JAIME,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, You would have.
24604,TYRION,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1, You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.
24605,SOLDIER 1,8,72,the bells,"KING'S LANDING, MORNING_1", Eyes on the horizon!
24606,SOLDIER 2,8,72,the bells,"KING'S LANDING, MORNING_1", Load the scorpion!

24616,SOLDIER 2,8,72,the bells,THE STREET BELOW_1," Inside, now!"
24617,MAN 1,8,72,the bells,THE STREET BELOW_1, Quickly.
24618,SOLDIER 2,8,72,the bells,THE STREET BELOW_1, Yes. Follow down there. They're here. Get to the Red Keep.
24619,FATHER,8,72,the bells,THE STREET BELOW_1, My son!

24621,MAN 2,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER STREET_1," Just ahead of you, I can see it!"
24622,SOLDIER 1,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER STREET_1," All right, move it!"
24623,WOMAN,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER STREET_1, Come on!

24632,SOLDIER 4,8,72,the bells,A DIFFERENT STREET_1, Make way for the Golden Company!
24633,SOLDIER 4,8,72,the bells,A DIFFERENT STREET_1, Close the gate!
24634,TYRION,8,72,the bells,THE STARK AND TARGARYEN ARMY_1," If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered. Call off your men."
24635,SOLDIER 1,8,72,the bells,THE STARK AND TARGARYEN ARMY_1," Move along now, lads."
24636,SOLDIER 2,8,72,the bells,THE GROUNDS OF THE RED KEEP_1, That's it.
24637,SOLDIER 3,8,72,the bells,THE GROUNDS OF THE RED KEEP_1," Go on, move it."
24638,SOLDIER 3,8,72,the bells,THE GROUNDS OF THE RED KEEP_1," Come on, move, move. Faster, faster. Come on, move it. Keep going."
24639,SOLDIER 2,8,72,the bells,THE GROUNDS OF THE RED KEEP_1, Keep moving.
24640,THE HOUND,8,72,the bells,THE GROUNDS OF THE RED KEEP_1, Move.
24641,SOLDIER 2,8,72,the bells,THE GROUNDS OF THE RED KEEP_1, Stay with him.
24642,MAN,8,72,the bells,THE GROUNDS OF THE RED KEEP_1, Hold on.
24643,WOMAN,8,72,the bells,THE GROUNDS OF THE RED KEEP_1, Hold my hand.
24644,NORA,8,72,the bells,THE GROUNDS OF THE RED KEEP_1, Get behind there.
24645,SOLDIER 1,8,72,the bells,THE GROUNDS OF THE RED KEEP_1, Close the gate! No more through!

24799,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,Unnamed Scene_133, I'm going alone.
24800,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_53," In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen, I sentence you to die."
24801,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_53, Grey Worm!
24802,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_53, It's over.
24803,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_53,  These men are prisoners. It is not over until the queen's enemies are defeated.
24804,DAVOS,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_53, How much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.
24805,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_53,  They are breathing.
24806,DAVOS,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_53," Look around you, friend. We won."
24807,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_53,"  I obey my queen's commands, not yours."
24808,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_53, And what are the queen's commands?
24809,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_53,"  ""Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister."" These are free men. They chose to fight for her."
24810,DAVOS,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_53," Easy, men. Easy! Easy."
24811,DAVOS,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_53, Jon. We should speak with the queen.
24812,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, (in Dothraki) Blood of my blood.
24813,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.
24814,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms.
24815,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, Torgo Nudho.
24816,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1," (in Valyrian) You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War."
24817,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, (in Valyrian) Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!
24818,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, (in Valyrian) But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!
24819,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1," (in Valyrian) From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel."
24820,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, (in Valyrian) Will you break the wheel with me?
24821,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, You freed your brother. You committed treason.
24822,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.
24823,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, (In Valyrian) Take him.
24824,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, What are you doing here?
24825,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1," Hey, what happened?"
24826,ARYA,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.
24827,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, (sighs) She's everyone's queen now.
24828,ARYA,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, Try telling Sansa.
24829,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.
24830,ARYA,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1, Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.
24831,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, Did you bring any wine?
24832,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, No.
24833,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1," Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, ""See, I told you."" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going."
24834,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, (sighs)
24835,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, So is there life after death?
24836,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, Not that I've seen.
24837,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.
24838,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, You didn't.
24839,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"  I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not."
24840,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.
24841,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"  Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?"
24842,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.
24843,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1," And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today."
24844,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
24845,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1," You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister."
24846,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1," My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day."
24847,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, Cersei left her no choice.
24848,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1," The moment the gates fell, the battle was over."
24849,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
24850,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, And she burned down a city for it.
24851,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1," Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield."
24852,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, Would you have done it?
24853,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, What?
24854,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1," You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?"
24855,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, I don't know.
24856,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1," (scoffs) Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know."
24857,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, What's it matter what I'd do?
24858,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1," It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men."
24859,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, (sighs)
24860,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1," When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
24861,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.
24862,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1," ""Love is the death of duty."""
24863,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, You just came up with that?
24864,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
24865,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1," Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"
24866,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?
24867,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, That's her decision. She is the queen.
24868,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, I'm sorry it came to this.
24869,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?
24870,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
24871,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,  Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
24872,JON,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,  She doesn't get to choose.
24873,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,  No. But you do. And you have to choose now.
24874,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11," When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet."
24875,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11, I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
24876,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11, It was necessary.
24877,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,"  Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!"
24878,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11, I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.
24879,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11, And Tyrion?
24880,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11," He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?"
24881,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11, Forgive him.
24882,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,  I can't.
24883,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11," You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand."
24884,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11," Please, Dany."
24885,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11, We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.
24886,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11, The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.
24887,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,  And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.
24888,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11, How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?
24889,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,  Because I know what is good. And so do you.
24890,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11, I don't.
24891,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,  You do. You do. You've always known.
24892,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11, What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.
24893,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11, They don't get to choose.
24894,DAENERYS,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11," Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastard's name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together."
24895,JON,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11," You are my queen. Now, and always."
24896,SANSA,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Where's Jon?
24897,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", He is our prisoner.
24898,SANSA,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.
24899,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", We will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.
24900,SANSA,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest."
24901,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.
24902,YARA,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
24903,SANSA,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", You swore to follow a tyrant.
24904,YARA,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves."
24905,ARYA,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.
24906,DAVOS,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?"
24907,DAVOS,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," If it weren't for you and your men, we would've lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way."
24908,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", We do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.
24909,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", It's not for you to decide.
24910,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.
24911,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", (nods) You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.
24912,YOHN ROYCE,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", We don't have a king or queen.
24913,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.
24914,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," Make your choice, then."
24915,EDMURE,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", My lords and ladies.  I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives. What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history. I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country. A veteran of two wars. And I like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst-
24916,SANSA,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Uncle? Please sit.
24917,YOHN ROYCE,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," Well, we have to choose someone."
24918,SAM,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Why just us?
24919,SAM,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone."
24920,EDMURE,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.
24921,YOHN ROYCE,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", I'll ask my horse.
24922,EDMURE,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", (to TYRION) I suppose you want the crown.
24923,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Me? The Imp?
24924,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her."
24925,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Can't think of a worse choice.
24926,DAVOS,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1","  Who, then?"
24927,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.
24928,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?"
24929,SANSA,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
24930,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break."
24931,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm."
24932,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?"
24933,BRAN,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Why do you think I came all this way?
24934,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.
24935,SAM,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Aye.
24936,EDMURE,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Aye.
24937,RIVERLANDS LORD,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Aye.
24938,YOHN ROYCE,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Aye.
24939,MAESTER WOLKAN,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Aye.
24940,ROBIN,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", (nods) Aye.
24941,DORNISH PRINCE,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Aye.
24942,YARA,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Aye.
24943,IRONBORN LORD,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Aye.
24944,VALE LORD,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Aye.
24945,GENDRY,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", (with a definitive nod) Aye.
24946,DAVOS,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye."
24947,BRIENNE,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", Aye.
24948,SANSA,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years."
24949,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
24950,ALL,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", All hail Bran the Broken!
24951,BRAN,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," Lord Tyrion, you will be my Hand."
24952,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," N- No, Your Grace, I don't want it."
24953,BRAN,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", And I don't want to be king.
24954,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else."
24955,BRAN,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",  I choose you.
24956,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", You cannot.
24957,BRAN,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1"," Yes, I can. I'm king."
24958,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", This man is a criminal. He deserves justice.
24959,BRAN,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", He just got it. He's made many terrible mistakes. He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.
24960,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1", (shakes his head) It is not enough.
24961,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.
24962,JON,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, There's still a Night's Watch?
24963,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.
24964,JON,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, (sighs)
24965,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1," You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose."
24966,JON,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, Was it right? What I did?
24967,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, What we did.
24968,JON,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, It doesn't feel right.
24969,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, Ask me again in ten years.
24970,JON,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.
24971,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.
24972,JON,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1, (nods)
24973,UNSULLIED CAPTAIN,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING WHARFS_1, (in Valyrian) All the men have boarded.
24974,GREY WORM,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING WHARFS_1,  (in Valyrian) Good. We sail for the isle of Naath.
24975,SANSA,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?
24976,JON,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1," The North is free, thanks to you."
24977,SANSA,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, But they lost their king.
24978,JON,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.
24979,JON,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1," You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black."
24980,ARYA,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, I can't.
24981,JON,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?
24982,ARYA,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, (chuckles) I'm not going back north.
24983,SANSA,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, Where are you going?
24984,ARYA,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, What's west of Westeros?
24985,JON,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, (chuckles) I don't know.
24986,ARYA,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.
24987,JON,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, You have your Needle?
24988,ARYA,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, Right here.
24989,JON,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, Your Grace.
24990,JON,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.
24991,BRAN,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1, You were exactly where you were supposed to be.
24992,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, That's not- Uh-
24993,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, What's this?
24994,SAM,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.
24995,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.
24996,SAM,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Oh, I wouldn't say that."
24997,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Oh, he's kind to me. Never would've guessed."
24998,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, He's not kind?
24999,SAM,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  He-
25000,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, He what? What does he say about me?
25001,SAM,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem."
25002,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Your Grace.
25003,DAVOS,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Your Grace.
25004,BRONN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Your Grace.
25005,SAM,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Your Grace.
25006,BRAN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, We appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers. And a Master of Laws. And a Master of War.
25007,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks."
25008,BRAN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, And Drogon? Any word?
25009,SAM,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," He was last spotted flying east, toward-"
25010,BRONN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," The farther away, the better."
25011,BRAN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Perhaps I can find him. Do carry on with the rest.
25012,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," As you wish, Your Grace."
25013,BRIENNE,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Ser Podrick.
25014,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," (clearing his throat) We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign."
25015,SAM,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  Long may he reign.
25016,DAVOS,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,  Long may he reign.
25017,BRIENNE,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Long may he reign.
25018,BRONN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Long may he reign.
25019,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, That will improve.
25020,BRAN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, (smiling) I'm sure it will.
25021,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?"
25022,BRONN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," In full, my lord Hand."
25023,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?
25024,BRONN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Indeed we can.
25025,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair."
25026,DAVOS,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.
25027,BRONN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin."
25028,DAVOS,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," ""Any more."""
25029,BRONN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, You Master of Grammar now too?
25030,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population."
25031,SAM,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-
25032,BRONN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, The strong live and the weak don't.
25033,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Find the best builders and set them to the task.
25034,BRONN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction."
25035,SAM,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, Uh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.
25036,BRONN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1," Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly."
25037,BRIENNE,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.
25038,BRONN,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, I think that's a very presumptuous statement.
25039,TYRION,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1, I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
25040,MAN,8,73,the iron throne,WINTERFELL_41, The Queen in the North!
