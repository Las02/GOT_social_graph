388,391,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.",
389,392,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I can be quick.,
390,393,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?,

I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then.

443,446,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.,

449,452,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?",

511,514,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.,

513,516,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch.

520,523,sandor clegane,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.,
521,524,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady?

559,566,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?,
560,567,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,How dare you speak to your King in that manner?,

564,571,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.,

585,592,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I'd forgot the damned wolf.,
586,594,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,So be it.,
587,595,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,We have another wolf.,
588,596,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,As you will.,

590,598,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.,

598,607,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Is this some trick?,
599,608,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.,
600,609,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,The butcher's boy... You rode him down?,
601,610,sandor clegane,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,He ran... Not very fast.,

607,618,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.,
608,619,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.",
609,620,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You've chosen your opponents wisely then.,
610,621,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.",
611,622,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,But you just stood there and watched.,
612,623,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.",
613,624,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?,
614,625,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?",

618,629,varys,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.,
619,630,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.,
620,631,renly baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...",
621,632,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.",
622,633,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.",
623,634,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.,
624,635,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.,
625,636,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.",
626,637,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.",
627,638,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Grand Maester.,
628,639,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,How many years has it been? You were a young man.,
629,640,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,And you served another King.,
630,641,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?",
631,642,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Without the King?,
632,643,renly baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.",
633,644,varys,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.,
634,645,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,We are the lords of small matters here.,
635,646,renly baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.,
636,647,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Mmm, how much?",
637,648,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.",
638,649,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Can the treasury bear such expense?,
639,650,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?",
640,651,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?,
641,652,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.,
642,653,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,How could you let this happen?,
643,654,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.,
644,655,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.,
645,656,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.",
646,657,renly baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"""Counting coppers,"" he calls it.",
647,658,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.,
648,659,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.",
649,660,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.",
650,661,varys,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.",

652,663,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It's ugly.,
653,664,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.",
654,665,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.",
655,666,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.",
656,667,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Do I have to marry her?,
657,668,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.",
658,669,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I don't want to.,
659,670,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.",
660,671,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.,
661,672,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,How would you handle them?,
662,673,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.",
663,674,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,A royal army?,
664,675,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.",
665,676,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,And if the northerners rebel?,
666,677,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.",
667,678,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?",
668,679,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,For me. I'm their King.,
669,680,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.",
670,681,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'm not asking.,
671,682,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.",
672,683,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,So you agree... The Starks are enemies?,
673,684,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.,
674,685,mordane,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.",
675,686,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'm practicing.,
676,687,sansa stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Practicing for what?,
677,688,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The Prince.,
678,689,mordane,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Arya, stop!",
679,690,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.,
680,691,sansa stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The Hound killed your friend.,
681,692,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.,
682,693,sansa stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You're an idiot.,
683,694,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.",
684,695,mordane,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Enough!,
685,696,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,What's happening here?,
686,697,mordane,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.,
687,698,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love",
688,699,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?,
689,700,sansa stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?,
690,701,mordane,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You've barely eaten a thing.,
691,702,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It's all right. Go on.,
692,703,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,War was easier than daughters.,
693,704,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Go away!,
694,705,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?",
695,706,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Mine.,
696,707,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.,
697,708,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.,
698,709,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Come here. Now what do you want with this?,
699,710,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It's called Needle.,
700,711,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?,
701,712,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Stick 'em with the pointy end.,
702,713,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,[laughs] That's the essence of it.,
703,714,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.,
704,715,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.",
705,716,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.",
706,717,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.,
707,718,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,So was I! He is a liar.,
708,719,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.",
709,720,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,But how you can let her marry someone like that?,
710,721,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Well  Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.,
711,722,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Winter is coming.,
712,723,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.",
713,724,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I don't hate her. Not really.,
714,725,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.",
715,726,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I can keep it?,
716,727,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.",
717,728,old nan,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.,
718,729,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I hate your stories.,
719,730,old nan,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.,
720,731,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.,
721,732,old nan,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds",
722,733,robb stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,What are you telling him now?,
723,734,old nan,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Only what the little Lord wants to hear.,
724,735,robb stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.,
725,736,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Maybe we do.,
726,737,robb stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.",
727,738,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.",
728,739,robb stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Don't ever say that.,
729,740,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'd rather be dead.,

739,753,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.,
740,754,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?,
741,755,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,A dear friend told me.,

746,760,varys,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.",
747,761,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Do you know whose dagger this is?,
748,762,varys,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I must admit I do not.,

750,764,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Yours?,
751,765,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.",
752,766,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,To whom?,
753,767,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.,

757,775,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.,

759,777,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Both.,
760,778,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.,

777,795,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.,
778,796,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice,
779,797,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,They hate me because I'm better than they are.,
780,798,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.,
781,799,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.,

791,809,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?,
792,810,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.,
793,811,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Then what are you raving about?,
794,812,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...,
795,813,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.,
796,814,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,And my husband?,
797,815,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us,

813,831,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Off with you.,

820,838,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?",

Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?",
825,843,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.,

910,928,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,We ride for Vaes Dothrak.,
911,929,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.,
912,930,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.,
913,931,aemon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?",

917,935,aemon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually,
918,936,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers.",

920,938,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.,
921,939,aemon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.,

930,948,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.,

941,959,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.,
942,960,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,What if I drop it?,
943,961,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.",

The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me.",

958,976,robb stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.",
959,977,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.,
960,978,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?,
961,979,luwin,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,He has no memory of that day.,

970,988,bran stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I'm not a cripple.,
971,989,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.,
972,990,bran stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Will I really be able to ride?,
973,991,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.,
974,992,robb stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?,
975,993,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.",
976,994,robb stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.,

981,999,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?",

985,1003,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?",
986,1004,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Must have been a pretty sight.,

988,1006,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,We were outnumbered 10 to one.,
989,1007,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire.",

1048,1071,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?,
1049,1072,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,A pirate ship?,
1050,1073,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,A dragon.,

1242,1267,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,This stinks of manure. All of it.,
1243,1268,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Stop - stop it.,
1244,1269,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair.",
1245,1270,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.,
1246,1271,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You do not talk back to me!,
1247,1272,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon...,
1248,1273,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.,
1249,1274,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.,
1250,1275,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I wouldn't doubt it.,
1251,1276,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?,
1252,1277,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Sally on the side?,
1253,1278,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd.",
1254,1279,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.,
1255,1280,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.,
1256,1281,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.",
1257,1282,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I find that hard to believe.,
1258,1283,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but...",

1260,1285,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I know where to put it.,
1261,1286,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Was she... Old and ugly?,
1262,1287,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.,
1263,1288,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What color hair?,
1264,1289,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Red.,
1265,1290,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I like red hair. And her... Her...,

1267,1292,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,That good?,
1268,1293,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Better.,
1269,1294,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...,
1270,1295,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What's my name?,
1271,1296,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Jon Snow?,
1272,1297,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,And why is my surname Snow?,
1273,1298,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Because... You're a bastard from the north.,
1274,1299,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.",
1275,1300,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,So... You didn't know where to put it?,
1276,1302,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,It is a bit nippy.,
1277,1304,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I build my own fires.,
1278,1306,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I hit him. I hit the dragon.,
1279,1307,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.,
1280,1308,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,He is still the true King.,
1281,1309,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,The truth now,
1282,1310,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.,
1283,1311,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play.",
1284,1312,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?",
1285,1313,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Home.,
1286,1314,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.,
1287,1315,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Lover's quarrel?,

1292,1320,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Arya!,
1293,1321,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Don't be rude!,
1294,1322,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.",
1295,1323,robert baratheon,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!,
1296,1324,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Gods, who is that?",
1297,1325,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Hound's older brother.,
1298,1326,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,And his opponent?,
1299,1327,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.,
1300,1328,robert baratheon,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!",
1301,1329,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story.",
1302,1330,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I won't tell anyone. I promise.,
1303,1331,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you.",

1308,1336,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us   the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?,
1309,1337,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,She likes it here.,
1310,1338,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her.",
1311,1339,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What are you doing here?,
1312,1340,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?,

Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies.

He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.

He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?",harrenhal

13035,13672,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?",
13036,13673,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it.",
13037,13674,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You fell in love with a whore.,
13038,13675,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.",
13039,13676,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.,
13040,13677,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,At least I got to tell them what they really are.,
13041,13678,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride.",
13042,13679,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me.",
13043,13680,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.,
13044,13681,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall.",
13045,13682,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,(laughs),
13046,13683,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.,
13047,13684,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,It is tempting.,
13048,13685,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life.",
13049,13686,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,If he wins.,
13050,13687,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.,
13051,13688,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,No. Not Ser Meryn.,
13052,13692,cersei lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.,
13053,13693,cersei lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You seem to be in good form.,

13055,13695,cersei lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Does it matter?,
13056,13696,gregor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,(Shakes his head.),
13057,13697,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Could be food.,
13058,13698,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Could be soldiers.,
13059,13699,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.,
13060,13700,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down.",
13061,13701,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Who were ""they""?",
13062,13702,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I stopped asking a while ago.,
13063,13703,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,That's not gonna get better.,
13064,13704,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Doesn't seem so.,
13065,13705,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?,
13066,13706,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.,
13067,13707,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,So why go on?,
13068,13708,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Habit.,
13069,13709,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Nothing could be worse than this.,
13070,13710,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Maybe nothing is worse than this.,
13071,13711,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.,
13072,13712,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Who are you?,
13073,13713,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,My name is Arya. Arya Stark.,

13075,13715,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,(Shakes his head.) Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.,
13076,13716,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work.",
13077,13717,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Wish it were wine.,
13078,13718,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,So do I.,
13079,13719,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.,
13080,13720,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,The fuck you doing?,
13081,13721,rorge,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,There's a price on your head.,
13082,13722,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.,
13083,13723,rorge,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.,
13084,13724,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?",
13085,13725,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.,
13086,13726,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?,
13087,13727,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,He can't be. I don't know his name.,
13088,13728,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,What's your name?,

13097,13742,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.,

13100,13745,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,We've been preparing.,
13101,13746,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.,
13102,13747,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,And how would we range north?,
13103,13748,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,We wouldn't.,
13104,13749,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?",
13105,13750,grenn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,We can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.,
13106,13751,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel.",

13108,13753,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.,
13109,13754,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,They won't stop them.,

13116,13761,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?",

13127,13772,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.,
13128,13773,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.,
13129,13774,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.,
13130,13775,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,She's dim-witted.,

13134,13779,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,And you understand the rules of inheritance?,
13135,13780,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Falyse is forty and barren.,
13136,13781,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.,
13137,13782,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.,
13138,13783,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,(scoffs.),
13139,13784,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.,
13140,13785,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?,

13142,13787,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Is it two wives you want or two castles?,
13143,13788,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle.",
13144,13789,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.,
13145,13790,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?,
13146,13791,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.,

13151,13796,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?",
13152,13797,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Because you're my friend.,
13153,13798,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?",

13157,13802,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.,
13158,13803,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,We had some good days together.,

13161,13806,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?,
13162,13807,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I hope to hear them sing it one day.,
13163,13808,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,",
13164,13809,daario naharis,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,But your window is not.,

13192,13837,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.,

13300,13945,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.,
13301,13946,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.,
13302,13947,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.,

Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother.""

13324,13969,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.,

""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew.

In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.",king's landing

She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons.
