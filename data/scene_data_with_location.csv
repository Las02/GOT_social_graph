Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time.

Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are.

Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children.

1723,1755,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight.

1732,1764,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.",

She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha.

Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.",

Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on.",

He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.

8412,8896,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father.,

8415,8899,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,How?,
8416,8900,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.,
8417,8901,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.,
8418,8902,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.,

8452,8936,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,I'm sure she's jealous of you now. You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.,
8453,8937,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,"I want us to be friends, good friends.",

8839,9334,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER,"The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?",
8840,9335,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER,"First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me.",

Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?",

You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back.

13282,13927,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.,
13283,13928,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.,
13284,13929,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.,
13285,13930,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.,

13289,13934,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",You and my family have more in common than you might admit.,
13290,13935,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT","The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.",
13291,13936,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",That would have made things so much easier.,
13292,13937,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT","When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long.""",
13293,13938,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT","Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.",
13294,13939,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.,
13295,13940,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT","If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.",
13296,13941,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",I disagree.,
13297,13942,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT","I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too.

13312,13957,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.,
13313,13958,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,"Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door.",
13314,13959,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,I like the sound of that.,

Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings?

Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?",
13700,14355,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Maester Faull,
13701,14356,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library.",
13702,14357,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.,
13703,14358,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.,
13704,14359,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I don't love her.,
13705,14360,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Yes you do.,
13706,14361,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,No.,
13707,14362,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.,
13708,14363,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You were?,
13709,14364,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?",
13710,14365,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that.",
13711,14366,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You know who I was before I came here? What I could've been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.,
13712,14367,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Who was she?,
13713,14368,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.,
13714,14369,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!",
13715,14370,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!",
13716,14371,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"I'm sorry, I can't.",
13717,14372,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do.",
13718,14373,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Pyp! Open the gate.,
13719,14374,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I can't.,

13721,14376,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Yes!,
13722,14377,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.,

13726,14381,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella.",
13727,14382,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,It was horrible.,
13728,14383,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.,
13729,14384,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Don't let them send me away, Sam.",
13730,14385,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Never.,
13731,14386,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I know there's no women allowed.,

13738,14393,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Yes sir.,
13739,14394,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You can say it if you like. We should've sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.,
13740,14395,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"It was a difficult decision either way, Ser.",
13741,14396,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job.",
13742,14397,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.,

13747,14402,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,What are you going to do out there?,
13748,14403,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Help my brothers.,
13749,14404,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.,
13750,14405,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.,
13751,14406,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here.",
13752,14407,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do.",

13755,14410,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.,
13756,14411,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?,

If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid.",

And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye.  Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't.  Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now.  While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter.  She protects people from monsters, just as you do.  That's why she came here.  And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting.  That's not a reasonable thing to ask.",
20478,21542,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,So do you have anything reasonable to ask?,

21633,22758,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,"I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is.",
21634,22759,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,It's good to see you again.,

21638,22763,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?,
21639,22764,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,You might.,
21640,22765,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.,
21641,22766,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.,
21642,22767,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother. You know who’s coming for you. You’ve always known.",
21643,22768,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Where is she?,
21644,22769,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,She'll be here soon.,
21645,22770,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Didn't travel with you?,
21646,22771,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,No.,
21647,22772,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,We've been here for some time.,
21648,22773,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,My apologies.,
21649,22774,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,We are all facing a unique--,
21650,22775,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"Theon! I have your sister. If you don’t submit to me here, now… I’ll kill her.",
21651,22776,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.,
21652,22777,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.,
21653,22778,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes?,
21654,22779,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,His wasn't even good.,
21655,22780,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.,
21656,22781,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents.",
21657,22782,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Perhaps you ought to sit down.,
21658,22783,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Why?,
21659,22784,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Sit down or leave.,
21660,22785,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face.",
21661,22786,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?",
21662,22787,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,We all know that will never happen.,
21663,22788,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Then why are we here?,
21664,22789,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.,
21665,22790,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.,
21666,22791,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.,
21667,22792,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce.",
21668,22793,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Yes. That's all.,
21669,22794,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.,
21670,22795,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.,
21671,22796,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,The word of a would-be usurper.,
21672,22797,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.,
21673,22798,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,We can destroy them by burning them.,
21674,22799,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world.",
21675,22800,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.,
21676,22801,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.,
21677,22802,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,How many?,
21678,22803,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"A hundred thousand, at least.",
21679,22804,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Can they swim?,
21680,22805,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,No.,
21681,22806,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.,
21682,22807,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,What are you talking about?,
21683,22808,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me.",
21684,22809,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive.",
21685,22810,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy.",
21686,22811,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,(SIGHS),
21687,22812,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"In return, the King",
21688,22813,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Just the King,
21689,22814,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"(CHUCKLES) I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son.",
21690,22815,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.,
21691,22816,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.,
21692,22817,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Ser Jaime.,
21693,22818,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.,
21694,22819,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.,
21695,22820,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother.",
21696,22821,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"Oh, fuck loyalty!",
21697,22822,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Fuck loyalty?,
21698,22823,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.,
21699,22824,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,And tell her what?,
21700,22825,davos seaworth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I wish you hadn't done that.,
21701,22826,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing.",
21702,22827,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I know!,
21703,22828,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen  I would have advised it, had you asked. But have you ever considered learning how to lie every now and then? Just a bit?",
21704,22829,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father if you want, tell me that’s the attitude that got him killed. But when enough people make false promises, words stop meaning anything. Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies, and lies won’t help us in this fight.",
21705,22830,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.,
21706,22831,davos seaworth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?,
21707,22832,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister.",
21708,22833,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I didn't come all this way to have my Hand murdered.,
21709,22834,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.,
21710,22835,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I did this. I should go.,
21711,22836,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister alone. Or we all go home and we’re right back where we started.,

21717,22842,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.",

21724,22849,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.,

You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one would've touched them if Father was here, no one would have dared-",
