0,waymar royce,1,1,winter is coming,Unknown,"What d'you expect? They're savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they're ripping each other to pieces."
1,will,1,1,winter is coming,Unknown,"I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I've never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life."

3,will,1,1,winter is coming,Unknown,Close as any man would.

7,yohn royce,1,1,winter is coming,Unknown,You don't think he'll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
8,will,1,1,winter is coming,Unknown,Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.
9,yohn royce,1,1,winter is coming,Unknown,"It's a good thing we're not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter ... If I don't catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won't say it again."

17,mordane,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_1,"Fine work, as always. Well done."
18,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_1,Thank you.
19,mordane,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_1,I love the detail that you've managed to get in this corners. ... Quite beautiful ... the stitching ...
20,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_2,"And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on."
21,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_2,"Don't think too much, Bran."
22,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_2,Relax your bow arm.
24,rodrik cassel,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_2,Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch.
25,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_2,Get the lads to saddle their horses.
26,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_2,Do you have to?
27,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_2,"He swore an oath, Cat."
28,rodrik cassel,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_2,"The law is law, my lady."
29,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_2,"Tell Bran he's coming, too."
30,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_2,Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.
31,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_2,He won't be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
32,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_2,"Lad, go run back and get the rest."
33,will,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,"White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them."
34,will,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,"I know I broke my oath. And I know I'm a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I'm no coward. Tell them I'm sorry."
35,will,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,"Forgive me, lord."
36,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name ..."
37,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,Don't look away.
38,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,King of the Andals and the First Men ...
39,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,Father will know if you do.
40,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die."
41,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,You did well.
42,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,You understand why I did it?
43,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,Jon said he was a deserter.
44,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,But do you understand why I had to kill him?
45,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,Our way is the old way?
46,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
47,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
48,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
49,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,So he was lying?
50,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,AND WE SEE WILL BEING TAKEN TO THE BLOCK,A madman sees what he sees.
51,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,What is it?
52,theon greyjoy,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,Mountain lion?
53,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,There are no mountain lions in these woods.
54,theon greyjoy,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,It's a freak.
55,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,It's a direwolf.
56,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,Tough old beast.
57,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
58,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,Now there are five.
59,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,You want to hold it?
60,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,Where will they go? Their mother's dead.
61,rodrik cassel,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,They don't belong down here.
62,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,Better a quick death. They won't last without their mother.
63,theon greyjoy,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,Right. Give it here.
64,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,NO!
65,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,Put away your blade.
66,theon greyjoy,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,"I take orders from your father, not you."
67,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,"Please, father!"
68,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,"I'm sorry, Bran."
69,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
70,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,"You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves."
71,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,What about you?
72,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,I'm not a Stark. Get on.
73,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,What is it?
74,theon greyjoy,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_4,"The runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow."
75,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,The Iron Throne Room,"As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you"
76,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,The Iron Throne Room,"And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid."
77,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,The Iron Throne Room,"There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools."
78,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,The Iron Throne Room,What if Jon Arryn told someone?
79,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,The Iron Throne Room,But who would he tell?
80,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,The Iron Throne Room,My husband.
81,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,The Iron Throne Room,"If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on."
82,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,The Iron Throne Room,You should be the Hand of the king.
83,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,The Iron Throne Room,"That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short."
84,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_5,All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
85,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_5,You have five northern children. You're not an outsider.
86,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_5,I wonder if the old gods agree.
87,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_5,It's your gods with all the rules.
88,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_5,"I am so sorry, my love."
89,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_5,Tell me.
90,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_5,There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
91,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_5,Your sister. The boy ...
92,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_5,They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
93,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_5,"He's coming this far North, there's only one thing he's after."
94,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_5,"You can always say no, Ned."
95,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Great Hall,We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.
96,luwin,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Great Hall,I'm told he drinks all night.
97,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Great Hall,How much could he possibly drink? A man of his ... stature.
98,luwin,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Great Hall,We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.
99,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Great Hall,"In any case, candles."
100,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Barber,Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
101,theon greyjoy,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Barber,"It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's [sleek as a mink?]"
102,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Barber,I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
103,theon greyjoy,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Barber,Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
104,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Barber,"Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair."
105,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_6,"Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!"
106,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_6,I saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!
107,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_6,How many times have I told you
108,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_6,But he's coming right now! Down our road!
109,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_6,I want you to promise me
110,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_6,I promise.
111,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_6,D'you know what?
112,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_6,What?
113,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_6,You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
114,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,"Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?"
115,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,"Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA's helm]"
116,arya stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,Move!
117,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,Your Grace.
118,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,You've got fat.
119,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,Cat!
120,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,Your Grace.
121,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,Nine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
122,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,"Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours."
123,arya stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,Where's the Imp?
124,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,Will you shut up?
125,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,"Who have we here? You must be Robb. (To Sansa) My, you're a pretty one. (To Arya) Your name is?"
126,arya stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,Arya.
127,arya stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,That's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.
128,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,Would you please shut up.
129,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,My queen.
130,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,My queen.
131,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
132,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,"We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait."
133,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,Ned.
134,arya stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,Where's the Imp?
135,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_7,Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
136,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Crypt,Tell me about Jon Arryn.
137,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Crypt,"One minute he was fine, and then ... Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man."
138,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Crypt,We both did.
139,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Crypt,"He never had to teach you much, but me ... You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what."
140,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Crypt,Aye.
141,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Crypt,"Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. (They laugh. ROBERT sighs.) I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king."
142,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Crypt,I'm not worthy of the honor.
143,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Crypt,"I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses."
144,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
145,ros,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?
146,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,I did hear something about that.
147,ros,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
148,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,And the other brother?
149,ros,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,The queen has two brothers?
150,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.
151,ros,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,I hear they call him the Imp.
152,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,I hear he hates that nickname.
153,ros,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
154,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,Clever girl.
155,ros,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,"We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion."
156,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,Have you?
157,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,The gods gave me one blessing.
158,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,Don't get up.
159,ros,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,M'lord.
160,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,"Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
161,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,"You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention."
162,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,"She has odd cravings, our sister."
163,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,"A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people."
164,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,"I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses."
165,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,"I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, (he opens the door; a bevy of whores enter and descend on TYRION) Come on, girls. See you at sundown."
166,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Whorehouse,Close the door!
167,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,TO THE WINTERFELL CRYPT AT LYANNA'S TOMB,Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
168,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,TO THE WINTERFELL CRYPT AT LYANNA'S TOMB,She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
169,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,TO THE WINTERFELL CRYPT AT LYANNA'S TOMB,She belonged with me.
170,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,TO THE WINTERFELL CRYPT AT LYANNA'S TOMB,"In my dreams, I kill him every night."
171,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,TO THE WINTERFELL CRYPT AT LYANNA'S TOMB,"It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone."
172,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,TO THE WINTERFELL CRYPT AT LYANNA'S TOMB,Not all of them.
173,varys,1,1,winter is coming,TO DAENERYS ON A BALCONY IN PENTOS ACROSS THE NARROW SEA,Daenerys!
174,varys,1,1,winter is coming,TO DAENERYS ON A BALCONY IN PENTOS ACROSS THE NARROW SEA,Daenerys! There's our bride to be! Look - a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?
175,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,TO DAENERYS ON A BALCONY IN PENTOS ACROSS THE NARROW SEA,We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
176,varys,1,1,winter is coming,TO DAENERYS ON A BALCONY IN PENTOS ACROSS THE NARROW SEA,"Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. (He pulls off her gown.) You have a woman's body now. (She endures it as he strokes her breast.) I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?"
177,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,TO DAENERYS ON A BALCONY IN PENTOS ACROSS THE NARROW SEA,No.
178,varys,1,1,winter is coming,TO DAENERYS ON A BALCONY IN PENTOS ACROSS THE NARROW SEA,"When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today."
180,varys,1,1,winter is coming,TO ILLYRIOS DAENERYS AND VISERYS OUTSIDE THE MANSION AWAITING KHAL DROGO,Where is he?
181,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,TO ILLYRIOS DAENERYS AND VISERYS OUTSIDE THE MANSION AWAITING KHAL DROGO,The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
182,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,TO ILLYRIOS DAENERYS AND VISERYS OUTSIDE THE MANSION AWAITING KHAL DROGO,"(Greets them in Dothraki.) May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen."
183,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,TO ILLYRIOS DAENERYS AND VISERYS OUTSIDE THE MANSION AWAITING KHAL DROGO,"Come forward, my dear."
184,varys,1,1,winter is coming,TO ILLYRIOS DAENERYS AND VISERYS OUTSIDE THE MANSION AWAITING KHAL DROGO,Where's he going?
185,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,TO ILLYRIOS DAENERYS AND VISERYS OUTSIDE THE MANSION AWAITING KHAL DROGO,The ceremony is over.
186,varys,1,1,winter is coming,TO ILLYRIOS DAENERYS AND VISERYS OUTSIDE THE MANSION AWAITING KHAL DROGO,But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?
187,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,TO ILLYRIOS DAENERYS AND VISERYS OUTSIDE THE MANSION AWAITING KHAL DROGO,"Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know."
188,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Pentos Garden,It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
189,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Pentos Garden,When will they be married?
190,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Pentos Garden,Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
191,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Pentos Garden,Is it true they lie with their horses?
192,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Pentos Garden,I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
193,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Pentos Garden,Do you take me for a fool?
194,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Pentos Garden,I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.
195,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Pentos Garden,I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
196,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Pentos Garden,"So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?"
197,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,Pentos Garden,I don't know.
198,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Pentos Garden,"We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took."
199,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Sansas Bedroom,Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?
200,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Sansas Bedroom,Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
201,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Sansas Bedroom,He's so handsome.
202,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Sansas Bedroom,When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
203,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Sansas Bedroom,Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
204,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Sansas Bedroom,Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
205,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Sansas Bedroom,He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.
206,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Sansas Bedroom,You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
207,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Sansas Bedroom,Sansa...
208,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Sansas Bedroom,"Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted."
209,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,Is he dead yet?
210,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,Uncle Benjen!
211,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?
212,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
213,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,"Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there."
214,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,So take me with you when you go back.
215,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,Jon...
216,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,"Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will."
217,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,The Wall isn't going anywhere.
218,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,I'm ready to swear your oath.
219,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
220,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,I don't care about that.
221,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,"You might, if you knew what it meant. ... I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later."
222,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
223,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,What're you doing back there?
224,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.
225,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?
226,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,"My greatest accomplishment. You - you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?"
227,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,"Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though."
228,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
229,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,"And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you."
230,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
231,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet,All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.
232,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,You at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.
233,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
234,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,"Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger."
235,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
236,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,The two he was with are still missing.
237,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,A wildling ambush.
238,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
239,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,Winter is coming.
240,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,Uncle Benjen.
241,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,Robb boy. How are ye?
242,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,I'm good.
243,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,Yes. Lovely country.
244,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,"I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time."
245,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,"Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?"
246,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,"Thirteen, Your Grace."
247,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,You're tall. Still growing?
248,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,"I think so, Your Grace."
249,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,And have you bled yet?
250,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,"No, Your Grace."
251,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,And your dress. Did you make it?
252,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,Such talent. You must make something for me.
253,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
254,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,I hear the same.
255,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
256,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,Your pardon.
257,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.
258,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,"Yes, the king has honored me with his offer."
259,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,"I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale."
260,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,I don't fight in tournaments.
261,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,No? Getting a little old for it?
262,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,"I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do."
263,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,Well said.
264,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,Arya!
265,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,BACK TO THE BANQUET IN FULL RAUCOUS SWING,Time for bed.
266,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,"I'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital."
267,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,I won't let him take you.
268,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.
269,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,"I'll say, 'Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'"
270,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,How did he get so fat?
271,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.
273,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,Send him in.
274,luwin,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,"Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister."
275,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,Stay.
276,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,This was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.
277,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,What news?
278,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
279,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,"She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying."
280,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,"Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?"
281,luwin,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,"If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?"
282,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
283,luwin,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,"The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord."
284,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. (To NED) Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.
285,luwin,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Banquet_1,A different time. Different king.
286,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Khal Drogo and Daenarys Wedding,When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
287,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Khal Drogo and Daenarys Wedding,"If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it."
288,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Khal Drogo and Daenarys Wedding,When?
289,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Khal Drogo and Daenarys Wedding,When their omens favour war.
290,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Khal Drogo and Daenarys Wedding,I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
291,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Khal Drogo and Daenarys Wedding,A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
292,jorah mormont,1,1,winter is coming,Khal Drogo and Daenarys Wedding,A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
293,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,Khal Drogo and Daenarys Wedding,"Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?"
294,jorah mormont,1,1,winter is coming,Khal Drogo and Daenarys Wedding,"Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king."
295,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Khal Drogo and Daenarys Wedding,"Dragons' eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful."
296,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,Khal Drogo and Daenarys Wedding,"Thank you, Magister."
297,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,Khal Drogo and Daenarys Wedding,"She's beautiful. ... Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say 'thank you' in Dothraki."
298,jorah mormont,1,1,winter is coming,Khal Drogo and Daenarys Wedding,There is no word for 'thank you' in Dothraki.
299,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Khal Drogo and Daenarys Wedding,Make him happy.
300,khal drogo,1,1,winter is coming,Seaside,No.
301,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,Seaside,Do you know the Common Tongue?
302,khal drogo,1,1,winter is coming,Seaside,No.
303,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,Seaside,Is 'no' the only word that you know?
304,khal drogo,1,1,winter is coming,Seaside,No.
305,sandor clegane,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_8,"Rough night, Imp?"
306,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_8,"If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle."
307,sandor clegane,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_8,I didn't pick you for a hunter.
308,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_8,The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
309,sandor clegane,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_8,It's not hunting if you pay for it.
310,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_8,Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
311,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_8,"No, but I'm still better than you."
312,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_8,I know what I'm putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You're a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I've got.
313,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_8,I hope I'll serve you well.
314,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_8,"You will. And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!"
315,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell_8,"Come on, you."
316,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Tower,Stop. STOP.
317,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Tower,Are you completely mad?
318,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Tower,He saw us.
319,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Tower,It's all right. It's all right.
320,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Tower,He saw us!
321,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Tower,"I heard you the first time. (To BRAN) Quite the little climber, aren't you? How old are you, boy?"
322,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Tower,Ten
323,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Tower,Ten.
324,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Winterfell Tower,The things I do for love.
325,jorah mormont,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp,"You need to drink, child... And eat."
326,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp,Isn't there anything else?
327,jorah mormont,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp,The Dothraki have two things in abundance
328,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_1,Khaleesi!
329,irri,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_1,Your hands.
330,jorah mormont,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_1,"We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there."
331,viys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_1,I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
332,jorah mormont,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_1,"As you wish, your Grace."
333,viys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_1,"Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?"
334,jorah mormont,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_1,Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
335,viys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_1,"Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that."
336,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dog Pen,"Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today."
337,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dog Pen,"Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies."
338,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dog Pen,What good will my sympathies do them?
339,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dog Pen,None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
340,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dog Pen,The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
341,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dog Pen,One word and I'll hit you again.
342,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dog Pen,I'm telling mother!
343,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dog Pen,"Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?"
344,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dog Pen,You can't...
345,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dog Pen,Do you understand?
346,sandor clegane,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dog Pen,"The Prince will remember that, little lord."
347,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dog Pen,"I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast..."
348,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,"Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black."
349,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,Little brother.
350,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,Beloved siblings.
351,myrcella baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,Is Bran going to die?
352,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,Apparently not.
353,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,What do you mean?
354,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,The Maester says the boy may live.
355,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,"It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
356,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
357,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
358,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,"Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers."
359,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
360,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
361,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
362,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,"Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day."
363,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,"Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say."
364,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,"My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on."
365,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Dining Hall,"My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family."
366,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room,Please.
367,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room,"I would have dressed, your Grace."
368,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room,"This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now."
369,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room,I never knew.
370,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room,"It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."
371,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room,I am grateful..
372,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room,Perhaps this time she'll listen.
373,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Smith,A sword for the wall?
374,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Smith,I already have one.
375,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Smith,Good man. Have you swung it yet?
376,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Smith,Of course I have.
377,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Smith,"At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."
378,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Smith,We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
379,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Smith,"Is it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?"
380,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Smith,Soon enough.
381,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell Smith,"Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life."
382,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,"Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway."
383,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,It's good you've got help.
384,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,"Watch. Nymeria, gloves."
385,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,Impressive.
386,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,"Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!"
387,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
388,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,A present?
389,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
390,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,It's so skinny.
391,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,"So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."
392,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,I can be quick.
393,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
394,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,I think so.
395,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,First lesson
396,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,I know which end to use.
397,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,"I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know."
398,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Arya s Room,Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
399,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_1,I came to say goodbye to Bran.
400,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_1,You've said it.
401,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_1,"I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."
402,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_1,I want you to leave.
403,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_1,17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
404,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_1,I have no choice.
405,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_1,"That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't."
406,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_1,You can. You must.
407,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell_9,You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
408,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell_9,You Starks are hard to kill.
409,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell_9,My mother?
410,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell_9,She was very kind.
411,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell_9,"Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."
412,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell_9,It was always my color.
413,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell_9,"Farewell, Snow."
414,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Winterfell_9,"And you, Stark."
415,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Crossroads,"There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood."
416,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Crossroads,"Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?"
417,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Crossroads,"The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise."
418,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,"Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going."
419,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,I've half a mind to go with you.
420,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,"What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight."
421,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,You should have asked me 20 years ago.
422,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,"There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young."
423,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,I recall a few chances.
424,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,"There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in."
425,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,Bessie. She was one of yours.
426,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastard's mother?
427,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,Wylla.
428,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
429,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,Nor will I.
430,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,"We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already."
431,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
432,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,"Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night."
433,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
434,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,"A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
435,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,She's little more than a child.
436,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
437,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,Tell me we're not speaking of this.
438,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,"Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on."
439,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,"But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?"
440,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,"This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."
441,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,"Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert."
442,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,"There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him."
443,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,"He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea."
444,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Kings Road,"There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming."
445,benjen stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to the Wall,Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
446,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to the Wall,Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
447,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to the Wall,Why do you read so much?
448,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to the Wall,Look at me and tell me what you see.
449,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to the Wall,Is this a trick?
450,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to the Wall,"What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."
451,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to the Wall,Until your brother killed that King.
452,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to the Wall,"Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"
453,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to the Wall,"Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
454,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to the Wall,"A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms."
455,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to the Wall,The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
456,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to the Wall,"Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly."
457,luwin,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,"It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us."
458,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,Talk to Poole about it.
459,luwin,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,"Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention..."
460,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,I don't care about appointments!
461,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
462,luwin,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,"Very good, my Lord. My Lady."
463,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,When was the last time you left this room?
464,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,I have to take care of him.
465,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,"He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed."
466,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
467,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,"Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying..."
468,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop! (Wolf s howling repeatedly)
469,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
470,assassin,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
471,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Brann s Room_2,No!
472,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,Have you ever seen a dragon?
473,irri,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,"Dragon gone, Khaleesi."
474,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,Everywhere? Even in the east?
475,irri,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
476,jhiqui,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,It is known.
477,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
478,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,The moon?
479,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,"He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire."
480,irri,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
481,jhiqui,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,It is known.
482,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
483,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,"Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy."
484,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,How old were you?
485,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
486,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,Nine?!
487,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,"I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn."
488,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
489,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,Yes.
490,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,Will it take three years?
491,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,No.
492,benjen stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Dothraki Camp_2,Welcome.
493,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
494,luwin,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,The boy was always sure-footed before.
495,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
496,theon greyjoy,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,"Saw what, my lady?"
497,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
498,rodrik cassel,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,"Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him."
499,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
500,theon greyjoy,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,"If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
501,luwin,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,"What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this."
502,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
503,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,I'll ride to King's Landing.
504,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
505,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,"Mother, you can't."
506,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,I must.
507,rodrik cassel,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
508,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
509,rodrik cassel,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
510,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,What about Bran?
511,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Godswood,I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
512,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Daenary s Tent Dothraki Camp,"No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes."
513,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Daenary s Tent Dothraki Camp,Finish a man?
514,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Daenary s Tent Dothraki Camp,Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
515,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Daenary s Tent Dothraki Camp,"Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top."
516,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Daenary s Tent Dothraki Camp,"You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you."
517,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Daenary s Tent Dothraki Camp,I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
518,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Daenary s Tent Dothraki Camp,"If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?"
519,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Daenary s Tent Dothraki Camp,No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
520,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing,"Pardon me, Ser."
521,sandor clegane,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing,"Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face."
522,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing,"I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?"
523,sandor clegane,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing,He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
524,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing,"He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me."
525,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing,"Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts."
526,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing,My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
527,mycah,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,I'll get you!
528,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,Arya!
529,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,What are you doing here? Go away.
530,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,"Your sister? And who are you, boy?"
531,mycah,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,"Mycah, my Lord."
532,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,He the butcher's boy.
533,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,He's my friend.
534,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,"A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are."
535,mycah,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,"She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to."
536,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,"I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword."
537,mycah,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,"It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick."
538,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,"And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?"
539,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,Stop it!
540,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,"Arya, stay out of this."
541,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
542,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,"No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!"
543,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,"I'll gut you, you little cunt!"
544,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,Arya!
545,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,Nymeria!
546,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,Please don't.
547,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,"Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help."
548,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_1,Then go! Don't touch me.
550,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_2,You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
554,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_2,Go!
555,jory cassel,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_2,My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
556,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_2,Where is she?
557,jory cassel,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_2,She's been taken directly before the King.
558,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_2,Who took her?
559,jory cassel,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_2,The Lannisters found her.
560,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_2,"Right, get back."
561,jory cassel,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_2,The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
562,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Road to King s Landing_2,Back! Back to the inn. All back!
563,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,I'm sorry.
564,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Are you hurt?
565,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,No.
566,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
567,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
568,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,"Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly."
569,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
570,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
571,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
572,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,That's not what happened!
573,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
574,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Liar!
575,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Shut up!
576,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,"Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?"
577,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,In bed asleep.
578,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,"She's not. Sansa, come here, darling."
579,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,"Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King."
580,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
581,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Liar! Liar liar liar!
582,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Arya!
583,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Stop it! That's enough of that.
584,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Liar liar liar!
585,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Stop! Arya!
586,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
587,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,"What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over."
588,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
589,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
590,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,"Gladly, your Grace."
591,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
592,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,I'd forgot the damned wolf.
594,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,So be it.
595,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,We have another wolf.
596,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,As you will.
597,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,You can't mean it.
598,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
599,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,"He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!"
600,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
601,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
602,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,s this your command... your Grace?
603,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Where is the beast?
605,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,"Ser Ilyn, do me the honor."
606,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,"No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself."
607,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,Is this some trick?
608,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
609,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
610,sandor clegane,1,2,the kingsroad,Inn on the road to King s Landing,He ran... Not very fast.
612,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing,"Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them."
613,jory cassel,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing,"Yes, my Lord."
615,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room,"Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership."
616,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room,Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
617,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room,"Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes."
618,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room,Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
619,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room,"I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss."
620,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room,You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
621,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room,"I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."
622,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room,But you just stood there and watched.
623,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room,"500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."
624,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room,Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
625,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room,"Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"
626,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room,"You served him well, when serving was safe."
627,varys,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,Lord Stark.
628,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,Lord Varys.
629,varys,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
630,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
631,renly baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but..."
632,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."
633,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well."
634,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
635,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
636,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
637,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."
638,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,Grand Maester.
639,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,How many years has it been? You were a young man.
640,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,And you served another King.
641,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?"
642,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,Without the King?
643,renly baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."
644,varys,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
645,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,We are the lords of small matters here.
646,renly baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
647,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"Mmm, how much?"
648,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer."
649,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,Can the treasury bear such expense?
650,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
651,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
652,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
653,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,How could you let this happen?
654,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
655,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
656,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen."
657,renly baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"""Counting coppers,"" he calls it."
658,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
659,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
660,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride."
661,varys,1,3,lord snow,Small council s chamber,"You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."
662,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,"Please, it's nearly healed."
663,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,It's ugly.
664,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,"A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."
665,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,"I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."
666,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,"That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
667,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,Do I have to marry her?
668,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,"Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
669,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,I don't want to.
670,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,"No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
671,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
672,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,How would you handle them?
673,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,"I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."
674,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,A royal army?
675,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,"Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives."
676,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,And if the northerners rebel?
677,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,"I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe."
678,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,"And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
679,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,For me. I'm their King.
680,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,"But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
681,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,I'm not asking.
682,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,"The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."
683,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
684,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Joffreys room,Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
685,mordane,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,"Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food."
686,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,I'm practicing.
687,sansa stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,Practicing for what?
688,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,The Prince.
689,mordane,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,"Arya, stop!"
690,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
691,sansa stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,The Hound killed your friend.
692,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
693,sansa stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,You're an idiot.
694,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,"You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive."
695,mordane,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,Enough!
696,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,What's happening here?
697,mordane,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
698,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,"Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love"
699,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
700,sansa stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
701,mordane,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,You've barely eaten a thing.
702,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,It's all right. Go on.
703,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Dining Hall,War was easier than daughters.
704,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,Go away!
705,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,"Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?"
706,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,Mine.
707,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
708,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
709,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,Come here. Now what do you want with this?
710,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,It's called Needle.
711,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
712,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,Stick 'em with the pointy end.
713,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,[laughs] That's the essence of it.
714,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
715,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,"No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy."
716,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,"I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa."
717,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
718,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,So was I! He is a liar.
719,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,"Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong."
720,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,But how you can let her marry someone like that?
721,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,Well  Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
722,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,Winter is coming.
723,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,"You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister."
724,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,I don't hate her. Not really.
725,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,"I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours."
726,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,I can keep it?
727,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Arya s Room_1,"Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."
728,old nan,1,3,lord snow,Brann s Room_3,Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
729,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Brann s Room_3,I hate your stories.
730,old nan,1,3,lord snow,Brann s Room_3,I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
731,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Brann s Room_3,Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
732,old nan,1,3,lord snow,Brann s Room_3,"Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds"
733,robb stark,1,3,lord snow,Brann s Room_3,What are you telling him now?
734,old nan,1,3,lord snow,Brann s Room_3,Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
735,robb stark,1,3,lord snow,Brann s Room_3,Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
736,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Brann s Room_3,Maybe we do.
737,robb stark,1,3,lord snow,Brann s Room_3,"How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall."
738,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Brann s Room_3,"I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead."
739,robb stark,1,3,lord snow,Brann s Room_3,Don't ever say that.
740,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Brann s Room_3,I'd rather be dead.
741,rodrik cassel,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing_1,"Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many."
742,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing_1,It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
743,rodrik cassel,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing_1,My Lady.
745,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing_1,I would. We've done nothing wrong.
747,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing_1,"Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."
749,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,Cat! Go on. Go upstairs. (to his whores)
750,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a
751,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
752,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
753,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
754,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
755,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,A dear friend told me.
756,varys,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,Lady Stark.
757,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,Lord Varys.
758,varys,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
759,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,How did you know I was coming?
760,varys,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,"Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
761,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,Do you know whose dagger this is?
762,varys,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,I must admit I do not.
763,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,"Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."
764,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,Yours?
765,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
766,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,To whom?
767,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel,Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
772,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black,A charming man.
773,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black,I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
774,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black,"And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
775,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black,Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
776,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black,Good news or bad?
777,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black,Both.
778,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room_1,Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
779,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room_1,Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
780,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room_1,My wife is in Winterfell.
781,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room_1,Is she?
782,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room_1,I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
783,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room_1,You're a funny man. A very funny man.
784,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room_1,Ned! [poking her head out of a window]
785,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Throne Room_1,"The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds."
786,grenn,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Armory,"You broke my nose, bastard!"
787,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Armory,It's an improvement.
788,grenn,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Armory,"If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit."
789,pypar,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Armory,I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
790,grenn,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Armory,"What're you looking at, halfman?"
791,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Armory,I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
792,rast,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Armory,What do you care about our faces?
793,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Armory,"It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
794,grenn,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Armory,"We'll talk later, Lord Snow."
795,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Armory,Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
796,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Armory,Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice
797,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Armory,They hate me because I'm better than they are.
798,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Armory,It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
799,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel_1,The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
800,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel_1,We have proof. We have the blade.
801,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel_1,"Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."
802,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel_1,Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
803,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel_1,"I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."
804,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel_1,I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
805,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Baelish s Brothel_1,Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
806,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Cersei s Room,How could you be so stupid?
807,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Cersei s Room,Calm down.
808,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Cersei s Room,He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
809,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Cersei s Room,I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
810,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Cersei s Room,Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
811,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Cersei s Room,Then what are you raving about?
812,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Cersei s Room,What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
813,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Cersei s Room,We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
814,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Cersei s Room,And my husband?
815,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Cersei s Room,I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us
816,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Cersei s Room,Let me go.
817,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Cersei s Room,Never.
818,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Cersei s Room,Let me go.
819,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Cersei s Room,"The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
820,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Back Alley,I wish I could see the girls.
821,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Back Alley,It's too dangerous.
822,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Back Alley,Just for a moment.
823,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Back Alley,Until we know who our enemies are...
824,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Back Alley,"I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."
825,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Back Alley,Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
826,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Back Alley,And if you find the proof?
827,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Back Alley,"Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."
828,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Back Alley,"My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
829,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Back Alley,He still loves you.
830,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Back Alley,Does he?
831,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,King s Landing Back Alley,Off with you.
832,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
833,barristan selmy,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,"Of course, your Grace."
834,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,Who was it?
835,barristan selmy,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
836,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,How'd you do it?
837,barristan selmy,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,Lance through the heart.
838,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,"Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?"
839,lancel lannister,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,"It's empty, your Grace."
840,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,What do you mean it's empty?
841,lancel lannister,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,There's no more wine.
842,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,"Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
843,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
844,barristan selmy,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,"I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old."
845,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
846,barristan selmy,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,"A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."
847,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,Your outlaw... Any last words?
848,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,"I cut his head off, so no."
849,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
850,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,The King s Chamber,"He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace..."
851,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling",
852,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling",The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
853,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling",From whom?
854,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling","If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices"
855,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling",Tell them all to stop.
856,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling",You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
857,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling",Until I command them otherwise.
858,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling",You're learning to talk like a Queen.
859,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling",Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
860,viys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling",You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
861,irri,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling","Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
862,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling",No!
863,irri,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling","Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."
864,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling","Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed."
865,viys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling",Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
866,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling","Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?"
867,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Travelling",You walk. [to Viserys]
868,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,The Wall,I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
869,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,The Wall,You're leaving?
870,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,The Wall,I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
871,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,The Wall,What kind of reports?
872,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,The Wall,The kind I don't want to believe.
873,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,The Wall,'m ready. I won't let you down.
874,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,The Wall,"You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon."
875,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,The Wall,But I'm better than every...
876,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,The Wall,"Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return."
877,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,A bear's balls.
878,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,You're joking?
879,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,"And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
880,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,And how do a bear's balls taste?
881,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,"A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"
882,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,"Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
883,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
884,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
885,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,"The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"
886,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,"You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
887,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,"I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."
888,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,"Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
889,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,Call me what you like.
890,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
891,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,"You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."
892,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,"But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
893,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,"You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."
894,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,"Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm."
895,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,"Enjoy the capital, brother."
896,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,I always do.
897,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,"I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
898,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
899,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
900,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
901,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
902,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,"I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord."
903,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Mess Hall,Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
904,irri,1,3,lord snow,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp,"Yes, Khaleesi."
905,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp,What are you doing?
906,irri,1,3,lord snow,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp,"When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It s a blessing from the Great Stallion."
907,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent","For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."
908,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",Dothraki don t wear steel dresses.
909,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",Armor.
910,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
911,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",Slow.
912,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",Slow.
913,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent","It's true, but it also keeps a man alive."
914,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
915,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",I ve heard that your father was a famous warrior.
916,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent","He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?"
917,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
918,irri,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
919,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",There are no rabbits.
920,irri,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent","Find some ducks, she likes ducks."
921,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent","Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?"
922,irri,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
923,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",I don't think she wants to eat dog.
924,irri,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
925,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",A blessing from the Great Stallion.
926,irri,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",She does not want to eat horse.
927,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
928,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
929,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,"Dothraki Camp, Tent",Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
930,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black_1,Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
931,aemon,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Hall,"How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"
932,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Hall,"Eight... no, nine."
933,aemon,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Hall,All of them brief?
934,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Hall,"They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
935,aemon,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Hall,This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually
936,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Hall,"We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers."
937,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Hall,"Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
938,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Hall,One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
939,aemon,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Hall,The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
940,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Hall,Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
941,aemon,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black Hall,"When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready."
942,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Khal Drogo s Tent Dothraki Camp,It s a boy.
943,khal drogo,1,3,lord snow,Khal Drogo s Tent Dothraki Camp,How do you know?
944,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Khal Drogo s Tent Dothraki Camp,I know.
945,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black_2,"I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
946,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black_2,It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
947,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black_2,Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
948,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black_2,I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
949,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black_2,"If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
950,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black_2,Of course.
951,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black_2,He'll never walk again.
952,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black_2,"If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."
953,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Castle Black_2,"Farewell, My Lord."
954,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Kings Landing Sword Class,"You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday."
955,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Kings Landing Sword Class,Who are you?
956,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Kings Landing Sword Class,"Your dancing master, Syrio Forel."
957,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Kings Landing Sword Class,"Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it."
958,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Kings Landing Sword Class,It's too heavy.
959,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Kings Landing Sword Class,It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
960,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Kings Landing Sword Class,What if I drop it?
961,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Kings Landing Sword Class,"The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."
962,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Kings Landing Sword Class,I'm a girl.
963,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Kings Landing Sword Class,"Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding..."
964,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Kings Landing Sword Class,A needle.
965,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Kings Landing Sword Class,"Ahhh  Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me."
966,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Kings Landing Sword Class,"Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster."
967,old nan,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Brann s Room_4,The little Lord's been dreaming again.
968,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Brann s Room_4,We have visitors.
969,bran stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Brann s Room_4,I don't want to see anyone.
970,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Brann s Room_4,"Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting."
971,bran stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Brann s Room_4,I don't want to go.
972,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Brann s Room_4,"Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! (Hodor enters, hoisting up Bran and carrying him away) Help Bran down the hall."
973,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
974,robb stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
975,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,"Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
976,robb stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,"I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away."
977,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
978,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
979,luwin,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,He has no memory of that day.
980,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,Curious.
981,robb stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,Why are you here?
982,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
983,bran stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,"Kneel, Hodor."
984,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,"Do you like to ride, Bran?"
985,bran stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,"Yes. Well, I mean I did like to."
986,luwin,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,The boy has lost the use of his legs.
987,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,"What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
988,bran stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,I'm not a cripple.
989,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
990,bran stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,Will I really be able to ride?
991,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
992,robb stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
993,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
994,robb stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
995,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Castle,"Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier."
996,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Courtyard,"Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros."
997,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Courtyard,"Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters."
998,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Courtyard,He's not my master.
999,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Courtyard,"No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?"
1000,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Courtyard,She wasn't feeling well.
1001,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Courtyard,"She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?"
1002,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Courtyard,My lady's whereabouts...
1003,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Courtyard,"My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?"
1004,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Courtyard,Must have been a pretty sight.
1005,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Courtyard,"Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."
1006,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Courtyard,We were outnumbered 10 to one.
1007,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Courtyard,"A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire."
1008,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Courtyard,"Careful, Imp."
1009,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Winterfell Courtyard,"I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out."
1010,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,"Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it."
1011,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,What in seven hells is that?
1012,pypar,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
1014,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,"Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black."
1015,rast,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,Come to take the black pudding.
1017,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,"I yield. Please, no more."
1019,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,Enough! He yielded.
1021,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,Are you sure you want to do this?
1022,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,No. Yield yield yield! I yield.
1024,pypar,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,Well fought!
1025,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,Piss off.
1026,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,Did he hurt you?
1027,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,I've had worse.
1028,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.
1029,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,"It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself."
1030,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,Why didn't you get up and fight?
1031,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,I wanted to. I just couldn't.
1032,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,Why not?
1033,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,I'm a coward. My father always says so.
1034,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,The Wall's no place for cowards.
1035,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.
1036,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.
1037,pypar,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,You're too stupid to be a coward.
1038,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,You're too stupid to be a...
1039,pypar,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,"Quick now, before summer's over."
1040,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Courtyard,Come on here!
1041,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.
1042,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.
1043,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.
1044,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,"I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army."
1045,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,"If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?"
1046,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
1047,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,But if they did?
1048,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,"King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different."
1049,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,And you know these men?
1050,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,"I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land."
1051,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,You sold slaves.
1052,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,Aye.
1053,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,Why?
1054,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,I had no money and an expensive wife.
1055,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,And where is she now?
1056,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Vaes Dothrak,"In another place, with another man."
1057,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,Your Grace?
1058,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,"Yes, my dear?"
1059,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,They call you the last dragon...
1060,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,They do.
1061,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,You have dragon's blood in your veins?
1062,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,It's entirely possible.
1063,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
1064,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,"The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles."
1065,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
1066,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,Really? Why dragons?
1067,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,"They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy."
1068,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,"Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy."
1069,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,I was not locked in. I have seen things.
1070,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,What have you seen?
1071,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
1072,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,A pirate ship?
1073,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,A dragon.
1074,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,"No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen"
1075,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,What happened to the skulls?
1076,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,"I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind."
1077,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,That's very sad.
1078,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,"Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?"
1079,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,"No, your Grace. To teach your sister."
1080,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Viserys  Tent Dothraki Camp,To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.
1081,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,"Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince..."
1082,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,What if I have a girl?
1083,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,"Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them."
1084,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,What if I only have girls?
1085,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,I wouldn't worry about that.
1086,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,"Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls."
1087,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,"Yes, but it's highly unlikely."
1088,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,But what if?
1089,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,"If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother."
1090,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,And everyone would hate me.
1091,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,Nobody could ever hate you.
1092,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,Joffrey does.
1093,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...
1094,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,Please shut up about it.
1095,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?
1096,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,Aegon the Conqueror.
1097,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,And who built the Red Keep?
1098,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,Maegor the Cruel.
1099,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,And how many years did it take to build...
1100,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,"My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?"
1101,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,"They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes."
1102,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,The Mad King.
1103,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,Commonly known as the Mad King.
1104,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,Why were they killed?
1105,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,You should speak to your father about these matters.
1106,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,"I don't want to speak to my father, ever."
1107,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
1108,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Throne Room_2,"No, I won't."
1109,janos slynt,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,"It's the Hand's tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords."
1110,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.
1111,janos slynt,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,"Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters."
1112,varys,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,Dreadful.
1113,renly baratheon,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,"If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can."
1114,janos slynt,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,I need more men.
1115,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
1116,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,I will?
1117,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,"You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left."
1118,janos slynt,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,"Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use."
1119,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,"The sooner this is over, the better."
1120,varys,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,"The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes."
1121,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
1122,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,"I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?"
1123,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,"This heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord."
1124,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.
1125,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,"Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel."
1126,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,Why?
1127,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
1128,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,What did Jon want the night before he died?
1129,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,He came inquiring after a book.
1130,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,A book? What book?
1131,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,"I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome."
1132,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Small council s chamber_1,I'd like to read it.
1133,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,"""The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children."""

Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained"
1135,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,"As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read."
1136,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
1137,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,"He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask."
1138,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,Jon's death...
1139,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,Such a tragedy.
1140,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
1141,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,"Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating"
1142,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,"""The seed is strong""? What does that mean?"
1143,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,"The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words."
1144,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
1145,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,What else could it be?
1146,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,Poison.
1147,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
1148,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
1149,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,"Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?"
1150,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,Everybody knows that.
1151,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,"Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know."
1152,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,I've taken enough of your time.
1153,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,"No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor..."
1154,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Pycelle s Room,Thank you. I'll find my own way out.
1155,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Staircase,Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
1156,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Staircase,It's a hard fall down these steps.
1157,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Staircase,Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
1158,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Staircase,Cats? Syrio says
1159,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Staircase,He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
1160,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Staircase,He's right about that.
1161,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Staircase,Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?
1162,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Staircase,He needs to get his strength back first.
1163,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Staircase,"He wants to be a knight of the King s Guard. He can't be one now, can he?"
1164,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Staircase,No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
1165,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Staircase,Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
1166,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Staircase,You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
1167,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Staircase,No. That's not me.
1168,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,The Wall_1,"Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well."
1169,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,The Wall_1,Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.
1170,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,The Wall_1,"No, that's all right. I'm fine."
1171,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,The Wall_1,You're not. You're freezing.
1172,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,The Wall_1,I don't like high places.
1173,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,The Wall_1,"You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?"
1174,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,The Wall_1,"On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. ""You're almost a man now,"" he said, ""but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,"" he said, ""then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more."" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?"
1175,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,The Wall_1,"Yes, he is."
1176,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,The Wall_1,"I'm not going to get any better, you know?"
1177,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,The Wall_1,Well  You can't get any worse.
1178,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,I hear you're reading a boring book.
1179,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,Pycelle talks too much.
1180,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,"He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death."
1181,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
1182,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,I promised Cat that I'd help you.
1183,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.
1184,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
1185,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,Varys or the Queen?
1186,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
1187,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,Yes.
1188,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,"The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel."
1189,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,Why?
1190,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,"I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death."
1191,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,"Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you."
1192,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Gardens,Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
1193,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s Tournament,Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!
1194,hugh of the vale,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s Tournament,"As you can see, I'm busy."
1195,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s Tournament,"I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard."
1196,hugh of the vale,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s Tournament,"I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser..."
1197,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s Tournament,"No ""ser."" I'm not a knight."
1198,hugh of the vale,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s Tournament,"I see. Well, it just so happens that I am."
1199,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,"He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see."
1200,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
1201,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,"You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where."
1202,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,Let them look.
1203,tobho mott,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,"The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage."
1204,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,What did Lord Arryn want?
1205,tobho mott,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,He always came to see the boy.
1206,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,I'd like to see him as well.
1207,tobho mott,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,"As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad."
1208,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,This is fine work.
1209,gendry,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,It's not for sale.
1210,tobho mott,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,"Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet..."
1211,gendry,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,I made it for me.
1212,tobho mott,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,"Forgive him, my Lord."
1213,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,"There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?"
1214,gendry,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,"He just asked me questions is all, my Lord."
1215,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,What kind of questions?
1216,gendry,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,"About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother."
1217,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,Your mother?
1218,gendry,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,"Who she was, what she looked like."
1219,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,What did you tell him?
1220,gendry,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.
1221,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,"Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me."
1222,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,Find anything?
1223,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,King s Landing Armorer,King Robert's bastard son.
1224,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,This is for the King from Lord Stark.
1225,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.
1226,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,Three? Four?
1227,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
1228,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,"Forgive me, my Lord..."
1229,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
1230,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,"We've met before, you know."
1231,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,"Have we? Strange, I've forgotten."
1232,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
1233,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,That's where you got your scar?
1234,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
1235,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,Vicious sons of whores.
1236,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,They like their bloodshed.
1237,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
1238,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
1239,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
1240,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,Theon? He's a good lad.
1241,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,I doubt it.
1242,robert baratheon,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.
1243,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
1244,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Outside King s Chamber,I don't serve Lord Stark.
1245,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_1,Where have you been?
1246,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_1,Watch duty. With Sam.
1247,pypar,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_1,Prince Porkchop. Where is he?
1248,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_1,He wasn't hungry.
1249,pypar,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_1,Impossible!
1250,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_1,"That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him."
1251,rast,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_1,"You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon."
1252,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_1,No one touches Sam.
1254,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Training Yard,"Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield."
1256,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!
1257,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,"Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked."
1258,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,"Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us."
1259,irri,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,"Yes, Khaleesi."
1260,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,Why did you hit her?!
1261,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.
1262,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
1263,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,What's this?
1264,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,It's a gift. I had it made for you.
1265,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
1266,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,Please.
1267,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,This stinks of manure. All of it.
1268,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,Stop - stop it.
1269,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,"You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair."
1270,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
1271,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,You do not talk back to me!
1272,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
1273,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  Tent Dothraki Camp_1,I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
1274,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
1275,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,I wouldn't doubt it.
1276,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
1277,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,Sally on the side?
1278,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd."
1279,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
1280,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
1281,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,"As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."
1282,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,I find that hard to believe.
1283,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,"I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
1284,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,You didn't know where to put it?
1285,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,I know where to put it.
1286,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,Was she... Old and ugly?
1287,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
1288,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,What color hair?
1289,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,Red.
1290,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,I like red hair. And her... Her...
1291,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,You don't want to know.
1292,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,That good?
1293,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,Better.
1294,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
1295,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,What's my name?
1296,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,Jon Snow?
1297,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,And why is my surname Snow?
1298,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,Because... You're a bastard from the north.
1299,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,"I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
1300,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,So... You didn't know where to put it?
1302,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,It is a bit nippy.
1304,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Castle Black Mess Hall_2,I build my own fires.
1306,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  tent,I hit him. I hit the dragon.
1307,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  tent,Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
1308,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  tent,He is still the true King.
1309,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  tent,The truth now
1310,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  tent,No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
1311,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  tent,"The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play."
1312,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  tent,"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?"
1313,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  tent,Home.
1314,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Daenerys  tent,I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.
1315,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,Lover's quarrel?
1316,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,I'm sorry. Do I...?
1317,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,"Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known..."
1318,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
1319,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,Why do they call you Littlefinger?
1320,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,Arya!
1321,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,Don't be rude!
1322,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,"No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname."
1323,robert baratheon,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
1324,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,"Gods, who is that?"
1325,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Hound's older brother.
1326,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,And his opponent?
1327,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
1328,robert baratheon,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,"Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!"
1329,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,"Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story."
1330,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,I won't tell anyone. I promise.
1331,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Hand of the King s tournament,"No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you."
1332,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,"My Lord, Her Grace the Queen."
1333,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,Your Grace.
1334,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,You're missing your tournament.
1335,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
1336,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us   the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
1337,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,She likes it here.
1338,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,"The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her."
1339,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,What are you doing here?
1340,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
1341,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,"The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise."
1342,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,"You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces."
1343,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,"If that's my job, then so be it."
1344,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,"You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow."
1345,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,"I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace."
1346,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Ned Stark s Room,As was I.
1347,marillion,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,"Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!"
1348,catelyn stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,And to you.
1349,rodrik cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,"Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly."
1350,marillion,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,"Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?"
1351,rodrik cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,I'd rather throw myself down a well.
1352,marillion,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,"Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!"
1353,masha heddle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,"I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room."
1354,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,"My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room."
1355,masha heddle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,"Truly, my lord, we have nothing."
1356,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
1357,bronn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,You can have my room.
1358,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,"There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me."
1359,yoren,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,"Aye, my Lord."
1360,marillion,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!
1361,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
1362,masha heddle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,Lady Stark.
1363,catelyn stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,"I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?"
1364,knight of house whent,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,"It is, my Lady."
1365,catelyn stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
1366,knight of house whent,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,She is.
1367,catelyn stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
1368,knight of house bracken,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,Our lord is honored by his trust.
1369,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,"I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this."
1370,catelyn stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,Knight of House Frey
1371,catelyn stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,In Along King s Road,"This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice."
1372,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
1373,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
1374,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,He'd never worn this armor before.
1375,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
1376,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,Who determines the draw?
1377,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,"All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark."
1378,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,"Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters."
1379,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
1380,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,"I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her."
1381,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
1382,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
1383,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,"He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime."
1384,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
1385,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
1386,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,Yes. That will never happen.
1387,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,Robert tends to do what he wants.
1388,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Tournament,"If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion."
1389,lancel lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,"It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go."
1390,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
1391,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,You're too fat for your armor.
1392,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,"Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?"
1393,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,"Oh, it s funny, is it?"
1394,lancel lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,"No, Your Grace."
1395,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,No? You don't like the Hand's joke?
1396,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,You're torturing the poor boy.
1397,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,"You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!"
1398,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,The breastplate stretcher?
1399,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,How long before he figures it out?
1400,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,Maybe you should have one invented.
1401,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,"All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance."
1402,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
1403,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
1404,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,And who's going to hit you back?
1405,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
1406,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
1407,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
1408,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,Aye.
1409,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,Drink.
1410,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,I'm not thirsty.
1411,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
1412,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,Your squire... A Lannister boy?
1413,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,"Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. ""Cersei Lannister will make a good match"", he told me. ""You'll need her father on your side."" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood."
1414,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,Robert?
1415,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King Roberts Tent,"What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!"
1416,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,Where's Arya
1417,sansa stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.
1418,sansa stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,"Thank you, Ser Loras."
1419,sansa stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
1420,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,Hey.
1421,sansa stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,I can't watch.
1422,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
1423,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,I'll take that bet.
1424,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
1425,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,Or you could even buy a friend.
1426,sansa stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,He's going to die.
1427,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,Ser Loras rides well.
1428,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,"Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend."
1429,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,"And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?"
1430,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,"Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really."
1431,sansa stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
1432,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,No honor but quite a bit of gold.
1433,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,Stop this madness in the name of your King!
1434,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,"I owe you my life, Ser."
1435,sandor clegane,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Hand of the Kings Tournament,I'm no Ser.
1436,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,Remove his hood.
1437,marillion,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,"On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold. (singing)"
1438,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
1439,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,I did... often and loudly.
1440,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,"Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?"
1441,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,And why would I do that?
1442,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
1443,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
1444,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,"Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?"
1445,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,Five years ago.
1446,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,"She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here."
1447,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,"I am not a murderer, Lannister."
1448,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
1449,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,The dagger found
1450,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
1451,rodrik cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,Should I gag him?
1452,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,Why? Am I starting to make sense?
1453,rodrik cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,"My Lady, this way."
1454,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,"Untie me. If I die, what's the point?"
1455,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,Rodrik?
1456,rodrik cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,"I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself."
1457,bronn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
1458,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,On the road to Winterfell,"Well, I'm willing if she is."
1459,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,Bran...

1463,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,"Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking."
1464,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,And failed rebellions.
1465,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,Sigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King.
1466,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,Good.

1473,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,Lords - the Lannisters.
1474,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,We're still on their words.
1475,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,I don't know them.
1476,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,You do know them. Think.
1477,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,"""Unbowed, unbent, unbroken""."
1478,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,That's House Martell.

1482,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?
1483,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,"""Family, duty, honor""... Is that the right order?"
1484,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,You know it is.
1485,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,Family comes first?
1486,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
1487,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,"How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?"
1488,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
1489,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,And then she left!
1490,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,"When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely."
1491,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,Why did she leave?
1492,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,"I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon."
1493,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,Do you know where she is now? Today?
1494,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,"No, I don't."
1495,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?
1496,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
1497,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,I'll never shoot another arrow.
1498,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,And where is that written?
1499,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,You need legs to work a bow.
1500,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,"Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback."
1501,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,Really?
1502,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Winterfell Castle_1,Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?
1503,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
1504,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
1505,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,Important enough for the likes of you.
1506,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,"You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know."
1507,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
1508,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,Jealous?
1509,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,Why should I be jealous?
1510,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
1511,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,Might surprise you.
1512,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,Hmm?
1513,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
1514,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
1515,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,You are jealous.
1516,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,"I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."
1517,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,And what about the Starks?
1518,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,I ve been Lord Stark s ward since I was eight years old.
1519,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,"A  ward , that s a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again"
1520,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
1521,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,You re a very serious boy.
1522,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,I m not a boy.
1523,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,"Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock."
1524,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,I don t want to pay for it.
1525,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Theons Room,Then get yourself a wife.
1526,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing_2,Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
1527,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,"How is your son, my Lord?"
1528,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,He'll never walk again.
1529,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,But his mind is sound?
1530,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,So they say.
1531,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
1532,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,"If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
1533,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
1534,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,I didn't trust you.
1535,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,So why do you trust me now?
1536,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,"The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
1537,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,What sort of doom does the King face?
1538,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,"The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
1539,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,Who gave it to him?
1540,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,"Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
1541,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,"The squire, Ser Hugh?"
1542,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,"Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
1543,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,"If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?"
1544,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,Someone who could afford it.
1545,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
1546,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Chambers,He started asking questions.
1547,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Dungeon,He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
1548,illyrio mopatis,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Dungeon,"And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
1549,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Dungeon,"The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
1550,illyrio mopatis,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Dungeon,"What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
1551,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Dungeon,This Hand is not the other.
1552,illyrio mopatis,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Dungeon,We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
1553,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Dungeon,"""Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."
1554,illyrio mopatis,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Dungeon,It never was.
1555,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
1556,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,You do move quietly.
1557,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,We all have our qualities.
1558,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
1559,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
1560,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,"Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
1561,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,"Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
1562,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,"I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."
1563,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,"Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
1564,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
1565,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
1566,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,"Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."
1567,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,Strictly speaking.
1568,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,"Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."
1569,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,"Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
1570,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
1571,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,"Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
1572,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,Saw me with your own eyes?
1573,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,Eyes I own.
1574,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
1575,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
1576,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,One shudders at the thought.
1577,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,Oh.
1578,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
1579,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,Have you?
1580,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,"Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
1581,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,Was that you under the bed?
1582,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,"And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies  To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
1583,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,"Oh, please."
1584,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King
1585,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,"What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming."
1586,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,To a small council meeting?
1587,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Throne Room_3,Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
1589,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Blackwater Beach,I'm not a beggar. I live here.
1591,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Blackwater Beach,I want to see my father.
1594,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Blackwater Beach,"My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
1595,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
1596,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,They said they were going to kill you.
1597,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,Who did?
1598,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,"I didn't see them, but I think one was fat."
1599,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,"Oh, Arya."
1600,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
1601,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,Where did you hear this?
1602,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,"In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
1603,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,What were you doing in the dungeons?
1604,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,Chasing a cat.
1605,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,"Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent."
1606,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,"Your name, friend?"
1607,yoren,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,"Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look."
1608,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,I'm a girl!
1609,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,Did Benjen send you?
1610,yoren,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,"No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."
1611,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,"Ah, we'll find recruits for you."
1612,yoren,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,"Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow."
1613,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,Know what?
1614,yoren,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,"Best said in private, my Lord."
1615,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,Go on. We'll talk more later.
1616,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,"Jory, take her safely to her room."
1617,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room,"Come along, my Lady. You heard your father."
1618,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Arya s Room_2,How many guards does my father have?
1619,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Arya s Room_2,Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
1620,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Arya s Room_2,"You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
1621,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Arya s Room_2,"No fear on that count, little Lady."
1622,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room_1,Well?
1623,yoren,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room_1,"It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp."
1624,vardis egen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Vale,"You're far from home, Lady Stark."
1625,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Vale,To whom do I speak?
1626,vardis egen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Vale,"Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"
1627,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Vale,There was no time to send word.
1628,vardis egen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Vale,"May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?"
1629,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Vale,That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
1630,vardis egen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Vale,He doesn't look like a prisoner.
1631,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Vale,My sister will decide what he looks like.
1632,vardis egen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Vale,"Yes, my Lady. She will at that."
1633,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Vale,The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
1634,bronn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Vale,Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
1635,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Vale,I like you.
1636,steward,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Courtyard,"Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called."
1637,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Courtyard,I need to see the King first -- alone.
1638,steward,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Courtyard,"The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you."
1639,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Courtyard,Is it about my wife?
1640,steward,1,5,the wolf and the lion,King s Landing Courtyard,"No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."
1641,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,The whore is pregnant.
1642,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,You're speaking of murdering a child.
1643,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,"I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead."
1644,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
1645,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,"Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!"
1646,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,Then we're no better than the Mad King.
1647,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,"Careful, Ned. Careful now."
1648,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
1649,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,"No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child."
1650,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,Based on whose information?
1651,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
1652,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
1653,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,"Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."
1654,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,"He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?"
1655,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army  What then?
1656,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
1657,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
1658,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,"I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
1659,pycelle,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,"I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?"
1660,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,We should have had them both killed years ago.
1661,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,"When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it."
1662,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,"I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child."
1663,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,She dies.
1664,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,I will have no part in it.
1665,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,"You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will."
1666,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
1667,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Small Council s Chambers,"Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!"
1668,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room_2,I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
1669,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room_2,"Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you."
1670,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room_2,"His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned."
1671,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room_2,What can I do for you?
1672,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room_2,When do you return to Winterfell?
1673,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room_2,Why? What do you care?
1674,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room_2,"If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you."
1675,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room_2,I don't have the time.
1676,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room_2,It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
1677,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room_2,Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
1678,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room_2,Heward and Wyl.
1679,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Ned s Room_2,Find them and meet me at the stables.
1680,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,"You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, ""the seed is strong."" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale."
1681,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,"Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-"
1682,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
1683,robin arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,Mommy? Is that the bad man?
1684,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,It is.
1685,robin arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,He's little.
1686,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
1687,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
1688,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
1689,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,"If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do."
1690,robin arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,"You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!"
1691,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,"Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby."
1692,robin arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
1693,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,"Perhaps you will, my little love."
1694,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
1695,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,"Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord."
1696,mord,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The Eyrie,"You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!"
1697,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
1698,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,"Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man."
1699,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,You're jealous.
1700,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Are you sure this won't hurt?
1701,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Only if I slip.
1702,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,And you prefer me like this?
1703,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Mhmm.
1704,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,"If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy."
1705,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,I want you.
1706,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,"My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?"
1707,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Hold still.
1708,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,"All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood."
1709,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the m l e.
1710,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
1711,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,He shouldn't have entered the m l e if he didn't know how to fight.
1712,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
1713,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
1714,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,"I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you."
1715,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,"Yes well, I guess we'll never know."
1716,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Everywhere?
1717,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
1718,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,"It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
1719,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
1720,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,"He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money."
1721,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,I have an outrageous amount of money.
1722,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Not as much as the Lannisters.
1723,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,But a lot more than you.
1724,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,"Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King."
1725,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Hmm... How did that ever happen?
1726,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
1727,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Do you know who should be King?
1728,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Be serious.
1729,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,"I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you."
1730,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,I'm fourth in line.
1731,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
1732,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Stannis?
1733,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
1734,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,He's still my older brother.
1735,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,What are you doing?!
1736,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,Look at it.
1737,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,You cut me!
1738,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,"It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you."
1739,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Renly s Room,"You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King."
1740,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
1741,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
1742,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
1743,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
1744,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
1745,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."
1746,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
1747,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out."
1748,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,Is my father wrong?
1749,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."
1750,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,We still outnumber them.
1751,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
1752,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,Five.
1753,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."
1754,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,What do you want?
1755,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together."
1756,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,Our marriage.
1757,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?"
1758,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,Every day.
1759,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,How long can hate hold a thing together?
1760,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"Well, seventeen years is quite a long time."
1761,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"Yes, it is."
1762,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"Yes, it tis. What was she like?"
1763,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?"
1764,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
1765,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,So why now?
1766,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
1767,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind."
1768,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"I felt something for you once, you know?"
1769,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,I know.
1770,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,"Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?"
1771,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
1772,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,The King s Chambers,It doesn't make me feel anything.
1773,mhaegen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair."
1774,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,Aye.
1775,mhaegen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is."
1776,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,I will.
1777,mhaegen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me."
1778,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?"
1779,mhaegen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy."
1780,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
1781,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink."
1782,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
1783,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"Well, he has more than you, for a start."
1784,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,How many?
1785,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
1786,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
1787,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
1788,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,Come.
1789,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,Jory!
1790,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,My Lord.
1791,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,Such a small pack of wolves.
1792,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!"
1793,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
1794,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"What's the meaning of this, Lannister?"
1795,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."
1796,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,I remember him well.
1797,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?"
1798,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
1799,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
1800,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand."
1801,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,If you threaten my Lord again...
1802,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of ?"
1803,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"You kill me, your brother's a dead man."
1804,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
1805,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Baelish s Brothel_2,"My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back."
1806,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,"Your pardon, your Grace."
1807,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,Do you know what your wife has done?
1808,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,She did nothing I did not command.
1809,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,Who d have thought she had it in her?
1810,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
1811,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,I am the King s Hand -
1812,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,You were the King s Hand!
1813,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,- trying to keep the peace -
1814,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,You shall now be held accountable.
1815,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,"Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you ll make your peace with Jaime."
1816,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,He butchered my men.
1817,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
1818,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,"Quiet, woman."
1819,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
1820,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,I took you for a king.
1821,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,Hold your tongue.
1822,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,He s attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.
1823,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
1824,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,Wear it in silence or I ll honor you again.
1825,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not  That was not kingly.
1826,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,If we don t act  there will be a war.
1827,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,"So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King s Landing. She s had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it."
1828,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
1829,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,"I m half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don t know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don t want to know. This is what matters - I can t rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other s throats, so enough!"
1830,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,"As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight."
1831,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,"Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I m the king, I get what I want  I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it s true. You were the brother I chose. We ll talk when I return from the hunt."
1832,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,The hunt?
1833,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,Killing things clears my head. You ll have to sit on the throne while I m away. You ll hate it more than I do.
1834,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,The Targaryen girl -
1835,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Ned s Room_3,"Seven hells! Don t start with her again! The girl will die and I ll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I ll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister."

1842,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,Not now.
1843,theon greyjoy,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.
1844,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,You re talking about war.
1845,theon greyjoy,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,I m talking about justice.
1846,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
1847,theon greyjoy,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,A Lannister put his spear through your father s leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -
1848,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!
1849,theon greyjoy,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,You re not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They ve already started the war. It s your duty to represent your House when your father can t.
1850,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,"And it s not your duty, because it s not your House."
1851,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,Where s Bran?

1863,osha,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,the boy s worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark s own blood. Think what Mance would give us.
1865,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,Drop the knife. Let him go and I ll let you live.
1866,bran stark,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,Robb!

1873,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,Have you lost your mind? What if you d missed?
1874,theon greyjoy,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,He would have killed you and cut Bran s throat.
1875,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,You don t have the right -
1876,theon greyjoy,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,"To what, to save your brother s life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it."
1877,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Winterfell Woods,What about her?

I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I m not particularly good at violence, but I m good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle s boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and  I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"

1986,renly baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,"Woods, King s Landing","What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died?

1988,renly baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,"Woods, King s Landing",I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and  make the eight.

2257,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak","My Lady, you are from Westeros."
2258,doreah,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen. Khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.
2259,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",Princess.
2260,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.
2261,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",That? Dornish swill. Not worthy of a princess. I have a dry red from the Arbor. Nectar of the Gods. Let me give you a cask. Uh... a gift.
2262,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak","You honor me, Ser."
2263,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",The honor...the honor is all mine.
2264,rakharo,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak","Huh-uh, huh-uh."
2265,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak","You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess."
2266,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",I hope to repay your kindness someday.
2267,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",Rakharo.
2268,rakharo,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",Huh.
2269,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",Put down that cask.
2270,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",Is something wrong?
2271,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",I have a thirst. Open it.
2272,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.
2273,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",Open it.
2274,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",Pour.
2275,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.
2276,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",Do as he says.
2277,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",As the princess commands.
2278,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak","Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord. Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue."
2279,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",You first.
2280,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
2281,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",You will drink.
2282,doreah,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",Khaleesi! Stop him!
2283,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,"Market, Vaes Dothrak",Come.
2284,jeor mormont,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"You came to us as outlaws, poachers, rapers, killers, thieves. You came alone, in chains, without friends nor honor. You came to us rich and you came to us poor. Some of you bear the names of proud houses, others only bastard names or no names at all. It does not matter. All that, is in the past. Here, on the wall, are all one house. Tonight..."
2285,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,You're allowed to look happy. You're going to be a Ranger.
2286,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,I want to find my Uncle. I know he's alive out there. I know he is.
2287,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"I wish I could help you, but I'm no Ranger. It's the steward's life for me."
2288,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"There's honor in being a steward. Not much, really. But there's food."
2289,jeor mormont,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"Here you begin anew. A man of The Night's Watch lives his life for the realm. Not for a king, or a lord, or the honor of this house or that house. Not for gold nor glory nor a woman's love. But for the realm! And all the people in it. You've all learned the words of the vow. Think carefully before you say them. The penalty for desertion, is death. You can take your vows here tonight, at sunset. Do any of you still keep the old Gods?"
2290,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"I do, my lord."
2291,jeor mormont,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.
2292,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"Yes, my lord."
2293,jeor mormont,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall. And your old Gods too, maybe."
2294,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"my lord, might I go as well?"
2295,jeor mormont,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?
2296,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"No, my lord. I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him."
2297,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,The Night's Watch is my house now.
2298,jeor mormont,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"As you wish, lad. You've all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths. Halder to the builders. Pyp to the stewards. Toad to the builders. Grenn to the Rangers. Samwell to the stewards. Matthar to the Rangers. Dareon to the stewards. Balian to the Rangers. Rast to the Rangers. Jon to the stewards. Rancer to the builders. Echiel to the builders. Gordo to the stewards. Niko to the Rangers. Escan to the Rangers. Vorkoy to the builders. Joby to the stables. Mink to the kitchens. Allo to the builders. Nelugo to the Rangers. May all the Gods preserve you."
2299,jaremy rykker,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,Rangers with me.
2300,othell yarwyck,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,Builders!
2301,aemon,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library. Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens. Luke, report to one-eyed Joe in the stables. Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch. Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive. Make no comment about his nose. Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward."
2302,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.
2303,aemon,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers. Change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.
2304,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,Do you take me for a servant?
2305,aemon,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,We took you for a man of The Night's Watch. But perhaps we were wrong in that.
2306,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,May I go?
2307,aemon,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,As you wish.
2308,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?"
2309,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all. He wanted it and he got it."
2310,pypar,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock. I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver. So now I'm here. At the end of the world with no one to sing for, but old men and little shits like you. I'll never see my family again. I'll never be inside a woman again."
2311,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
2312,pypar,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
2313,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song."
2314,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch. You'll be with him day and night. Yes, you'll clean his clothes. But you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle. You'll know everything, be part of everything. And he asked for you himself. He wants to groom you for command."
2315,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger."
2316,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_3,"I always wanted to be a Wizard. What? No, I'm serious."
2317,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_4,"Lord Stark, a moment. Alone if you will."
2318,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_4,He named you Protector of the Realm
2319,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_4,Stark
2320,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_4,She won't care. Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.
2321,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_4,And what should I do with a hundred swords?
2322,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_4,"Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps. We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody. Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the King holds the Kingdom. Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare. By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us."
2323,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_4,What about Stannis?
2324,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_4,Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis? You have odd notions about protecting the realm.
2325,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_4,Stannis is your older brother.
2326,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_4,This isn't about the bloody line of succession. That didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now. What's best for the Kingdoms? What's best for the people we rule? We all know what Stannis is. He inspires no love or loyalty. He's not a King. I am.
2327,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_4,Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice. He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.
2328,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_4,"Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert. Tell me something"
2329,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_4,I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
2330,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,"You will sail to dragonstone tonight. You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon. Not his steward, not his Captain of the guard, and not his wife. Only Stannis himself."
2331,tomard,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,"Yes, My Lord."
2332,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,Now leave us.
2333,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,My Lord protector.
2334,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,The King has no true born sons. Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister's bastards.
2335,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,So when the King dies...
2336,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.
2337,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,So it would seem. Unless...
2338,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,"There is no ""unless"". He is the rightful heir. Nothing can change that."
2339,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,And he cannot take the throne without your help. You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.
2340,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,Do you have a shred of honor?
2341,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,"You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm. All of the power is yours. You need only reach out and take it. Make peace with the Lannisters. Release the Imp. Wed your daughter to Joffrey. We have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis. And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead."
2342,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,We?
2343,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,"You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest."
2344,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,What you suggest is treason.
2345,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,Only if we lose.
2346,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,"Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy."
2347,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,"We only make peace with our enemies, my Lord."
2348,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,No. I won't do it.
2349,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,So it will be Stannis and war?
2350,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,There is no other choice. He is the heir.
2351,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,"So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly."
2352,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,"You promised Catelyn you would help me. The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms. Enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard. I need the gold cloaks. The City Watch is 2,000 strong and sworn to defend the King's peace."
2353,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Ned s Room_5,Look at you. You know what you want me to do.
2355,othell yarwyck,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_4,You knelt as boys. Rise now as men of The Night's Watch.
2357,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_4,What's he got there?
2358,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,The Wall_4,Gods be good!
2359,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Tent Vaes Dothrak,What will they do to him?
2360,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Tent Vaes Dothrak,"When the Khalasar rides, he'll be leashed to a saddle, forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can."
2361,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Tent Vaes Dothrak,And when he falls?
2362,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Tent Vaes Dothrak,I saw a man last nine miles once.
2363,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Tent Vaes Dothrak,King Robert still wants me dead.
2364,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Tent Vaes Dothrak,This poisoner was the first. He won't be the last.
2365,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Tent Vaes Dothrak,"I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone."
2366,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Tent Vaes Dothrak,"He will never leave you alone. If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you. If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies would tell him. He will never abandon the hunt. You're a Targaryen. The last Targaryen. Your son will have Targaryen blood with 40,000 riders behind him."
2367,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Tent Vaes Dothrak,He will not have my son.
2368,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Tent Vaes Dothrak,"He will not have you either, Khaleesi."
2369,khal drogo,1,7,you win or you die,Tent Vaes Dothrak,Moon of my life. Are you hurt?
2370,khal drogo,1,7,you win or you die,Tent Vaes Dothrak,"Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did. Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.I make this gift to you. And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world. I will also pledge a gift.I will give him the iron chair, that his mother's father sat upon. I will give him Seven Kingdoms. I Drogo, will do this. I will take my Khalasar west to where the world ends and ride wooden horses across the black salt water as no Khal has done before. I will kill the men in iron suits and tear down their stone houses. I will rape their women, take their children as slaves and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak. This, I vow. I, Drogo, son of Bharbo. I swear before the Mother of Mountains as the stars look down in witness! As the stars look down in witness! The Khalasar is moving out of Vaes Dothrak, riding underneath the Horse Gate. Just as Jorah predicted, the wine merchant is leashed to one of the horses saddles, covered with dirt, struggling to move on."
2372,varly,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,Stop!
2373,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,"No, all right."
2375,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,King Joffrey?
2377,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,All is accomplished. The City Watch is yours.
2378,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,Good. Is Lord Renly joining us?
2379,varys,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,I fear Lord Renly has left the city. He rode through the old gate an hour before dawn with Ser Loras Tyrell and some 50 retainers.
2380,janos slynt,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,"We stand behind you, Lord Stark."
2382,joffrey baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation. I wish to be crowned within the fortnight. Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councilors.
2383,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,"Ser Barristan, I believe no man here could ever question your honor."
2384,barristan selmy,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,"King Robert's seal. Unbroken. ""Lord Eddard Stark is herein named Protector of the Realm, to rule as Regent until the heir come of age""."
2385,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,"May I see that letter, Ser Barristan? Protector of the realm. Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark? A piece of paper? Cersei shreds Robert's letter to pieces"
2386,barristan selmy,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,Those were the King's words.
2387,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,"We have a new King now. Lord Eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel. Allow me to return the courtesy. Bend the knee, My Lord. Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son and we shall allow you to live out your days in the gray waste you call home. Your son has no claim to the throne."
2388,joffrey baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,Liar!
2389,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,"You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark."
2390,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,"Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm."
2391,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,You think he stands alone?
2392,joffrey baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,"Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!"
2393,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,"Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody. Escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard."
2394,janos slynt,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,Men of the Watch!
2395,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,I want no bloodshed. Tell your men to lay down their swords. No one needs to die.
2396,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,Now!
2397,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,King s Landing_5,I did warn you not to trust me.
2398,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,"King's Landing,","Yah! Left high, left low."
2399,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,"King's Landing,","Right low, lunge right."

2401,mordane,1,8,the pointy end,Red Keep,Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
2402,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Red Keep,She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.
2403,mordane,1,8,the pointy end,Red Keep,Hush! Go back to your room.
2404,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Red Keep,What is it? What's happening?
2405,mordane,1,8,the pointy end,Red Keep,Do as I told you. Run!
2406,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,"This way! Left, right."
2407,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,"You said right, but you went left."
2408,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,And now you are a dead girl.
2409,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,Only 'cause you lied.
2410,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,My tongue lied.
2411,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,"I was so. I watched, but you..."
2412,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,"Watching is not seeing, dead girl."
2413,meryn trant,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,"Arya Stark, come with us."
2414,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? I am wondering.
2415,meryn trant,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,"Mind your place, dancing master."
2416,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,My father wouldn't send you.
2417,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
2418,meryn trant,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,Take her.
2419,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,"Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?"
2421,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,I am Syrio Forel.
2423,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
2424,meryn trant,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.
2425,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,"Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day."
2426,meryn trant,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,Bloody oafs.
2427,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,"Be gone now, Arya."
2428,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,Come with me. Run.
2429,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,The first sword of Braavos does not run.
2430,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,What do we say to the God of death?
2431,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,Not today.
2432,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,Go.
2433,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_6,Not today. Not today.
2434,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Red Keep_1,Stay away from me.
2435,sandor clegane,1,8,the pointy end,Red Keep_1,Who do you think sent me?
2436,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_7,Needle.
2437,stable boy,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_7,There she is.
2438,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_7,What do you want?
2439,stable boy,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_7,"I want you, wolf girl. Come here."
2440,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_7,Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
2441,stable boy,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_7,"She'll reward me, the Queen!"
2442,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing_7,Stay away!
2443,varys,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,"Lord Stark, you must be thirsty."
2444,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,Varys.
2445,varys,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,"I promise you it isn't poisoned. Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch? Not so much, My Lord. I would save the rest, if I were you. Hide it. Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells."
2446,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,What about my daughters?
2447,varys,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
2448,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,And Sansa?
2449,varys,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,Still engaged to Joffrey.
2450,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
2451,varys,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,"And would again, My Lord. I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords. When you look at me do you see a hero? What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?"
2452,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,The madness of mercy. That she might save her children.
2453,varys,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,"Ah, the children. It is always the innocents who suffer. It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar. The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King. I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?"
2454,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,The Queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother.
2455,varys,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,The wrong brother sadly. And lost to her. Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
2456,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,"If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it."
2457,varys,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,"Not today, My Lord."
2458,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,"Tell me something, Varys."
2459,varys,1,8,the pointy end,King s Landing Dungeon_1,"The Realm, My Lord. Someone must."
2460,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Blacck,"It's Othor, without a doubt."
2461,othell yarwyck,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Blacck,"The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off."
2462,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Blacck,Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
2463,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Blacck,"Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say."
2464,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Blacck,Mmm.
2465,samwell tarly,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Blacck,The smell.
2466,othell yarwyck,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Blacck,What smell?
2467,samwell tarly,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Blacck,"There is none.If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?"
2468,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Blacck,We should burn them.
2469,othell yarwyck,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Blacck,"Snow's not wrong, My Lord. Fire will do for them. The Wildling way."
2470,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Blacck,"I want Maester Aemon to examine them first. You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid. Get them inside."
2471,othell yarwyck,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Blacck,You heard him.
2472,alliser thorne,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Blacck,"Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers. A raven from King's Landing."
2474,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Jeor Mormont s chambers,"Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself. The King is dead."
2475,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Jeor Mormont s chambers,Is there any word of my father?
2476,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Jeor Mormont s chambers,Sit. Lord Stark has been charged with treason. They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
2477,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Jeor Mormont s chambers,I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid. Your duty lies here now.
2478,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Jeor Mormont s chambers,My sisters were in King's Landing too.
2479,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Jeor Mormont s chambers,I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
2480,varys,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,"Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear."
2481,pycelle,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
2482,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,"He wouldn't do that. He knows how much I love Joffrey. He wouldn't. Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake. Send for my father. He'll tell you, the King was his friend."
2483,cersei lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,"Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong. We know that. Yet you are the daughter of a traitor. How can I allow you to marry my son?"
2484,pycelle,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,"A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King. She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?"
2485,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,"No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see. I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise. I won't hatch anything."
2486,petyr baelish,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,"The girl is innocent, Your Grace. She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty."
2487,cersei lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,"Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest. What's his name?"
2488,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,Robb.
2489,cersei lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,"Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt. Best it comes from you. If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace. Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey."
2490,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,"If...if I could see my father, talk to him about..."
2491,cersei lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,"You disappoint me, child. We have told you of your father's treason. Why would you want to speak to a traitor?"
2492,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,I only meant that...what will happen to him?
2493,cersei lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,That depends.
2494,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,On...on what?
2495,cersei lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The Red Keep,On your brother. And on you.
2496,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_11,Treason? Sansa wrote this?
2497,luwin,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_11,"It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words. You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King."
2498,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_11,"Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?"
2499,luwin,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_11,"This is a royal command, My Lord. If you should refuse to obey..."
2500,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_11,"I won't refuse. His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing. But not alone. Call the banners."
2501,luwin,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_11,"All of them, My Lord?"
2502,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_11,"They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?"
2503,luwin,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_11,They have.
2505,luwin,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_11,Yeah.
2506,theon greyjoy,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_11,Are you afraid?
2507,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_11,I must be.
2508,theon greyjoy,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_11,Good.
2509,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_11,Why is that good?
2510,theon greyjoy,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_11,It means you're not stupid.
2511,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,You've had this since dawn?
2512,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,"He sent it to me, not you. I've only shown it to you as a courtesy."
2513,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,A courtesy?! My husband has been taken prisoner. My son intends to declare war.
2514,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,A war? Your son against the Lannisters? You should go to him. Teach him patience.
2515,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience? He is your brother by law! Does family mean nothing to you?
2516,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,Family means everything to me.
2517,robin arryn,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,I'm hungry.
2518,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,"Hush now, darling. You just ate."
2519,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?
2520,robin arryn,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,But I'm hungry!
2521,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,"Soon, love, soon. You're always welcome here, sister. But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight..."
2522,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,That is what I ask.
2523,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,"Go on, sweet. Time for your bath. I'll feed you after."
2524,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,If you fear for the safety of your son...
2525,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,Of course I fear for the safety of my son! Are you an idiot? They killed my husband. You say they shoved your boy from a window. These people will do anything.
2526,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,And that is why we have to stop them.
2527,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,The Eyrie_1,"The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord."
2528,bronn,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale,Will you shut up? There's hill tribes all around here.
2529,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale,"If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart."
2530,bronn,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale,I should just take your food and leave you here.
2531,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale,"Starve, most likely."
2532,bronn,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale,"You don't think I'd do it, do you?"
2533,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale,"What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women? Golden women? Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer. But you knew that. That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor."
2534,bronn,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale,"Fair enough. But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and ""My Lord"" you every time you take a shit. I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend."
2535,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale,Though I would treasure your friendship. I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder. And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out. Remember this
2536,bronn,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale_1,Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion.
2537,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale_1,"Come, share our fire. Help yourselves to our goat."
2538,shagga,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale_1,"When you meet your Gods, you tell them Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you."
2539,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale_1,I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
2540,shagga,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale_1,"How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?"
2541,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale_1,"In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock."
2542,shagga,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale_1,Take the half man. He can dance for the children. Kill the other one.
2543,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale_1,"No no no no no! My, my House is rich and powerful. If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold."
2544,shagga,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale_1,We have no use for a half man's promises.
2545,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale_1,"Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies. What do the Stone Crows do? Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by? Are those the best weapons you could steal? Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back. Lannister smiths shit better steel."
2546,shagga,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale_1,You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
2547,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale_1,"That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns. But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf, I will not give you trinkets. I will give you this."
2548,shagga,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale_1,"What is ""this""?"
2549,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,The hills of the Vale_1,The Vale of Arryn. The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes. The Lords of the Vale want me dead. I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.

2552,alliser thorne,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Black s kitchen,"Blood will always tell. You'll hang for this, bastard."
2553,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Black s kitchen,I told you not to do anything stupid. You're confined to quarters. Go.
2554,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Black s kitchen,"Ghost, what's wrong? Is something out there?"

2561,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,What did they do?
2562,rakharo,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,Lamb men make good slaves. Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers. And the slavers will give us gold...and silk and steel.
2563,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
2564,jorah mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"Gold to hire ships, Princess. Ships to sail to Westeros. While walking a little further, Dany sees Dothraki men looting and holding Lhazareen captive."
2565,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"Jorah, make them stop."
2566,jorah mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,Khaleesi?
2567,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,You heard me.
2568,jorah mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,These men have shed blood for their Khal. Now they claim their rewards.
2569,rakharo,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi. The riders do her honor. If her wailing offends the Khaleesi, I will bring you her tongue."
2570,jorah mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been."
2571,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"I do not have a gentle heart, Ser. Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why."
2572,rakharo,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"Kash qoy qoyi thira disse. Me qorasokh anni! While Rhakharo argues with a Dothraki man, Jorah brings over a Lhazareen woman."

2575,jorah mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,What do you want done with them?
2576,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,Bring her to me. And those women there.
2577,jorah mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"You cannot claim them all, Princess."

2581,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"Moon of my life. Mago says you have taken his spoils. A daughter of a lamb men, who was his to mount. Tell me the truth of this."
2582,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars. I have claimed many daughters this day, so they cannot be mounted."
2583,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,This is the way of war. These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
2584,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"It pleases me to keep them safe. If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wifes."
2585,qotho,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,Does the horse mate with the lamb?
2586,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,The dragons feeds on horse and lamb alike.
2587,mago,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,You are a foreigner. You do not command me.
2588,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,I am Khaleesi. I do command you.
2589,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"See how fierce she grows? That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world. Filling her with his fire. I will hear no more. Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock."
2590,mago,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
2591,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,Ohosa. Os. I will not have your body burned. I will not give you that honor.
2592,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,The beetles will feed on your eyes. The worms will crawl through your lungs.
2593,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,The rain will fall on your rotting skin...
2594,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,Until nothing is left of you but bones!
2595,mago,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,First you have to kill me!
2596,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,My sun and stars is wounded.
2597,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"A scratch, moon of my life."
2598,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,Where are the healers?
2599,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,This is the bite of a fly.
2600,mirri maz duur,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,I can help the great rider with his cut.
2601,qotho,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.

2603,mirri maz duur,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"Thank you, silver lady."
2604,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,Who are you?
2605,mirri maz duur,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,I am named Mirri Maz Duur. I was the Godswife of this Temple.
2606,qotho,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,A witch. And spits on the ground.
2607,mirri maz duur,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"My mother was Godswife here before me. She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments. All men are of one flock, so my people believe. The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his..."
2608,qotho,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,Too many words. A witch's words poison the ears.
2609,mirri maz duur,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester."
2610,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Lhazar,"Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars. It makes me hurt to see you bleed."
2611,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_12,"For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy. I'm the man you want leading the Vanguard."
2612,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_12,Galbart Glover will lead the Van.
2613,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_12,The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover. I will lead the Van or I will take my men and march them home.
2614,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_12,"You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber. And when I am done with the Lannisters, I will march back North, root you out of your Keep and hang you for an oathbreaker."
2615,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_12,"Oathbreaker, is it?!"
2616,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_12,I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
2617,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_12,My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord. But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
2618,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_12,Your meat...is bloody tough.
2619,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Brann s Room_5,What is it? What's happened?
2620,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Brann s Room_5,"Shh, it's all right."
2621,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Brann s Room_5,Where are you going?
2622,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Brann s Room_5,South. For father.
2623,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Brann s Room_5,But it's the middle of the night.
2624,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Brann s Room_5,The Lannisters have spies everywhere. I don't want them to know we're coming.
2625,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Brann s Room_5,They have more men than we do.
2626,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Brann s Room_5,"Aye, they do."
2627,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Brann s Room_5,"Can't I come with you? I can ride now. You've seen me riding. And I won't get in the way, I..."
2628,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Brann s Room_5,There must always be a Stark at Winterfell. Until I return that will be you. You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone. Do you understand? Listen to Maester Luwin. Look after your little brother.
2629,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Brann s Room_5,I will.

2636,osha,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_13,"You hear them, boy? The Old Gods are answering you."
2637,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_13,What are you doing here?
2638,osha,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_13,"They're my Gods too. Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods. Even slaves are allowed to pray."
2639,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_13,You're not a slave.
2640,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_13,"Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat."

2642,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_13,What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
2643,osha,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_13,"You asked them, they're answering you. Shh. Open your ears."
2644,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_13,It's only the wind.
2645,osha,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_13,"Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods? They see you, boy. They hear you. Your brother will get no help from them where he's going. The Old Gods have no power in the South. The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago. How can they watch when they have no eyes?"
2646,osha,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_13,"Well, there's a big man. He has giants blood in him or I'm the Queen."
2647,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_13,"Go back and find your clothes, Hodor. Go dress."
2648,hodor,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_13,Hodor.
2649,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_13,Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
2650,osha,1,8,the pointy end,Winterfell_13,"Giants and worse than giants. I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way. All these swords, they should be going North, boy. North, not south! The cold winds are rising."

2652,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Black_3,How do you know that?
2653,samwell tarly,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Black_3,I read about it in a book. A very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
2654,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Black_3,What else did the book say?
2655,samwell tarly,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Black_3,The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years. And when they wake up...
2656,pypar,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Black_3,"And when they wake up, what?"
2657,samwell tarly,1,8,the pointy end,Castle Black_3,I hope The Wall is high enough.

2666,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,"I had not thought to be here. I would speak with my son alone. I know you will forgive me, My Lords."
2667,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,"You heard her! Move your asses! Come on, out. You too, Greyjoy. Are you bloody deaf? Have no fear, My Lady. We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned. You old devil, Rodrik."
2668,rodrik cassel,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,Jon.
2669,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,"You're not wasting away, are you? As soon as the men left, Catelyn hugs Robb."
2670,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.And now I find you leading a host to war.
2671,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,There was no one else.
2672,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,No one? Who were those men I saw here?
2673,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,None of them are Starks.
2674,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,All of them are seasoned in battle.
2675,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
2676,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,"Oh, would that I could."
2677,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,There was a letter. From Sansa.
2678,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,"From the Queen, you mean. There's no mention of Arya."
2679,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,No.
2680,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,How many men do you have?
2681,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,"18,000. If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey..."
2682,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,"you would never be allowed to leave. No. Our best hope, our only hope, is that you can defeat them in the field."
2683,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,And if I lose?
2684,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,"Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children, when the Mad King fell?"
2685,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,They were butchered in their sleep.
2686,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,"On the orders of Tywin Lannister. And the years have not made him kinder. If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die."
2687,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,"Well, that makes it simple then."
2688,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark Camp,I suppose it does.
2689,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Lannister camp,From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
2690,shagga,1,8,the pointy end,Lannister camp,Best for Tyrion son of Tywin. Not best for me.

2693,tywin lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Lannister camp,The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
2694,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Lannister camp,Sorry to disappoint you.
2695,tywin lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Lannister camp,And who are these Companions of yours?
2696,tywin lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Lannister camp,"This is Shagga Son of Dolf, Chieftain of the Stone Crows. Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men. This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears. And here we have Bronn son of..."

2698,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Lannister camp,"May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister. Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West. Kind of you to go to war for me."
2699,tywin lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Lannister camp,You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake. Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.

2709,tywin lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Lannister camp,A green boy. One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs.
2710,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Lannister camp,"Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence. You'd like him. While we're on the subject of war, I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts. We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces..."

2716,rodrik cassel,1,8,the pointy end,Stark camp,"The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north. We need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage."
2717,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Stark camp,"No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun. Do that and the River Lords will join us."
2718,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark camp,To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
2719,theon greyjoy,1,8,the pointy end,Stark camp,Lord Frey controls that bridge. Your father's bannerman.
2720,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Stark camp,"""The late Lord Frey"" my father calls him. At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done. Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others. Meanwhile, outside a few Stark men captured a scout, leading him to Robbs tent."
2721,theon greyjoy,1,8,the pointy end,Stark camp,Robb's right. We need that bridge.
2722,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Stark camp,So what's it gonna be? Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
2724,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Stark camp,"Don't worry, lad. He won't be leaving this tent with his head."

He was King Robert's friend and he loved him. You all know he loved him. He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him. They must have lied to him. Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody. They must have lied!"
2769,joffrey baratheon,1,8,the pointy end,Kings Landing,He said I wasn't the King. Why did he say that?
2770,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Kings Landing,He was badly hurt. Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy. He wasn't himself. Otherwise he never would have said it.

2828,jeor mormont,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_4,"Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it."
2829,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_4,l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
2830,jeor mormont,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_4,"No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist   l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper."
2831,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_4,"Yes, my lord."
2835,pypar,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,"Go on, let's have a look."
2836,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,At what?
2837,grenn,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,The sword! Show us the sword.
2839,pypar,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,Let's have a look.
2840,grenn,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,Piss off.
2841,pypar,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,"Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!"
2842,grenn,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,Look at its eyes.
2843,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,What is it?
2844,samwell tarly,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,l - l can't.
2845,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,You can't what?
2846,samwell tarly,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,l'm really not supposed to say.
2847,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,And yet you really want to say. You want to say that
2848,samwell tarly,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
2849,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,What? What about him?
2850,samwell tarly,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,"He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe."
2851,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black Mess Hall_3,l should be there. l should be with him.
2852,greatjon umber,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1","lf we do that, they'll never get back across."
2853,robb stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",Well? What did he say?
2854,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1","Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well."
2855,robb stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",Huh.
2856,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
2857,robb stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",What does he want in return?
2858,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
2859,robb stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1","Fine, fine. And?"
2860,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
2861,robb stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",She won't be happy about that. And?
2862,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.
2863,robb stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
2864,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",l did.
2865,robb stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",And?
2866,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",One was   Do you consent?
2867,robb stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",Can l refuse?
2868,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",Not if you want to cross.
2869,robb stark,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Stark Camp_1",Then l consent.
2870,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,Sam said you wanted to see me?
2871,aemon,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,"l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?"
2872,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,No.
2873,aemon,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,"So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?"
2874,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,"He would do whatever was right, no matter what."
2875,aemon,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,"Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?"
2876,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,Sam told you.
2877,aemon,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,"We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose."
2878,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
2879,aemon,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,"Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know."
2880,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,"You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother."
2881,aemon,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South
2882,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,Who are you?
2883,aemon,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,"My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King."
2884,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,You're Aemon Targaryen.
2885,aemon,1,9,baelor,Castle Black_5,"l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have."

2890,qotho,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea,(in Dothraki) He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
2891,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea,"(in Dothraki) He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here."
2892,qotho,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea,(in Dothraki) This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
2893,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea,(in Dothraki) We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
2894,qotho,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea,"(in Dothraki) You do not command me, Khaleesi."
2895,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea,(in Dothraki) Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
2896,qotho,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea,"(in Dothraki) The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi."
2897,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea,(in Dothraki) Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.

2902,tywin lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Lannister Camp_1","l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them."
2903,kevan lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Lannister Camp_1","The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided."
2904,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Lannister Camp_1",Shagga likes axes.
2905,tywin lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Lannister Camp_1","When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard."
2906,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Lannister Camp_1",The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
2907,kevan lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Lannister Camp_1",They do seem rather ferocious.
2908,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Lannister Camp_1","Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."
2909,tywin lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Lannister Camp_1","When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander."
2910,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Lannister Camp_1",Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
2911,tywin lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Lannister Camp_1",There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
2912,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tent, Lannister Camp_1","lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords."

2916,bronn,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp","From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down."
2917,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp",And he didn't have anything to say about it?
2918,bronn,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp",He said something.

And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."

2938,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
2939,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,"He will die tonight, Khaleesi."
2940,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,He can't. He can't. l won't let him.
2941,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
2942,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,l won't leave him.
2943,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,"He's already gone, Khaleesi."
2944,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,"Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo."
2945,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,"This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs."
2946,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,l won't leave him.

2961,mirri maz duur,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.

2965,mirri maz duur,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.

2967,mirri maz duur,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,"No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse."
2968,rakharo,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,"Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch."

2975,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,No one will enter.
2976,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,"Bring him back to me. Daenerys leaves the tent as the horse collapses to the ground, dead. Jorah comes to her. What have you done?"
2977,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,l have to save him.
2978,qotho,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,(in Dothraki) This must not be.
2979,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,(in Dothraki) This must be.

2989,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,Fetch the midwives.
2990,rakharo,1,9,baelor,Across the Narrow Sea_1,They will not come. They say she is cursed.

3003,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."

3005,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",l happen to be a great judge of character.
3006,bronn,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",This sounds like a boring game.
3007,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying."
3008,shae,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",l don't want to play this game.

3018,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
3019,shae,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",Drink.
3020,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."

3025,bronn,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
3026,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","So, specifics  You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
3027,shae,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",Drink.
3028,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",Are you sure
3029,shae,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head."
3030,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize."
3031,shae,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",My turn.
3032,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
3033,shae,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",Who were you in love with?
3034,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",That's not how the game works.
3035,shae,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",l don't care the way the game works.
3036,bronn,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",Our lord here used to be married.
3037,shae,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",Married?
3038,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",How did you hear that?
3039,bronn,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
3040,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","Another night, perhaps."
3041,shae,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",Not another night. This night.
3042,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",lt's not a pleasant story.
3043,shae,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","Oh, maybe l will cry."
3044,bronn,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
3045,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
3046,bronn,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","For three chickens, l should hope so."
3047,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
3048,bronn,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."
3049,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
3050,bronn,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",l would have killed the man who did that to me.
3051,shae,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",You should have known she was a whore.
3052,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."
3053,shae,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
3054,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","As l said, l was young and stupid."
3055,shae,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",You are still young and stupid.
3056,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",What is it? What do you want?
3057,bronn,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",You're sleeping through the war.
3058,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",What?
3059,bronn,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.

3061,bronn,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",You don't have a squire.

3082,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",Good of you to notice. l hear we won.
3083,tywin lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand]."
3084,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1","Did we get the Stark boy, at least?"
3085,tywin lannister,1,9,baelor,"Tyrion s Tent, Lannister Camp_1",He wasn't here.

3105,robb stark,1,9,baelor,The Eyrie_2,Aye. But the dead won't hear them. (making a speech to his bannermen) One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
3106,arya stark,1,9,baelor,King s Landing_8,Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.

Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say"
3120,pycelle,1,9,baelor,King s Landing_8,"As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?"

3219,catelyn stark,1,10,fire and blood,"Dungeons, Stark Camp",Because of men like you.
3220,jaime lannister,1,10,fire and blood,"Dungeons, Stark Camp",There are no men like me. Only me.

3222,jaime lannister,1,10,fire and blood,"Dungeons, Stark Camp",l pushed him out the window.
3223,catelyn stark,1,10,fire and blood,"Dungeons, Stark Camp",Why?
3224,jaime lannister,1,10,fire and blood,"Dungeons, Stark Camp",I hoped the fall would kill him.

3234,tyrion lannister,1,10,fire and blood,"Tent, Lannister Camp_2",There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning   in case you hadn't noticed.
3235,kevan lannister,1,10,fire and blood,"Tent, Lannister Camp_2",l'm told we still have his sisters.

You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now   madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong."
3239,tyrion lannister,1,10,fire and blood,"Tent, Lannister Camp_2","Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here."
3240,tywin lannister,1,10,fire and blood,"Tent, Lannister Camp_2",No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
3241,tyrion lannister,1,10,fire and blood,"Tent, Lannister Camp_2",And do what?
3242,tywin lannister,1,10,fire and blood,"Tent, Lannister Camp_2","Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest   Baelish, Varys, Pycelle"
3243,tyrion lannister,1,10,fire and blood,"Tent, Lannister Camp_2","Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?"

Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?"

3403,sansa stark,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,"It was well struck, Your Grace."
3404,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,I already said it was well struck.
3405,sansa stark,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,"Yes, Your Grace."

3418,sansa stark,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,You can't!
3419,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,What did you say? Did you say I can't?
3420,sansa stark,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,I only meant… it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
3421,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...
3422,sandor clegane,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,"The girl is right. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year."
3423,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,"(Sighs). Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool."
3424,sansa stark,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,He is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.

3432,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,We heard you were dead.

3436,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.
3437,sansa stark,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,"My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey."
3438,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,Of course you are.
3439,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,"Well, (Gulps down his wine), enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done."
3440,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING,What work? (Bronn and the tribesmen follow Tyrion. Joffrey stands up). Why are you here?

3442,varys,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,"The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter."

3447,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,"I do, Your Grace."
3448,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,And are you not a Lord at my command?

3450,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,"Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital."

3454,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,"(Sits down) It's been a remarkable journey. I, (grabs a glass), pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. (Pours himself wine). I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for."
3455,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,What are you doing here? This is the small council.
3456,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,"Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings."
3457,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,Our father is Hand of the King.

3460,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,Out! All of you out. (The small council members all get up and leave until it is only Cersei and Tyrion. Cersei stands up and approaches Tyrion). I would like to know how you tricked father into this.
3461,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,"If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. (Cersei sits down)."
3462,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,I've done nothing.
3463,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
3464,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,I tried to stop it.
3465,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.

3467,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
3468,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,What do you know about warfare?
3469,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
3470,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,Joffrey is King.
3471,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,Joffrey is King.
3472,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,You are here to advise him.
3473,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,"I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back."
3474,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,How?
3475,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
3476,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,One.
3477,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,One?

3479,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER,"Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child."

3486,bran stark,2,11,the north remembers,INSIDE WINTERFELL’S KEEP,"Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?"
3488,luwin,2,11,the north remembers,INSIDE WINTERFELL’S KEEP,"We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?"
3490,luwin,2,11,the north remembers,INSIDE WINTERFELL’S KEEP,"We didn't want him here all day, did we?"
3491,bran stark,2,11,the north remembers,INSIDE WINTERFELL’S KEEP,I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
3492,luwin,2,11,the north remembers,INSIDE WINTERFELL’S KEEP,Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. (Bran sighs). Lord Portan.

3501,bran stark,2,11,the north remembers,WOODS - LATER THAT DAY,I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. (Bran looks up at the comet). They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
3502,osha,2,11,the north remembers,WOODS - LATER THAT DAY,"Did they? (Hodor is kneeling next to the pool in the godswood. Osha begins unstrapping Bran from Hodor’s back). I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father."
3503,osha,2,11,the north remembers,WOODS - LATER THAT DAY,"The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons."

3522,daenerys targaryen,2,11,the north remembers,DESERT,"(Speaking Dothraki) Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."

3568,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,CRASTER’S LODGE,And where does he plan marching this army?
3569,craster,2,11,the north remembers,CRASTER’S LODGE,"When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go."
3570,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,CRASTER’S LODGE,These are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.
3571,craster,2,11,the north remembers,CRASTER’S LODGE,"Let them come. My roots are sunk deep. (Grabs Gilly) Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are."
3572,gilly,2,11,the north remembers,CRASTER’S LODGE,This is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave.
3573,craster,2,11,the north remembers,CRASTER’S LODGE,"Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?"
3574,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,CRASTER’S LODGE,We chose different paths.
3575,craster,2,11,the north remembers,CRASTER’S LODGE,"Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. (Stands up).  You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs."
3576,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,CRASTER’S LODGE,(Stands up) A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you.
3577,craster,2,11,the north remembers,CRASTER’S LODGE,"(Addressing the group). Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one, (Gestures towards Jon),  staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out."
3578,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,CRASTER’S LODGE,"Your roof, your rules."
3579,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,IN THE CAMP,(Angrily) Who am I? (Jon looks confused) Who am I?
3580,jon snow,2,11,the north remembers,IN THE CAMP,Lord commander.
3581,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,IN THE CAMP,And who are you?
3582,jon snow,2,11,the north remembers,IN THE CAMP,Jon Snow.
3583,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,IN THE CAMP,Who are you?
3584,jon snow,2,11,the north remembers,IN THE CAMP,Your steward.
3585,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,IN THE CAMP,You want to lead one day? (Jon nods). Then learn how to follow.
3586,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,"Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false Gods."
3587,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors.
3589,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,"After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world. Stars will bleed."
3590,cressen,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,(To Davos) We need to stop her!
3591,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas.
3592,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,(Looks to Stannis) Not now.
3593,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,And the dead shall rise in the North.
3594,cressen,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,"(Walks forward, interrupting Melisandre). All you men were named in the Light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?"
3595,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,"You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me."
3596,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,"In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you."
3598,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
3599,stannis baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,For the night is dark and full of terror.
3600,cressen,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.
3601,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,"Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path."
3602,cressen,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,"(Scoffs) King. Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation."
3603,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.
3604,cressen,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,"As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos. (Davos picks up the sword and inspects it).  If you tell him the truth…"
3605,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,BEACH,What's the truth?
3606,matthos,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,“And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert le-”
3607,stannis baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,"He wasn't my beloved brother. (Matthos looks up). I didn't love him, he didn't love me."
3608,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,"A harmless courtesy, Your Grace."
3609,stannis baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,A lie. Take it out.
3610,matthos,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,"“That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs; the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella, being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth -"""
3611,stannis baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,"Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Call him what he is."
3612,matthos,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,"""And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim -"""
3613,stannis baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,"Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight."
3614,matthos,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,"(Adding Ser) ""Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros. (Stannis nods). Let all true men declare their loyalty.”"
3615,stannis baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,"When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse."
3616,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,"Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -"
3617,stannis baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.
3618,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,"Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly."
3619,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him.
3620,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
3621,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,He has no need for ships.
3622,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,"I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark."
3623,stannis baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,"Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them."
3624,cressen,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,"(Stands up). I owe you an apology, my King. My duty is to serve. You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods. May the Lord of Light watch over us all. Shall we drink together?"
3625,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,(Whispers to Cressen) Don't.
3626,cressen,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,A cup of wine to honor the one true God.
3627,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY,"The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away. Your Grace."
3628,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,"King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl."
3629,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,"If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, ""Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.”"
3630,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
3631,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,"Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours."
3632,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy’? Insulted?
3633,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,"You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy."
3634,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. (Grey Wind enters the cage. Jaime looks very nervous). Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. (Jaime focuses back on Robb). He's your bastard son.
3635,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,"If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him."
3636,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.
3637,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
3638,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.
3639,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
3640,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
3641,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
3642,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,"No, but he's starting to know me."
3643,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,Three victories don't make you a conqueror.
3644,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,STARK CAMP,It's better than three defeats.
3645,shae,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,This city stinks Like dead bodies.
3646,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,"A bit corpsey, yes."
3647,shae,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,And shit.
3648,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,I thought you wanted to come here.
3649,shae,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,I love it.
3650,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
3651,shae,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,And cum and garlic and rum.
3652,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,You can smell cum from the balcony?
3653,shae,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.
3654,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,And so did the country.
3655,shae,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,This is where I belong.
3656,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,"Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here."
3657,shae,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,No one will know.
3658,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,"You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars."
3659,shae,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,What about you?
3660,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
3661,shae,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,Truth? (Laughs) You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.
3662,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,"Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, (Lays down on the bed with Shae), crushed beneath the weight of all that truth."
3663,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,TYRION’S ROOM,"Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here."
3664,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,Lord Baelish.
3665,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,Your Grace.
3666,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
3667,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,"Of course, Your Grace."
3668,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.
3669,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,"If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination."
3670,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
3671,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,Curious.
3672,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,"If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts."
3673,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,"Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. (Smiles) Who knows what they want?"
3674,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,"A mockingbird. (Points to a pin on Baelish’s shirt). You created your own Sigil, didn't you?"
3675,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,Yes.
3676,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
3677,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
3678,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,"I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another."
3679,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,"When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found."
3680,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,And which truth is that?
3681,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,Knowledge is power.
3682,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,HALLWAY,Seize him. (Cersei’s guards seize Baelish). Cut his throat. (A guard holds a knife to Baelish’s neck). Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. (The guards let Baelish go). Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. (The guards do as Cersei says). (To Baelish) Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.
3683,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,You're Ser Alton Lannister?
3684,alton lannister,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,"I am, Your Grace."
3685,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,"I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals."
3686,alton lannister,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,"An honorable request, Your Grace."
3687,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,"Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom."
3688,rodrik cassel,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,The King in the North.
3690,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,"Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me."
3691,alton lannister,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,"These are... Your Grace, these are..."
3692,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,"These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead."
3693,alton lannister,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,"King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace."
3694,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,"Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight."
3695,theon greyjoy,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,"A word, Your Grace?"
3696,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace’ when no one's around.
3697,theon greyjoy,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,It's not so bad once you get used to it.
3698,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
3699,theon greyjoy,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,"The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?"
3700,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,Of course they are.
3701,theon greyjoy,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,"We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them."
3702,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,Men who fought my father.
3703,theon greyjoy,2,11,the north remembers,ROBB’S TENT,"Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together."
3704,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
3705,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,I need his ships. They say he has 200.
3706,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?
3707,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
3708,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
3709,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,"Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another."
3710,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,"I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten."
3711,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,"If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet."
3712,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,"You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?"
3713,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,It's more complicated than that! You know it is.
3714,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
3715,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,You can't go to Winterfell.
3716,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,I beg your pardon?
3717,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,"I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands."
3718,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,Why in the name of all the Gods -
3719,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,"Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family."
3720,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -
3721,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,"Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good."
3722,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,I will ride at first light.
3723,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,"We will all be together again soon, I promise."
3724,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,You've done so well. Your father would be proud.
3725,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,(Pauses) Give Lord Renly my regards.
3726,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER,King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.
3727,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,What is all this?
3728,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,"Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers."
3729,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,We can't find Arya Stark.
3730,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,"With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere."
3731,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,"Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone."
3732,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. (Walks towards the throne).
3733,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
3734,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.
3735,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,His life is in danger.
3736,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.
3737,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
3738,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
3739,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
3740,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
3741,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,What are you asking?
3742,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -
3743,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,THRONE ROOM,"What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. (Joffrey begins to walk away). That will be all, Mother."
3744,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,"No, no, no, no. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Ease into it. Slowly, with passion."
3745,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on. Both of you are working tonight.
3746,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,"We do things differently here, Daisy. This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall."
3747,daisy,2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,Haystack Hall.
3748,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,Wherever you're from. Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders. (Nods to a man walking past). Lord Olsen. Taste is everything here.
3749,daisy,2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,Littlefinger's a fancy man.
3750,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,"Don't call him Littlefinger, he doesn't like it. Lord Baelish."
3751,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.
3752,daisy,2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,She's beautiful.
3753,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,"She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot. (Janos enters the room). Lord Commander. Good to see you, again."
3754,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,"You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin. Coin which goes in many pockets."
3755,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,Orders.
3756,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,Whose orders?
3757,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.
3758,mhaegen,2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,"No, you can't!"
3759,mhaegen,2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,No! Please! No! Not my Barra! Please. Please.
3760,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,Enough. Get it done. Kill the bastard.
3761,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,BROTHEL,Give it here.
3762,gold cloak,2,11,the north remembers,A DOCK,"Spread out! Search every house, every room. Look in every room."
3763,blacksmith,2,11,the north remembers,SMITHY,Gendry! His name is Gendry.
3764,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,SMITHY,Where is the bastard?
3765,blacksmith,2,11,the north remembers,SMITHY,"The Night's Watch! Please, stop!"
3766,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,SMITHY,Where?
3767,blacksmith,2,11,the north remembers,SMITHY,"They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north!"
3768,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,SMITHY,How will we know him?
3769,blacksmith,2,11,the north remembers,SMITHY,He's got a bull's head helmet. He made it himself.
3770,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,SMITHY,Find him.
3771,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,What are you doing here?
3772,varys,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,Your father has named Lord Tyrion to (Cersei scoffs) serve as hand in his stead.
3773,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,You brought this on yourself.
3774,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,I’ve done nothing.
3775,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,Do you understand we’re losing the war?
3776,daenerys targaryen,2,12,the night lands,DESERT_1,Does it ever end?
3777,jorah mormont,2,12,the night lands,DESERT_1,"Everything ends, even the red waste."
3778,daenerys targaryen,2,12,the night lands,DESERT_1,"(Speaking Dothraki) Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.. Take our remaining horses. Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."
3779,eddison tollett,2,12,the night lands,/EXT. CRASTER’S CAMP,All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster’s still here.
3780,craster,2,12,the night lands,/EXT. CRASTER’S CAMP,"Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand."
3781,eddison tollett,2,12,the night lands,/EXT. CRASTER’S CAMP,"He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters."
3782,matthos,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_1,"(Reading a letter) My brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, the boy Joffrey being born of incest between Cersei Lannister, and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth, and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros."
3783,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_1,Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm.
3784,robb stark,2,12,the night lands,STARK CAMP_1,I’m sending one of your cousins down to King’s Landing with my peace terms.
3785,jaime lannister,2,12,the night lands,STARK CAMP_1,You think my father’s going to negotiate with you? You don’t know him very well.
3786,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,STARK CAMP_1,"We won’t beat them until we take King’s Landing, and we can’t take King’s Landing without ships. My father has ships, and men who know how to sail them."
3787,robb stark,2,12,the night lands,STARK CAMP_1,Men who fought my father.
3788,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,STARK CAMP_1,I’m his only living son. He’ll listen to me.
3789,catelyn stark,2,12,the night lands,STARK CAMP_1,You don’t want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
3790,robb stark,2,12,the night lands,STARK CAMP_1,I need his ships.
3791,catelyn stark,2,12,the night lands,STARK CAMP_1,He is not trustworthy!
3792,joffrey baratheon,2,12,the night lands,THRONE ROOM_1,I heard a disgusting lie about uncle Jaime… and you. Father had other children?
3793,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,THRONE ROOM_1,What are you asking?
3794,joffrey baratheon,2,12,the night lands,BROTHEL_1,How many bastards does he have running around?
3795,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,Where is the bastard?
3796,blacksmith,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,The Night’s Watch! Heading North!
3797,jaqen h'ghar,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,(Whispers) Boy.
3798,jaqen h'ghar,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,(Whispers) Lovely boy.
3799,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,(Stops walking). What do you want?
3800,jaqen h'ghar,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,A man has a thirst. The man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend.
3801,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,(Walks toward the cave). I have friends.
3802,rorge,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,Give us a beer. Before I skin you.
3803,jaqen h'ghar,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,"A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. (Pause). You're called Arry. (Arya nods).  This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar. Once of the Free City of Lorath."
3804,rorge,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,"Hey, you little shit. Get us beer!"
3805,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,You should have asked nicely.
3806,rorge,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,Come closer. And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.
3807,jaqen h'ghar,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,(Quietly) The boy has more courage than sense.
3808,rorge,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,Come here!
3809,gendry,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.
3810,rorge,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,Come here!
3811,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,They don't scare me.
3812,gendry,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me.
3813,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing?
3814,gendry,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,What are you doing?
3815,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,They're looking for me.
3816,gold cloak,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,You're in command here?
3817,yoren,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,You're a long way from home.
3818,gold cloak,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,I asked you a question.
3819,yoren,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,"Aye, you did. You asked without manners. And I chose not to answer."
3820,gold cloak,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,(Pulls out rolled up paper and hands it to Yoren). I have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
3821,yoren,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,"Well the thing is, (Hands back the paper), these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens."
3822,yoren,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,"It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it."
3823,yoren,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.
3824,gold cloak,2,12,the night lands,BLACKSMITH,We're looking for a boy named Gendry. (Gendry and Arya look shocked). He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back. With more men. (To Yoren) And I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.
3825,varys,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,My lord.
3826,shae,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,"You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company."
3827,varys,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
3828,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,It was quite a battle.
3829,varys,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
3830,shae,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,And I tell him the story of how we meet.
3831,varys,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.
3832,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,(Begins to pour wine). Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
3833,shae,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
3834,varys,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,How can you tell?
3835,shae,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,I can always tell.
3836,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. (Takes a sip).
3837,varys,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,"I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends."
3838,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,"Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned."
3839,varys,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,"How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. (Kisses Shae’s hand). Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord."
3840,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,I don't like threats.
3841,varys,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,Who threatened you?
3842,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
3843,varys,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,Ned Stark was a man of honor.
3844,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
3845,varys,2,12,the night lands,RED KEEP,"You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting."
3846,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"“From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” (Rips up the letter). He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that."
3847,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith."
3848,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?"
3849,alton lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"I will, Your Grace."
3850,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?
3851,alton lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace."
3852,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten."
3853,alton lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"I will, Your Grace."
3854,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Safe travels, cousin."
3855,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
3856,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,If that's everything?
3857,pycelle,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,(Holding a letter). A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.
3858,varys,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Trouble with the wildlings?
3859,petyr baelish,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,That's why they're called wildlings.
3860,varys,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
3861,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count."
3862,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
3863,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
3864,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them."
3865,pycelle,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,The northerners are a superstitious people.
3866,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. (The other stop leaving). Mormont doesn't lie."
3867,varys,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,How do you kill a dead man?
3868,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Apparently you burn him.
3869,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. (Walks away, followed by Varys)."
3870,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall."
3871,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
3872,eddison tollett,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"Then I said, if the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldn't make us fart when we died."
3873,grenn,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,We fart when we die?
3874,eddison tollett,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook."
3875,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?"
3876,eddison tollett,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,We were having a serious discussion.
3877,grenn,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,Would you look at that.
3878,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
3879,grenn,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,I prefer watching them come towards me.
3880,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,I'm sure that's nice too.
3881,grenn,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"Well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, (laughs), changed."
3882,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,You were with her? How many times?
3883,grenn,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"Well, as many times as I could."
3884,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
3885,eddison tollett,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,We need more potatoes. And get another sack for the sludge. (Sam begins to walk away). Get the turnips too.
3887,gilly,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,You shouldn't touch me.
3888,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. (Long pause)."
3889,gilly,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,You're very brave.
3890,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,What’re you doing?
3891,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters."
3892,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"Hello, Gilly. What’re you doing?"
3893,gilly,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,Sam said you could help.
3894,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -"
3895,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"She's pregnant. (Gilly encourages Sam to continue). We have to take her with us, when we leave."
3896,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,What? (Stands up).
3897,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,I know it sounds a bit mad.
3898,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible."
3899,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"The Lord Commander, (Jon tries and fails to interrupt Sam), we are sworn to protect -"
3900,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,Sam we can't take her -
3901,gilly,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"Please sir, please. I can still run if I have to."
3902,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,It's just not possible.
3903,gilly,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I…"
3904,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"If it's a boy what? (Gilly looks around and then down, not answering). You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why."
3905,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,Why did you do that?
3906,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"Do what, ask her a question?"
3907,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,You were cruel.
3908,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
3909,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,I didn't touch her!
3910,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
3911,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat."
3912,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?"
3913,sam,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"I could try. (Jon looks down, annoyed). What? I've read about it. A bit."
3914,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,CRASTER’S CAMP,"I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her."
3915,jorah mormont,2,12,the night lands,DESERT_2,Khaleesi.
3916,jorah mormont,2,12,the night lands,DESERT_2,You don't need to see this.
3917,daenerys targaryen,2,12,the night lands,DESERT_2,He is blood of my blood.
3918,daenerys targaryen,2,12,the night lands,DESERT_2,Who did this?
3919,jorah mormont,2,12,the night lands,DESERT_2,"Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar."
3920,daenerys targaryen,2,12,the night lands,DESERT_2,They will like it far less when I'm done with them.
3921,irri,2,12,the night lands,DESERT_2,"No! (Speaking Dothraki, to Daenerys) They killed his soul!"
3922,daenerys targaryen,2,12,the night lands,DESERT_2,(Speaking Dothraki) Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
3923,irri,2,12,the night lands,DESERT_2,(Speaking Dothraki) They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. (Daenerys kneels to Irri’s level). He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.
3924,daenerys targaryen,2,12,the night lands,DESERT_2,(Speaking Dothraki) Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.
3925,daenerys targaryen,2,12,the night lands,DESERT_2,"(Speaking Dothraki) And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight."
3927,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BOAT,(Removes his jacket). Looks smaller.
3929,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BOAT,(Removes more of his clothes). They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
3931,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BOAT,"Anyone who matters, (Takes off his shirt), this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet."
3933,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BOAT,"They say hard places breed hard men, (Unbuttons his pants), and hard men rule the world."
3935,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BOAT,"(Kneels down). Try smiling with your lips closed. (She does). Hmm, better."
3937,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BOAT,(Taking off his pants). I don't blame him.
3939,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BOAT,"Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture."
3941,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BOAT,Your place is on this ship.
3943,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BOAT,I haven't paid you.
3945,petyr baelish,2,12,the night lands,BROTHEL_2,"One moment, my friend. A moment."
3946,petyr baelish,2,12,the night lands,BROTHEL_2,Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.
3947,ros (prostitute),2,12,the night lands,BROTHEL_2,"I’m sorry, my lord."
3948,petyr baelish,2,12,the night lands,BROTHEL_2,Shhh. Did he hurt you?
3949,ros (prostitute),2,12,the night lands,BROTHEL_2,"No, my lord… It’s Mhaegen."
3950,petyr baelish,2,12,the night lands,BROTHEL_2,Who?
3951,ros (prostitute),2,12,the night lands,BROTHEL_2,"She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby."
3952,petyr baelish,2,12,the night lands,BROTHEL_2,"Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace."
3953,ros (prostitute),2,12,the night lands,BROTHEL_2,"Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby."
3954,petyr baelish,2,12,the night lands,BROTHEL_2,"You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. (Stands up). Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen’s child. I’ll see you tomorrow. But you’ll be happy? (Roz nods and smiles). That makes me happy."
3955,podrick payne,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,More wine?
3956,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"Damn it, boy!"
3957,podrick payne,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"Apologies, my lord."
3958,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine."
3959,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,(Podrick leaves). Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.
3960,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"Myself, I prefer the improper ones."
3961,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?"
3962,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"You know your wines, my lord."
3963,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"That I do. A fine dinner, my lord."
3964,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord."
3965,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
3966,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,Wars have been started for less.
3967,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
3968,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done."
3969,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies."
3970,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,Orders are orders.
3971,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
3972,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,I never said they were the queen's orders.
3973,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman."
3974,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,You know your sister better than I do.
3975,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
3976,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,I don't listen to filth.
3977,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children."
3978,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. (Sips his wine)."
3979,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.
3980,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
3981,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
3982,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.
3983,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."
3984,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf."
3985,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here."
3986,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."
3987,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -
3988,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
3989,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
3990,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"No, we shan't."
3991,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way."
3992,bronn,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord."
3993,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,These men are under my command. (Bronn laughs). I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
3994,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
3995,bronn,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,Boys?
3996,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!
3997,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,To the new Commander.
3998,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,"If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?"
3999,bronn,2,12,the night lands,DINING ROOM,Without question? No. I'd ask how much.
4000,lommy,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle."
4001,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,I'm not afraid of no battles.
4002,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants."
4003,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,I've seen lots of battles. I saw -
4004,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,Liar.
4005,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.
4006,lommy,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,Two men fighting isn't a battle.
4007,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,They had armor on.
4008,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,So?
4009,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"So, if they got armor on, it's a battle."
4010,lommy,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"No, it isn't."
4011,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?
4012,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"(Gendry walks over to get more water). Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle."
4013,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,(Hesitates) It's when they've got armor on.
4014,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,Now who told you that.
4015,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,A knight?
4016,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,How'd you know he was a knight?
4017,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"Well, cause he got armor on."
4018,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. (Arya smiles).
4019,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,How'd you know?
4020,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,‘Cause I sold armor.
4021,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,What do the gold cloaks want with you?
4022,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,(Turning around) No idea.
4023,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,You're a liar.
4024,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,(Walking to camp fire). You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.
4025,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. (Follows him).
4026,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"Well, I don’t care what any of them want. No good's ever come of their questions."
4027,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,No good's ever come? Who asked questions before?
4028,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
4029,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,Who asked questions?
4030,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died."
4031,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,Lord Stark.
4032,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,See? Asking me questions is bad luck. (Walks back to river). You'll probably be dead soon.
4033,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,What did they ask about?
4034,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,My mom.
4035,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,Who's your mom?
4036,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
4037,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,And who was your father?
4038,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?"
4039,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,I'm not a girl!
4040,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,(Walks back to camp fire). Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
4041,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that."
4042,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,That's true. You're still a girl.
4043,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,I am not!
4044,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then."
4045,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can’t know. No one can know.
4046,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,They won't. Not from me.
4047,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
4048,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
4049,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.
4050,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady."
4051,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -"
4052,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"You were a lord's daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady."
4053,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,Do not call me milady.
4054,gendry,2,12,the night lands,CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER,"As milady commands. (Arya pushes him). Well, that was unladylike."

4068,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_1,"You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years."
4069,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_1,Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?
4070,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_1,Don't you worry about my hands. (Theon begins fondling her). The sea's in my blood.
4071,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_1,Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
4072,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_1,"I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky."
4073,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_1,Is that an offer from my future king?
4074,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_1,"An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night."
4075,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_1,I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
4076,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,Father.
4077,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,"Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?"
4078,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,A man. Your blood and your heir.
4079,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.
4080,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,Lord Stark is gone.
4081,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,And how do you feel about that?
4082,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
4083,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,Who gave you those clothes? (Stands up).  Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?
4084,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,"If my clothes offend you, I will change them."
4085,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,It will. (Begins walking forward). That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? (Theon looks down). I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?
4086,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,Gold.
4087,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. (Balon walks towards the fireplace and looks into it). My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.
4088,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,(Steps forward). My blood is salt and iron.
4089,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,"Yet, (Turns around), the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message."
4090,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,"The offer he makes, is one I proposed."
4091,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,He heeds your counsel?
4092,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,"I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother."
4093,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,"No, not here, (Walks forward), not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?"
4094,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.
4095,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.
4096,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,I will lead the attack myself.
4097,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,"Oh, you will?"
4098,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
4099,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,I told you to wait outside. (The person who entered is revealed to be Yara). How did you get past the guards?
4100,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
4101,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,(Puts his arm around her). My dear.
4102,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,Yara?
4103,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,"So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about."
4104,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,She can't lead an attack!
4105,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,And why not?
4106,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,You're a woman!
4107,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,You're the one in skirts.
4108,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,"This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him."
4110,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,(Watching the letter burn in his hand). No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. (Throws the letter in the fire). That is who I am. That is who we have always been.
4111,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
4112,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,INSIDE PYKE,Who said anything about the Lannisters?
4113,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
4114,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?"
4115,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey."
4116,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"And yet, they both have larger armies."
4117,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.
4118,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.
4119,matthos,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"Mind your words, pirate. (They all stop walking)."
4120,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,Matthos.
4121,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.
4122,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them."
4123,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,That's a promise that always comes true.
4124,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong"
4125,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,Only the clever ones.
4126,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing."
4127,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
4128,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,It is. (Matthos rolls his eyes).
4129,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"One thing, I want the queen."
4130,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,The queen?
4131,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well."
4132,matthos,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
4133,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her."
4134,matthos,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,As if she would just let you!
4135,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.
4136,matthos,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god."
4137,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs."
4138,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
4139,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
4140,matthos,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,You believe your king can win?
4141,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,He is the one true king.
4142,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. (They laugh). I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich."
4143,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
4144,matthos,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,When will the King have a sail?
4145,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,As soon as his God wills it.
4146,matthos,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. (As they walk). Let me teach you how to read."
4147,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,Oh you and your mother.
4148,matthos,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
4149,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!"
4150,matthos,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,But you always came home.
4151,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,I wasn't praying.
4152,matthos,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"(They reach their horses). But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you."
4153,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis."
4154,matthos,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,"(As Davos is mounting his horse). Stannis is my king, but he's only a man."
4155,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,BEACH_2,Don't tell him that.
4156,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,TYRION’S ROOM_1,Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
4157,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,TYRION’S ROOM_1,I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
4158,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,TYRION’S ROOM_1,You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
4159,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,TYRION’S ROOM_1,"Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"
4160,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,TYRION’S ROOM_1,"Ha, the people. You think I care?"
4161,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,TYRION’S ROOM_1,"You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” (Cersei says nothing). You don't even have the decency to deny it."
4162,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,TYRION’S ROOM_1,"It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse."
4163,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,TYRION’S ROOM_1,"He did what needed to be done. (Now loudly). You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."
4164,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,TYRION’S ROOM_1,"I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
4165,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,TYRION’S ROOM_1,"I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. (Sits down). It's all fallen on me."
4166,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,TYRION’S ROOM_1,"(Tries not to laugh). As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
4167,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,TYRION’S ROOM_1,"You're funny. (Laughs). You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death."
4168,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,TYRION’S ROOM_1,She was my mother too.
4169,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,TYRION’S ROOM_1,"Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. (Storms out)."
4170,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,Your Grace.
4171,matthos,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,Your Grace.
4172,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,How did it fare with your pirate?
4173,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
4174,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,"In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men."
4175,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,Does seem the wiser choice.
4176,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
4177,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,"Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him."
4178,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,"Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us."
4179,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,"At once, Your Grace."
4180,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,"The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior."
4181,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,Come.
4182,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,What did you say to him?
4183,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,I told him death by fire is the purest death.
4184,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,Why?
4185,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
4186,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,Yeah.
4187,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
4188,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,Tell your lord to burn them then.
4189,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
4190,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
4191,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,You must have faith.
4192,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,"Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten."
4193,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,Then we must be the ten.
4194,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,"I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole."
4195,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,"I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."
4196,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,"I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols."
4197,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,You must give... all of yourself.
4198,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,I have a wife. I took a vow.
4199,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,"She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. (Whispers in his ear). I will give you a son, my King."
4200,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE KEEP,(Gasps). A son?

4212,jon snow,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1","No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys..."
4213,jon snow,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1",You know.
4214,jeor mormont,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1",Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.
4215,jon snow,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1",Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
4216,jeor mormont,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1","Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster."
4217,jon snow,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1",I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.

4224,sam,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, THE NEXT MORNING",Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.

4287,theon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",Why didn't you tell me?
4288,yara greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",I wanted to see who you were first. And I did.
4289,balon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",The plans are made. It's time you heard them.
4290,yara greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",Father.
4291,theon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",Father.
4292,balon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM","The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall."
4293,balon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM","Yara, my daughter, you'll take thirty longships to attack Deepwood Motte."
4294,yara greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",I've always wanted a castle.
4295,theon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",And what's my role in all this?
4296,balon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
4297,theon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?
4298,yara greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.

4301,theon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM","Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily."
4302,yara greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",They won't even know we're there until it's too late.
4303,theon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM","What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior."
4304,balon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM","Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect."
4305,theon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM","I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock."
4306,balon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",What are our words? Our words?
4307,theon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",We do not sow.
4308,balon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",We do not sow. We are Ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
4309,theon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM","You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?"
4310,theon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",You gave me away!
4311,theon greyjoy,2,13,what is dead may never die,"IRON ISLANDS, THRONE ROOM",Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.

4317,shae,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS",Why? You think your father can hear me? (yells) He's three hundred miles away!
4318,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS",I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
4319,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS","Again, only temporary."
4320,shae,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS",Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
4321,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS",But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.
4322,shae,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS",Scullion? What is a scullion?
4323,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS",(wincing) Kitchen wench.
4324,shae,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS",A kitchen wench?

4326,shae,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS",Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?
4327,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS",Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.
4328,shae,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS",I'm the weakness?
4329,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS","It's a compliment, my lady."
4330,shae,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS",How is being a weakness a compliment?
4331,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS",Language can be a bit tricky here.
4332,shae,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS","(with a mocking tone) Oh, I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. (sternly) I am not a kitchen wench."

4341,tommen baratheon,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, DINING HALL, NIGHT",No. I don't think so.

4349,shae,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT",Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
4350,sansa stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT",I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.
4351,shae,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT",What things?
4352,sansa stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT","(irritated) Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair."

4370,pycelle,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY","I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily."

4375,pycelle,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY","Why, yes, of course, my lord."
4376,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY",These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
4377,pycelle,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY","Matrimony, huh? Yes."
4378,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY","I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."

4380,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY","I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it."

4386,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY",Precisely.
4387,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY",Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
4388,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY","But remember, you must tell no one."

4390,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY",I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
4391,petyr baelish,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY",She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
4392,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY","For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
4393,petyr baelish,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY",And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
4394,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY",Who better?
4395,petyr baelish,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY","Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"
4396,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY","The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal."

4412,renly baratheon,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT",I'll make it up to you.
4413,loras tyrell,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT","No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone."
4414,loras tyrell,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT",Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.

4439,cersei lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT",Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
4440,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT",That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.

Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours."

4457,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT","No, afraid not. Sorry about that."
4458,petyr baelish,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT","And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well."

4461,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT","Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in."
4462,petyr baelish,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT",Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
4463,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT","No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"

4472,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL",So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
4473,pycelle,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL","No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider."
4474,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL","See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you."

4487,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL",So you poisoned him?
4488,pycelle,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL",(offended) No. Never.
4489,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL","But you let him die, made sure he succumbed."

4495,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1",Good. One of my better ideas.
4496,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1",And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
4497,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1","Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day."
4498,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1",The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
4499,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1","Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?"
4500,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1","Why, am I about to hear one?"
4501,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1","Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?"
4502,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1",Depends on the sellsword.
4503,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1",Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
4504,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1","He has a sword, the power of life and death."
4505,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1","But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?"
4506,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1",I've decided I don't like riddles.
4507,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1","Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."

4514,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,"Same as most men, I think."
4515,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,"But you've seen things, horrible things."
4516,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,"Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many."
4517,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,How do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?
4518,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,You didn't see that. I made damn sure.
4519,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,"I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and... and my sister."
4520,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,"You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lad's name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?"
4521,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,"Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves."

4525,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,"No, I'm not afraid."
4526,gendry,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,I can fight.
4527,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,"(pointing at both of them) Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back."
4528,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,"(yelling) Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!"
4533,amory lorch,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,"Where's the bastard, crow?"
4534,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,Got more than a few bastards here. Who's asking?
4535,amory lorch,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,"Ser Amory Lorch, sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister. These men from the capital requested our assistance. Drop your weapons in the name of the King."

4537,amory lorch,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,"This is your last chance. In the name of King Joffrey, drop your weapons."
4538,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,I don't think I will.
4539,amory lorch,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,So be it.

4556,lommy,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,Look at it.
4557,polliver,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,Can you walk?
4558,lommy,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,No. You got to carry me.
4559,polliver,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,All right.
4560,polliver,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,"""Carry him,"" he says."
4561,amory lorch,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS,We're looking for a bastard named Gendry. Give him up or I'll start taking eyeballs.

4637,talisa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD,He was unlucky that you were.
4638,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.
4639,sansa stark,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,"Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please"

4641,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,"Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain."
4642,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,Killing you would send your brother a message.
4643,sansa stark,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,(cries)
4644,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn.
4645,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,Leave her face. I like her pretty.
4646,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,"Meryn, my lady is overdressed. Unburden her."
4647,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,"If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder."
4648,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,What is the meaning of this?
4649,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
4650,meryn trant,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,"The kind who serves his king, Imp."
4651,bronn,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,"Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak."
4652,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
4653,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,I'm punishing her.
4654,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,"For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit."
4655,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!
4656,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
4657,meryn trant,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
4658,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,"I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?"
4659,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
4660,sansa stark,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,"I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love."
4661,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,"Lady Stark, you may survive us yet."
4662,bronn,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.
4663,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
4664,bronn,2,14,garden of bones,THRONE ROOM_2,There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.

4680,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS,I said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth.

4691,renly baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP",Just not a loyal one.
4692,petyr baelish,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP",And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?
4693,renly baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP","I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?"
4694,renly baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP",You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.
4695,petyr baelish,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP","You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim."
4696,renly baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP","Now I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head."
4697,petyr baelish,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP",I would give priority to my head.

4703,margaery tyrell,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT","It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again."
4704,petyr baelish,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT","""Your tent""? Not ""Our tent""? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne."
4705,margaery tyrell,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT","I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers."
4706,petyr baelish,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT","If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now."

4710,petyr baelish,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT","Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else."

4713,margaery tyrell,2,14,garden of bones,"RENLY'S CAMP, NIGHT","That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night."

4809,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,STORMLANDS,"It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me."
4810,catelyn stark,2,14,garden of bones,STORMLANDS,We share a common enemy.
4811,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,STORMLANDS,The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.
4812,renly baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,STORMLANDS,"The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power."
4813,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,STORMLANDS,"For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you."

4816,renly baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,STORMLANDS,No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.

4851,xaro xhoan daxos,2,14,garden of bones,THE GATES OF QARTH,Very well. I invoke soumai.
4852,xaro xhoan daxos,2,14,garden of bones,THE GATES OF QARTH,"I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law."

4857,gendry,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, TORTURE AREA_1",I'm not from the village.
4858,the tickler,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, TORTURE AREA_1",Where is the Brotherhood?
4859,gendry,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, TORTURE AREA_1",I don't know what that is.

4862,gregor clegane,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD","We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin."
4863,tywin lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD",Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
4864,gregor clegane,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD","Cells are overflowing, my lord."
4865,polliver,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD","This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just-"
4866,tywin lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD",Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?
4867,tywin lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD","You, do you have a trade?"
4868,gendry,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD","Smith, my lord."

4870,tywin lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD","He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?"

4875,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle. Here's your warrant."
4876,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
4877,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp."
4878,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?"
4879,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately."
4880,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
4881,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,As I said several times.
4882,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
4883,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay."
4884,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf."
4885,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn.
4886,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
4887,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl."
4888,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,I am a knight!
4889,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?"
4890,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
4891,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
4892,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,It's not my fault!
4893,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?"
4894,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything."
4895,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"Did he tell you to fuck her, too?"
4896,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,I only meant I did as I was bid.
4897,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this."
4898,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you."
4899,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
4900,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear."
4901,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"No, I think not."
4902,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,My lord?
4903,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me."
4904,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command."
4905,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent."
4906,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,But her demands?
4907,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"Oh, I'll give her Pycelle."
4908,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,You will?
4909,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,HALLWAY OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS.,"Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length."

4912,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT","Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean."
4913,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT",Fewer.
4914,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT",Pardon?
4915,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT",Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
4916,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT",It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
4917,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT","You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good."
4918,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT",A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
4919,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT",Does he listen?
4920,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT","To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest"
4921,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT",She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
4922,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT",I've lived within the law for seventeen-
4923,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT",I want you to be a smuggler this time.
4924,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT","Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?"
4925,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT",The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
4926,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT","I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways."
4927,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"THE STORMLANDS SEA, NIGHT",Cleaner ways don't win wars.
4928,melisandre,2,14,garden of bones,"STORMLANDS, SHORELINE","Are you afraid, Onion Knight?"

4948,renly baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,You swear it?
4949,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
4950,renly baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,"Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty."
4951,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,And the wording of this oath?
4952,renly baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,"The same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together."
4953,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,And in return for my son's loyalty?
4954,renly baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,"In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army."
4955,renly baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,"When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before."
4956,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,"Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother."
4957,renly baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.
4958,renly baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.

4963,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.
4966,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,I won't leave him.
4967,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,You can't avenge him if you're dead.
4969,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT,Not that way.

4973,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,"Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king."
4974,loras tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,And you want that privilege for yourself.
4975,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,"You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis."
4976,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,There's no time for this.
4977,loras tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,"Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis."
4978,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
4979,loras tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?
4980,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,Stannis.
4981,loras tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,I will put a sword through his righteous face.
4982,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,You can't stay here.
4983,loras tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,"He would have been a true king, a good king."
4984,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,"Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?"
4985,loras tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,Revenge.
4986,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,"I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."
4987,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.
4988,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,He was very handsome.
4989,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,"He was, Your Grace."
4990,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,"""Your Grace."" Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen."
4991,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,Do you want to be a queen?
4992,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,RENLY'S TENT_1,No. I want to be the queen.
4993,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,Killed? By whom?
4994,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
4995,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,Really? Who'd have thought?
4996,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,"Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
4997,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,"Whomever did it, I say well done."
4998,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,"It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."
4999,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
5000,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,"And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
5001,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,"Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?"
5002,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,She'll be safer in Dorne.
5003,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,"Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."
5004,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,"It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
5005,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
5006,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
5007,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
5008,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
5009,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,"You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
5010,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,It's important that we talk about this.
5011,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,TYRION'S CHAMBERS,It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
5012,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,It's wildfire.
5013,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,"Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
5014,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,No.
5015,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,MThat's a lie right there.
5016,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
5017,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,"Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
5018,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,I'm telling you the truth.
5019,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,The smart money would be on more likely.
5020,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,She's making wildfire.
5021,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
5022,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
5023,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,I suppose there's only one way to find out.
5024,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.
5025,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,When did she tell you this?
5026,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,"I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you."
5027,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,Swear to me on what?
5028,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,On my life.
5029,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,But I don't care about your life.
5030,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,"In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow..."
5031,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,"All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out."
5032,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,"Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me."
5033,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.
5034,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING,It will be my pleasure.
5035,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",Your Grace.
5036,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",What is it?
5037,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2","I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him."
5038,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2","Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
5039,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
5040,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
5041,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2","Your Grace, I-"
5042,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
5043,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",And I've never known you to hide from the truth.
5044,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",You've come to lecture me on truth?
5045,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",I've come to tell you that what I saw.
5046,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2","All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne."
5047,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2","Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron"
5048,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",I'll hear no more about it.
5050,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",When do we sail for King's Landing?
5051,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2","As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."
5052,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
5053,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",That's not your concern.
5054,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2","If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers."
5055,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
5056,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",Loyal service means telling hard truths.
5057,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2","Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?"
5058,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
5059,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",What do you believe?
5060,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
5061,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2",We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
5062,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2","Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy."
5063,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_2","Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."
5067,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET","Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?"
5068,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET",There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
5069,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET","Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
5070,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET",Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
5071,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET","He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."
5075,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET",It's hard to argue with his assessment.
5076,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET",Not after what he did to your birthday present.
5077,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET",The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
5079,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET",You have to admire his imagination.
5080,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET",He's talking about you.
5081,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET",What? Demon monkey?
5082,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET",People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.
5083,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET",Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
5084,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET",You don't need to convince me.
5085,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, STREET MARKET",Demon monkey.
5087,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.
5088,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!
5089,black lorren,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING","Where are we headed, Captain?"
5090,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING","The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well."
5091,black lorren,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",And who decides if we've done our jobs well?
5092,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",I do. Your captain.
5093,black lorren,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING","I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?"
5094,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING","You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."
5095,black lorren,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",(laughs)
5096,yara greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",Stop. We yield.
5097,yara greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",Congratulations on your first command.
5098,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
5099,yara greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING","Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got thirty ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow."
5100,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
5101,yara greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING","That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore."
5102,dagmer,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING","Come on, I'll take you out."
5103,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",Who are you?
5104,dagmer,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING","Dagmer, your first mate."
5105,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
5106,dagmer,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
5107,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
5108,dagmer,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",You're not.
5109,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
5110,dagmer,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?
5111,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
5112,dagmer,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING","The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?"
5113,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING","No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-"
5114,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING",Take me to my ship.
5115,reginald lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,"The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed."
5116,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.
5117,amory lorch,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
5118,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,"And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?"
5119,reginald lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,"We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep."
5120,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,"Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you."
5121,reginald lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,My wife's in Lannisport.
5122,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,"Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head."
5123,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,"If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!"
5124,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,"Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?"
5125,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,"Maidenpool, my lord."
5126,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
5127,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,"House Mooton, my lord."
5128,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,And what is their sigil?
5129,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,"A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?"
5130,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,(nods)
5131,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,"Good. One more time, where are you from?"
5132,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,"Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown."
5133,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
5134,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,They call him the Young Wolf.
5135,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,And?
5136,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.
5137,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,And do you believe them?
5138,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,"No, my lord. Anyone can be killed."
5139,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL,Fetch that water.
5140,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,A girl says nothing.
5141,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,(gasps)
5142,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,"A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl."
5143,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,I was always a girl.
5144,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.
5145,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.
5146,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
5147,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,I didn't have a choice.
5148,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,You did. I did. And here we are.
5149,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,A man pays his debts. A man owes three.
5150,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,Three what?
5151,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,"The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done."
5152,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,I can name anyone and you'll kill him?
5153,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,A man has said.
5154,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,The one who tortures everyone.
5155,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,A man needs a name.
5156,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.
5157,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_1,"That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty."
5158,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH,"He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn."
5159,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH,When will he come?
5160,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH,The Halfhand does things in his own time.
5161,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH,My uncle told me stories about him.
5162,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH,Most of them are true.
5163,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH,I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
5164,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH,The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.
5165,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH,So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
5166,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH,"Well, possible for the Halfhand."
5167,sam,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH,"Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here."
5168,dolorous edd,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH,(to GRENN) There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.
5170,sam,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,A SNOWY CLIFFSIDE,"The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men."
5171,dolorous edd,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,A SNOWY CLIFFSIDE,"Before I die, please, stop talking."
5172,sam,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,A SNOWY CLIFFSIDE,"Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?"
5173,dolorous edd,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,A SNOWY CLIFFSIDE,Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
5174,grenn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,A SNOWY CLIFFSIDE,(laughs)
5175,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,A SNOWY CLIFFSIDE,I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
5176,grenn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,A SNOWY CLIFFSIDE,Wildlings?
5177,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,A SNOWY CLIFFSIDE,One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
5178,dolorous edd,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,A SNOWY CLIFFSIDE,"So you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes."
5179,sam,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,A SNOWY CLIFFSIDE,"And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times."
5180,grenn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,A SNOWY CLIFFSIDE,"But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?"
5181,sam,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,A SNOWY CLIFFSIDE,Well I read it in a book.
5182,dolorous edd,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,A SNOWY CLIFFSIDE,I read it in a book.
5183,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,A SNOWY CLIFFSIDE,Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.
5184,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR","Take care, my lord."
5185,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR","I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, ""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. """
5186,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR","Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow."
5187,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR","After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power."

5189,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR",My companion takes issue.
5190,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR",If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
5191,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR",Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
5192,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR",To do what?
5193,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR",The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
5194,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR",How much do you have?
5195,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR","If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father."
5196,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR","My lord, this man is insulting."
5197,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR","I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down."
5198,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR",My friend remains unconvinced.
5199,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR",He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
5200,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR","Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks."
5201,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR","We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both."
5202,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR",This is a shit idea.
5203,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR","I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me."
5204,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,Dracarys. Dracarys.
5205,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,He'll be able to feed himself from now on.
5206,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,"Let him sleep, Doreah."
5207,doreah,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,"Yes, Khaleesi."
5208,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,(amused) He loves you.
5209,irri,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,(Dothraki) I rewove this part of the top. And I fixed the heel on this one.
5210,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,"Thank you, my friend."
5211,doreah,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.
5212,irri,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,It is known.
5213,doreah,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos-
5214,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,"The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo."
5215,irri,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,(Dothraki) May he ride forever through the night lands.
5216,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,"Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy."
5217,doreah,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,(chuckles) You would look like a real princess in Xaro's-
5218,irri,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,"She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi. You should wear it, Khaleesi."
5219,irri,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH,You are their guest. It would be rude not to.
5221,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",It sounds wonderful.
5223,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",Please excuse me for a moment.
5224,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",(speaks Dothraki)
5225,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",What are they doing?
5226,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY","Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry."
5227,kovarro,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",(Dothraki) Or melt it. Very simple.
5228,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",(Dothraki)  We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
5229,kovarro,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY","(Dothraki) Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave."
5230,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",(Dothraki) Not even when we leave.
5231,kovarro,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",(Dothraki) Why not?
5232,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",(Dothraki) Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
5233,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
5234,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.
5235,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
5236,pyat pree,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY","Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration?"
5237,pyat pree,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once.
5238,pyat pree,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY","Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons."
5239,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",My apologies. Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
5240,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",What is the House of the Undying?
5241,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY","It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic."
5242,quaithe,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",You watch over her.
5243,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",Do I know you?
5244,quaithe,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
5245,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY",Who are you?
5246,quaithe,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN PARTY","I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power."
5247,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",It looked like Stannis.
5248,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.
5249,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",In the shape of Stannis.
5250,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
5251,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS","Will you stay there long, my lady?"
5252,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS","Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long."
5253,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",I never knew my mother.
5254,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",I'm sorry.
5255,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.
5256,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",It's a bloody business.
5257,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",What comes after is even harder.
5258,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS","Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?"
5259,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",You mean to kill Stannis.
5260,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",I swore a vow.
5261,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
5262,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.
5263,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.
5264,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",I only held him that once as he was dying.
5265,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS","He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well."
5266,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS","I do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis."
5267,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS","When the time comes, I will not hold you back."
5268,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS","Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new."
5269,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS",I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
5270,winterfell shepherd,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL","And it's not just thieves, my lord. There's wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen. They come down in the night and they kill my sheep. My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord. They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home. I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night."
5271,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL",We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.
5272,winterfell shepherd,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL","My wife always prayed for more children. We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord. And may the gods bless you and yours."
5273,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL","(to RICKON) Stop it. If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark."
5274,luwin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL",Good.
5275,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL",Hodor.
5276,hodor,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL",Hodor.
5277,rodrik cassel,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL",Bran! Lord Stark. Torrhen's Square is under siege.
5278,luwin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL",Torrhen's Square is barely forty leagues from here. How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
5279,rodrik cassel,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL",Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain. Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.
5280,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL",We have to help them.
5281,rodrik cassel,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL","Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather two hundred decent men."
5282,luwin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL",Do you need so many?
5283,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL","If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need."
5284,rodrik cassel,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"WINTERFELL, GREAT HALL","Won't take long, my lord. Southerners don't do well up here."
5285,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,"So, what does it mean?"
5286,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,Ask your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time.
5287,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.
5288,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,"Must not mean anything, then."
5289,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,You're lying.
5290,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,"You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar."
5291,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,You know what it means.
5292,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,I never said I didn't.
5293,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,You didn't give me an honest answer.
5294,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,That's not the same as being a liar.
5295,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,"Well, it's not far off."
5296,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,"So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream. Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream?"
5297,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,"Something bad? Tell me, boy."
5298,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,"I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell. I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls. It flooded the castle. Drowned men were floating here, in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them."
5299,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,The sea is hundreds of miles away.
5300,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,I know. It's just a stupid dream.
5301,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen. Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.
5302,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,"Osha. The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?"
5303,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_1,They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.
5304,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,There.
5305,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,Where?
5306,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,On that mountain.
5307,sam,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,I don't see very well.
5308,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,A fire.
5309,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,"There's a fire. The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine. When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal. Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor."
5310,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,How many wildlings have joined him?
5311,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,"From what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move."
5312,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,Where?
5313,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,Somewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.
5314,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,You saying we should fall back to the Wall?
5315,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,"Mance was one of us once. Now he's one of them. He's going to teach them our way of doing things. They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back. They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us. So we need to be more like them, do things their way. Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. And to do that"
5316,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,We need to get rid of those lookouts.
5317,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,"It's not a job for 400 men. I need to move fast and silent. Harker, Stonesnake, Borba."
5318,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,"Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin."
5319,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,"I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin. You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger."
5320,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?
5321,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,He's the one?
5322,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
5323,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,"Craster? In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat."
5324,sam,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,"I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble."
5325,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL,"Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward. Go on."
5326,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN","So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?"
5327,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN",He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend.
5328,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN",Unlikely. I can almost always tell what a man wants.
5329,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN",And what about what a woman wants?
5330,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN","Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?"
5331,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN",To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
5332,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN",Why?
5333,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN",Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.
5334,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN",You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
5335,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN",I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
5336,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN","Ah, a conqueror."
5337,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN",And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
5338,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN","No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo."
5339,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN","So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious."
5340,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN",(chuckles)
5341,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN","What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why?"
5342,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, GARDEN",I will show you why.
5343,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,XARO'S VAULT.,The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark. I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key.
5344,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,XARO'S VAULT.,And behind the door?
5345,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,XARO'S VAULT.,(chuckles)
5346,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,XARO'S VAULT.,And it can all be mine?
5347,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,XARO'S VAULT.,"All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies. Enough to go home."
5348,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,XARO'S VAULT.,All I have to do?
5349,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,XARO'S VAULT.,Is marry me.
5350,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,XARO'S VAULT.,That was a romantic proposal.
5351,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,XARO'S VAULT.,"I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses."
5352,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,XARO'S VAULT.,"See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead."
5353,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS",If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it...
5354,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS",The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country.
5355,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS","To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros."
5356,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS",The usurper is dead.
5357,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS",(laughs)
5358,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS","The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other."
5359,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS",According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
5360,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS",The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.

5362,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS","And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now."

5365,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS",I only want-
5366,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS",What do you want? Tell me.
5367,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS",To see you on the Iron Throne.
5368,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS",Why?
5369,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS","You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real."
5370,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS","So what would you have me do, as my advisor?"

5373,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS",I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain.
5374,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"QARTH, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS",I look forward to meeting him.

5378,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_2,Sideways.
5379,gendry,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_2,Why?
5380,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_2,Smaller target.
5381,gendry,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_2,Am I fighting someone?
5382,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,HARRENHAL_2,You're practicing for a fight. You should practice right.

5387,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,I've taken your castle.
5388,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,Theon?
5389,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.
5390,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,Why?
5391,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,To take the castle.
5392,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,You went with Robb.
5393,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?
5394,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,I don't know.
5395,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,Find the halfwit.
5396,dagmer,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,(nods)
5397,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.
5398,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,Why?
5399,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
5400,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,I won't.
5401,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,"Yes, you will."
5402,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,I won't. I'll never yield. We'll fight you and throw you out.
5403,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,"The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say."
5404,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS,Theon. Did you hate us the whole time?
5405,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.
5406,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,Louder. Say Prince Theon.
5407,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me.
5408,farlen,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit."
5409,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"Farlen, you be silent."
5410,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do."
5411,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,All of you should do as he commands.
5412,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.
5413,farlen,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with it-
5414,ironborn,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,Shut up!
5415,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?"
5416,luwin,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,I am.
5417,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens.
5418,luwin,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,My lord.
5419,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,My Lord Greyjoy.
5420,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.
5421,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,You were here the day I was taken.
5422,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,I'm the one who took you. What of it?
5423,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,Let me serve you.
5424,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts."
5425,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again.
5426,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.
5427,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,Step aside.
5428,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,Why?
5429,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"It's your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain't letting it drown me."
5430,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,You'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time-
5431,black lorren,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,Greyjoy!
5432,black lorren,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword.
5433,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes."
5434,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people.
5435,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,They are not my people.
5436,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,King Robb thought of you as a brother.
5437,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you."
5438,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons."
5439,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home."
5440,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,If he were alive to see this
5441,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.
5442,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.
5443,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"You've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll-"
5444,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,Take him to the cells. Lock him up
5445,dagmer,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,My prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay.
5446,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.
5447,dagmer,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"No, he has to pay the iron price. They'll never respect you while he lives."
5448,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death!"
5449,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.
5450,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.
5451,luwin,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,I urge you not to make a hasty decision.
5452,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine."
5453,luwin,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do."
5454,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.
5455,dagmer,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,Come.
5456,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,No! No! Theon! Please. Ser Rodrik!
5457,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
5458,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,I'm begging you.
5459,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,Coward.
5460,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,Stop. Stop! Stop right now!
5461,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"You don't give commands anymore, little lord."
5462,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"Please, stop this. Please stop him."
5463,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"Hush now, child. I'm off to see your father."
5464,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please."
5465,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"Any last words, old man?"
5466,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost."
5467,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"Theon, please don't."
5468,rickon stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,Do something!
5469,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_2,"I'll do anything, please! No, please stop it!"
5470,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!"
5471,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,There goes your pet.
5472,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,He's not a pet.
5473,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"No, you're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing."
5474,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Ghost is different.
5475,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night."
5476,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
5477,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.
5478,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,We could do the same.
5479,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it."
5480,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,My father always said I'm of the North.
5481,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,(laughs)
5482,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,I wasn't joking.
5483,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?"
5484,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,(nods)
5485,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life."
5486,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,I'll gladly give my life.
5487,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?"
5488,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,I do.
5489,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us."
5490,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,Can you read?
5491,amory lorch,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,My lord?
5492,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,Can you read?
5493,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
5494,amory lorch,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"My apologies, my lord. I must have-"
5495,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this-"
5496,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,My cupbearer can read better than you.
5497,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
5499,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have twenty thousand men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us."
5500,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it."
5502,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,Mmm. Give us the room.
5503,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,(to Arya) Clear all this.
5504,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,Lord Tywin.
5505,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,(not amused) Baelish.
5506,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,Wine?
5507,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,Thank you.
5508,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,What news from the capital?
5509,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
5510,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear."
5511,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.
5512,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
5513,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
5514,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?"
5515,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers."
5516,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"Yes, yes, yes."
5517,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery-
5518,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,Wants to be queen.
5519,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"Yes, she does."
5520,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.
5521,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated."
5522,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,(to Arya) More wine for Lord Baelish.
5523,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement TYWIN"
5524,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,They have.
5525,arya stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"Pardon, my lord."
5526,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,It's only wine.
5527,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,You would ride there yourself?
5528,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"Tonight, with your leave."
5529,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl."
5530,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,And what else?
5531,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,"On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark."
5532,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,Why?
5533,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
5534,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_3,Hmm.
5535,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL.,A girl.

5762,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,No fire.
5763,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,Have it your way.
5764,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,We'll stay warmer if we stay close.
5765,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life.
5766,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,Think they're out looking for you?
5767,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,Yes.
5768,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,Think they'll find you?
5769,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,Yes.
5770,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,"You're brave. Stupid, but brave."
5771,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,We start again at first light. Get some sleep.
5772,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,Stop moving.
5773,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,I'm just trying to get comfortable.
5774,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,Stop it!
5775,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,You're still moving.
5776,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,Was I? I didn't notice that time.
5777,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_2,(sighs)
5778,robb stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,This cannot be true.
5779,roose bolton,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,"We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I'm afraid it is true."
5780,robb stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,Why? Why would Theon-
5781,roose bolton,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.
5782,robb stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,My brothers?
5783,roose bolton,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,We've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
5784,catelyn stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,"I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!"
5785,robb stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,I must go north at once.
5786,roose bolton,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,"There's still a war to win, Your Grace."
5787,robb stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't-
5788,roose bolton,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,You are a king. And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.
5789,catelyn stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,Let me go and talk to Theon.
5790,robb stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,There will be no talk. He will die for this.
5791,roose bolton,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,"Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head."
5792,robb stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER,"Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself."
5793,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
5794,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,I'm no liar.
5795,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.
5796,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,"I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord."
5797,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.
5798,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,"There are other ways to serve, my lord."
5799,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,"I'm a prince now, and you'd do well-"
5800,asha greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,"There are other ways to serve, my prince."
5801,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,Like what?
5802,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,"We know things, the free people."
5803,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?
5804,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,Other things.
5805,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,Savage things.
5806,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,Wait outside.
5807,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,I always wondered what you had under there.
5808,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,It comes at a price.
5809,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,I'm not killing you. That's your price.
5810,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,I already had that.
5811,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,"What do you want then, other than your miserable life?"
5812,asha greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,What all free people want. My freedom.
5813,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_3,"Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well."

5816,sansa stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS",I thought they were going to kill me.
5817,shae,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS","They thought so, too."

5819,shae,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS",Of course he did.
5820,sansa stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS",Why? Why would a stranger-
5821,shae,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS",You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead.
5822,sansa stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS",I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them.
5823,shae,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS",Don't say these things. If the wrong people hear you-
5824,sansa stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS",But you're not the wrong people.
5825,shae,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS",Don't trust anybody. Life is safer that way.

5829,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,"WINTERFELL, NIGHT",Me. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm.
5830,daenerys targaryen,2,16,the old gods and the new,"QARTH, GARDEN PATH",The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
5831,xaro xhoan daxos,2,16,the old gods and the new,"QARTH, GARDEN PATH","When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets."

5836,theon greyjoy,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_5,"The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?"

5838,theon greyjoy,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_5,Right. Get the horses and the hounds.

5843,luwin,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL,"So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord."

5849,luwin,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL,Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
5850,theon greyjoy,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL,"Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000."

5854,bran stark,2,17,a man without honor,WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL_1,We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.

5872,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,Let's move.
5873,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"It is the first time. How old are you, boy?"
5874,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
5875,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets-

5877,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"What, stones? Or bone?"
5878,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,Neither. Both.
5879,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,Move!
5880,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?"
5881,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"There are no women of the Night's Watch, no."
5882,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,So the lads just do it with each other?
5883,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,No.
5884,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,Never?
5885,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,Never. We swore an oath.
5886,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable."
5887,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,Would you please shut up?
5888,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman."
5889,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,You're a free woman?
5890,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman."
5891,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what ""prisoner"" means."
5892,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
5893,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,It was my choice to say the words.
5894,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,So you don't like girls?
5895,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,Of course I like girls.
5896,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,But you chose never to touch them.
5897,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
5898,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands-"
5899,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!"
5900,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
5901,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours."
5902,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,So why are you fighting us?
5904,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.
5905,gregor clegane,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,We hanged twenty men last night.
5906,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,I don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
5907,gregor clegane,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
5908,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,"Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one."
5909,gregor clegane,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,"Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence."
5911,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Mmm. Is that mutton?
5912,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,"Yes, my lord."
5913,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Don't like mutton.
5914,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,I'll bring something else.
5915,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Leave it. Are you hungry?
5916,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,No.
5917,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Of course you are. Eat.
5918,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,I'll eat in the kitchen later.
5919,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer. Sit. Eat.
5920,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
5921,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,I eat a lot. I just don't grow.
5922,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.
5923,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Have you ever lost before?
5924,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
5925,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,(shakes her head)
5926,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,"But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months."
5927,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.
5928,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,"The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?"
5929,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Dragons?
5930,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Yes. Dragons happened.
5931,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,"Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name"
5932,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Aegon and his sisters.
5933,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Mmm?
5934,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,"It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too."
5935,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,"Correct. A student of history, are you?"
5936,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
5937,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
5938,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
5939,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,"Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?"
5940,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,(smiles)
5941,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
5942,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,Most girls are idiots.
5943,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
5944,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_1,From my father.

5977,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH,"We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night."

6124,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT","I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about."
6125,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",I understand completely.
6126,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT","How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you."
6127,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT","It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice."
6128,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",Which knight was it?
6129,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
6130,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",What was he like?
6131,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT","He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
6132,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",It's hard to put into words.
6133,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT","It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life."
6134,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",(nods) Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
6135,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",Did you squire for him again?
6136,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT","No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire."
6137,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",(smiles)
6138,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT","It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint."
6139,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",And have you thought about
6140,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",Of course. Every day.
6141,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",And?
6142,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT","Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful."
6143,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",(nods)
6144,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT","But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now."
6145,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",What is it?
6146,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",It's actually quite simple.
6147,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT","Well, let me help you."
6148,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",You'll only have to do one thing.
6149,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT",Tell me.

6217,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,How many times can you read one raven scroll?
6218,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships."
6219,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,More than we have.
6220,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind."
6221,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above."
6222,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"""Rain fire on them from above."" You're quoting Father, aren't you?"
6223,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?"
6224,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
6225,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
6226,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
6227,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
6228,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,I thought the girls might help him.
6229,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,Did you?
6230,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,I was wrong. If we can't control him
6231,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.
6232,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
6233,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.
6234,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,The boy is more Robert than Jaime.
6235,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins."
6236,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,Sins?
6237,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""
6238,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them."

6248,brienne of tarth,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,"The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?"
6249,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,Come.
6250,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,I need to be alone with him.
6252,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,"Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him."
6253,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,"Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?"
6254,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,Do you hear them out there? They want your head.
6255,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
6256,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,You strangled his son with your chains.
6257,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.
6258,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
6259,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,"So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?"
6260,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,"She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer."
6261,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,"Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back."
6262,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,You are a man without honor.
6263,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,"Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?"
6264,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,Brienne.
6265,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,"No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman."
6266,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT,(to BRIENNE) Your sword.
6267,theon greyjoy,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_6,I told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not.

6269,theon greyjoy,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_6,"If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question."

6273,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,"Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell."
6274,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,Envy isn't attractive.
6275,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,What envy?
6276,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with twenty men.
6277,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,"You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?"
6278,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,"I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery."
6279,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,You treated them with honor? By butchering them?
6280,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,Before I had to kill them- I treated them-
6281,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,"You seized their home, as is your right. We're Ironborn, we take what we need."
6282,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,Exactly.
6283,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.
6284,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,They made me a promise
6285,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
6286,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,Don't call me
6287,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?
6288,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,"If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak."
6289,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,You are weak. And you're stupid.
6290,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,I'm warning you.
6291,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,"Go on, then. Warn me."
6292,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
6293,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,You're not. I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word.
6294,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.
6295,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,"Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out-"
6296,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.
6297,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,(to her men) Leave us.
6298,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,"Theon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother. We both endured our father. Come home with me. Don't die here alone."
6299,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,I don't intend to die.
6300,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL,"You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea."
6301,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_4,"I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones."
6303,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_4,Mance will want to question this one. Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.
6305,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_4,He could have killed me half a dozen times.
6307,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_4,"He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son."
6308,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_4,Mance will want him.
6310,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_4,I don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself.
6312,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_4,"He runs, I'll do it meself."
6313,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_4,"We're even now, Jon Snow."
6314,jon snow,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_4,"I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-"
6315,qhorin,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_4,I know.
6316,jon snow,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_4,The others?
6317,qhorin,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_4,"When you didn't come back, we went looking for you. We found your tracks fast enough. But they found us before we found you."
6318,jon snow,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_4,They died because of me.
6319,qhorin,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_4,See that it wasn't for nothing.
6322,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,Is she beautiful?
6323,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,I've never met her.
6324,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,What's her name?
6325,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,"Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name."
6326,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,I'm sure you'll be very happy.
6327,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,And you're marrying her for a bridge?
6328,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,An important bridge.
6329,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,Ah.
6330,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,"It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge."
6331,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,"When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father."
6332,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,"He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but"
6333,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,"Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me."
6334,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,"He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me."
6335,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,I wish I could have met him.
6336,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,He would have liked you.
6337,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,(chuckles) Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
6338,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,He didn't care much about gold or glory.
6339,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. I want the men following me to go home.
6340,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,Then why don't you?
6341,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.
6342,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,"Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean."
6343,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,That would be a start.
6345,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS,How? How?
6346,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,Tell me this isn't true.
6347,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,Why?
6348,catelyn stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,For the girls.
6349,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,You betrayed me.
6350,catelyn stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,Robb-
6351,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
6352,catelyn stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,"Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free."
6353,rickard karstark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,"I lost one son fighting by your son's side. I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain. You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell."
6354,catelyn stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,"I grieve for your sons, my lord."
6355,rickard karstark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance. And you stole it from me.
6356,catelyn stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,"Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine."
6357,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.
6358,catelyn stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
6360,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,Send another forty with our fastest horses.
6361,catelyn stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT,Robb.
6362,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,Damn.
6363,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,"You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin."
6364,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.
6365,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,Brienne of Tarth.
6366,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,"Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another."
6367,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.
6368,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,"I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me."
6369,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,"Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer."
6370,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
6371,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,"You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent."
6372,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
6373,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,You will not provoke me to anger.
6374,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
6375,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,I've never seen you fight.
6376,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.
6377,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,All my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.
6378,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,"If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens."
6379,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,Do you take me for an idiot? In!
6380,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,"I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid."
6381,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS.,"Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer."
6382,kevan lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,King's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force. It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.
6383,tywin lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,Surrender the Iron Throne?
6384,kevan lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates. Stannis will execute them all.
6385,tywin lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,"No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep."
6386,kevan lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.
6387,tywin lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,"Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner."
6389,kevan lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell. The Greyjoys have done us a great favor. Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.
6390,tywin lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,He's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
6391,tywin lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,"We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work."
6397,rorge,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_2,"Look, it's Yoren's little cunt. Used to be a boy, now it's a girl."
6398,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_2,Where's Jaqen?
6399,rorge,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_2,"Don't care. Where's your stick now, bitch? I promised to fuck you with it."
6401,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE,"You need sour cherries to make it right. And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet. That's where the real flavor is. You crush 'em up real fine. And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust."
6402,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE,Where's Jaqen?
6403,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE,How would I know?
6404,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE,I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
6405,gendry,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE,You need him?
6406,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE,He's helping me.
6407,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE,I saw him.
6408,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE,Where?
6409,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE,Where?
6410,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE,Ow!
6411,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE,Where?
6412,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE,They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.
6413,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE,On patrol. Let go of my ears.
6414,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE,What do you want with him anyway?
6415,quorin halfhand,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_1,"Mance is gonna march on the Wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth a thousand fighting against it."
6416,jon snow,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_1,They'll never trust me.
6417,quorin halfhand,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_1,They might. If you do what needs to be done.
6418,jon snow,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_1,What?
6419,quorin halfhand,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_1,(yelling) How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?
6420,jon snow,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_1,I didn't.
6421,quorin halfhand,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_1,"I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard."
6423,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,I like to keep me hands clean.
6424,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,"Yes, but do you have to do it here?"
6425,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,You should start wearing the gold cloak.
6426,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
6427,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common
6428,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,"A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."
6429,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,"Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out."
6430,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
6431,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,"Fine, fine. No gold cloak."
6432,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,What?
6433,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,What?
6434,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,What? What? Why are you staring at me?
6435,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,(scoffs) You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
6436,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
6437,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,Stannis will be here any day.
6438,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,And one of these explains how to beat him?
6439,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,"""An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. "" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh."
6440,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
6441,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
6442,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
6443,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
6444,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,For questioning?
6445,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
6446,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,We talked about this.
6447,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,"Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Food's worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
6448,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,"The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
6449,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,"Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted."
6450,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,(nods)
6451,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,"Ah. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer."
6452,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,"Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land."
6453,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,"And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
6454,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,We could throw books at his men.
6455,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,We don't have that many books.
6456,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,"We don't have that many men, either."
6457,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,What do we have?
6458,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_6,Pig shit.
6459,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,(panting) I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
6460,dolorous edd,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
6461,grenn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse.
6462,dolorous edd,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,You lack imagination.
6463,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,Where do you think Jon is right now?
6464,dolorous edd,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead.
6465,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,"He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter."
6466,grenn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,"Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you."
6467,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
6468,eddison tollett,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,So did his father.
6469,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
6470,dolorous edd,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,Great rangers never get old is the problem. Shit ones neither. It's them in the middle that last a long time.
6471,grenn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,What in seven hells is that?
6472,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.
6473,grenn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,Look.
6474,dolorous edd,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,"If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it."
6475,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,That's a Night's Watch cloak.
6476,grenn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,It's been here a long time.
6477,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,Oh. Must be dragonglass.
6478,grenn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,Dragonglass?
6479,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,The maesters call it obsidian.
6480,grenn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,Why would a brother hide it here?
6481,dolorous edd,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_2,I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
6483,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,I'm sorry. I'll-
6484,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,(annoyed) Where were you?
6485,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,A man has patrol duty.
6486,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone."
6487,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,A girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name.
6488,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
6489,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not."
6490,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.
6491,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,This a man cannot do.
6492,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,You promised you'd help me.
6493,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"Help was not promised, lovely girl. Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name."
6494,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,And you'll kill them? Anybody?
6495,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it."
6496,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,All right. Jaqen H'ghar.
6497,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,A girl gives a man his own name?
6498,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,That's right.
6499,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.
6500,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.
6501,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Un-name me.
6502,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,No.
6503,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Please?
6504,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,I'll un-name you.
6505,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Thank you.
6506,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,If you help me and my friends escape.
6507,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,This would require more than one life. This is not part of our bargain.
6508,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"Fine, Jaqen H'ghar."
6509,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"A girl lacks honor. If I do this thing, a girl must obey."
6510,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,A girl will obey.
6511,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
6512,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","Thank you, Podrick."
6513,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Odd little boy.
6514,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
6515,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",You and Varys both.
6516,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
6517,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",He's only a boy.
6518,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Younger boys are off fighting his war.
6519,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",He's not ready.
6520,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?"
6521,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."
6522,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us."
6523,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Do you think I'm an idiot?
6524,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
6525,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
6526,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
6527,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
6528,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
6529,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Because he doesn't have a cock.
6530,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Neither do you.
6531,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking."
6532,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",It's not that little.
6533,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",(laughs)
6534,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Why are you smiling?
6535,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Because I'm happy.
6536,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",And why are you happy?
6537,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Because I have your little whore.
6538,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",I thought you preferred blondes.
6539,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased."
6540,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Why do you care who I fuck?
6541,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."
6542,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
6543,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time."
6544,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Where did you find her?
6545,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."
6546,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
6547,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me."
6548,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","You don't buy them, you only rent them."
6549,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt."
6550,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
6551,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."
6552,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.
6553,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",I promise I will free you.
6554,ros,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Don't forget me.
6555,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Never.
6556,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS","I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid."
6557,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS",Get out.
6558,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,Shae!
6559,shae,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,I've been waiting all night. What is wrong?
6561,shae,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,Then why do you look sad?
6562,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,We have to be more careful.
6563,shae,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.
6564,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,There are people who want to hurt me.
6565,shae,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,I know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will.
6566,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.
6567,shae,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,I'm yours.
6568,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,Promise me.
6569,shae,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,I'm yours and you are mine.
6570,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,Still no word?
6571,roose bolton,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell. Once he captures the castle
6572,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle
6573,roose bolton,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
6574,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
6575,roose bolton,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,"A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much-"
6576,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,Any Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
6577,roose bolton,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.
6578,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,"Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace."
6579,roose bolton,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,My lady.
6580,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,How are you?
6581,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
6582,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.
6583,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.
6584,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,You have every right. You're a king.
6585,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,That's not the kind of king I want to be.
6586,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,What kind do you want to be?
6587,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
6588,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,"I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry."
6589,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,I'd like to hear you play the harp.
6590,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,"No. No, you would not."
6591,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
6592,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,"When I was twelve, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on."
6593,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
6594,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS,I don't want you to marry her. But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

6598,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT",Shut up. What did you bring?
6599,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT",The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages.
6600,gendry,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT",What did he want us to do about those guards?
6601,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT","He didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates."""
6602,gendry,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT",What about the guards?
6603,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT",He didn't say anything about the guards.
6604,gendry,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT","What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think?"
6605,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT",We have to trust him.
6606,gendry,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT",Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.
6607,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT",I want to go back to the kitchens.

6613,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,"Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace."
6615,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,"I admire you, Ser Davos."
6616,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,"I thank you, Your Grace."
6617,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,"Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag."
6618,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,"My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me."
6619,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,Do you? Why?
6620,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,My father was a crabber.
6621,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,And?
6622,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,"Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink."
6623,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
6624,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.
6625,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
6626,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,Some are happy to do it to my face.
6627,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,"We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men."
6628,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,"No one has forgotten, Your Grace."
6629,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
6630,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,He was only a boy.
6631,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
6632,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,(exhales)
6633,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,"First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."
6634,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,"And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe."
6635,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
6636,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,I was relieved they did not.
6637,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,"Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
6638,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,"Your Grace, I pray I serve you well."
6639,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET,I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
6640,joffrey baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.
6641,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell."
6642,joffrey baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.
6643,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?"
6644,joffrey baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him."
6645,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you."
6646,joffrey baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
6647,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,Imagine Stannis' terror.
6648,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,I am trying.
6649,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
6650,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."
6651,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
6652,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"I wish we could, too."
6653,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,What do you want? Tell me.
6654,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"If we're going to play, you'll have to start."
6655,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock."
6656,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,A most highborn plumber.
6657,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
6658,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game."
6659,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,I do. Last thing I expected.
6660,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,And you play it well.
6661,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
6662,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
6663,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?"
6664,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats."
6665,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,We should sail there immediately.
6666,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives."
6667,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
6668,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide."
6669,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_8,"One game at a time, my friend."
6670,jorah mormont,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_2,"Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow."
6671,daenerys targaryen,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_2,Astapor?
6672,jorah mormont,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_2,We cannot stay here.
6673,daenerys targaryen,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_2,They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
6674,jorah mormont,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_2,"They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die."
6675,daenerys targaryen,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_2,You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
6676,jorah mormont,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_2,"You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve."
6677,daenerys targaryen,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_2,"Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there."
6678,jorah mormont,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_2,"That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong."
6679,daenerys targaryen,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_2,And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
6680,jorah mormont,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_2,"Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face."
6681,daenerys targaryen,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_2,They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.
6682,jorah mormont,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_2,(nods)
6683,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_8,We should bury them.
6684,dagmer,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_8,I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message.
6685,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_8,"If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer."
6686,dagmer,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_8,What's this?
6687,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_8,Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.
6688,dagmer,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_8,His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now.
6689,dagmer,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_8,"His wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him."
6690,osha,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS,Got as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
6691,luwin,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS,You're right so far.
6692,osha,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS,Who was that out there hung up at the gates?
6693,luwin,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS,Must have been the farmer's boys.
6694,osha,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS,He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
6695,luwin,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS,They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.
6696,osha,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS,They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.
6697,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,That's it. The tide's against us.
6698,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,"Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates."
6699,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,You're coming home.
6700,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,King's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.
6701,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,"This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain."
6702,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,"Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment."
6703,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,"Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand."
6704,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,Gods be good.
6705,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,"God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us."
6706,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,But not over them?
6707,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,"Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike."
6708,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,"Well, first, we have to put it there."
6709,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,Our ships outnumber theirs ten-to-one.
6710,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,"Our army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire."
6711,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE SEA AT NIGHT,I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.
6712,shae,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1","Are you afraid, my lion?"
6713,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1","If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."
6714,shae,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",I won't let them hurt you.
6715,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
6716,shae,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",It is now.
6717,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",You can't fuck your way out of everything.
6718,shae,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.
6719,pycelle,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS,"As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war."
6720,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS,Your words are always wise and measured.
6721,pycelle,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS,"If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King"
6722,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS,You brought me something?
6723,pycelle,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS,"Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however-"
6724,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS,I know what ten drops will bring.
6725,pycelle,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS,"Your Grace, if I may ask-"
6726,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS,You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
6727,pycelle,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS,Yes. A siege is very-
6728,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS,"Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many."
6729,pycelle,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS,Your Grace.
6731,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,To the boys!
6734,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,Drunk Lannisters.
6736,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,Thank you very much.
6738,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,"Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker."
6740,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
6741,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,"Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-"
6742,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,"Eh, you don't want to know about the third time."
6744,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
6745,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,"Welcome, friends. This round's on me."
6746,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,(whispering) I don't think he likes me.
6747,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,You think you're a hard man?
6748,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,I know it.
6749,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
6750,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,"Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me."
6751,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,Only smaller.
6752,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,And quicker. Eh?
6753,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
6754,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,Aye I expect he will someday.
6756,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_9,One more drink before the war? Shall we?
6757,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,"I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege."
6758,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,A wedding.
6759,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,"Exactly. Podrick, is that it?"
6760,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,"""Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town."
6761,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
6762,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
6763,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,Do you trust him?
6764,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,"Oddly enough, I do."
6765,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,Good.
6766,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,The map you asked for.
6767,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.
6768,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
6769,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,"I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
6770,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,"That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord."
6771,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,"Well, I'm not."
6772,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,"For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai."
6773,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,What of it?
6774,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,"You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
6775,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,"Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
6776,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
6777,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,"Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself."
6778,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,"And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut."
6779,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,"No, I don't believe you have."
6780,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs,"One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him."
6781,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET,They're welcoming the new king.
6782,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET,I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.
6783,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET,Drums!
6784,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"Remember, wait till the ships-"
6785,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,The ships are in the bay.
6786,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,They must be far enough in-
6787,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?"
6788,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
6789,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
6790,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,Don't get killed.
6791,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"Nor you, my friend."
6792,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"Oh, are we friends now?"
6793,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
6794,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"Enhances it, really."
6795,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword."
6796,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,Been spending time with fancy folks.
6797,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,Lady Sansa and Sheila.
6798,shae,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,Shae.
6799,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast."
6800,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off."
6801,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,Sansa.
6802,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"Always been a great romantic, my nephew."
6803,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"Sansa, come here."
6804,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"I will pray for your safe return, my lord."
6805,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,Will you?
6806,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,Just as I pray for the king's.
6807,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"Stay safe, my lady."
6808,shae,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"And you, my lion."
6809,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,Your king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss.
6810,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it."
6811,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.
6812,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,Will you slay him yourself?
6813,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
6814,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
6815,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
6816,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender."
6817,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too."
6818,shae,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,Some of those boys will never come back.
6819,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.
6820,shae,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_10,"Shh. Come, my lady."
6821,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL,Where's our fleet?
6822,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL,On the way.
6823,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL,Why isn't it here now? They're coming.
6824,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL,"Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question."
6825,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL,The king has asked you a question.
6826,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL,"Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy."
6827,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL,The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king-
6828,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL,"If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought."
6829,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL,"That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet."
6830,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_1,Where are their ships?
6831,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_1,It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
6832,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_1,Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.
6833,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_1,"If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied."
6834,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_1,Maybe.
6835,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
6836,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
6837,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,I doubt it.
6838,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,Maybe she's jealous of you.
6839,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,Why would she be jealous?
6840,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,Sansa.
6841,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,"I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?"
6842,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,Yes.
6843,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,"Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine."
6844,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,"I'm not thirsty, Your Grace."
6845,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,So? I didn't offer you water.
6846,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,What's he doing here?
6847,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,"Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
6848,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,But we have guards to defend us.
6849,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,"Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors."
6850,gold cloak,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
6851,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
6852,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
6853,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,You said he was here to protect us.
6854,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST,He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.
6855,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR,There they are.
6856,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR,Archers to their marks.
6860,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR,Hold fast.
6862,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR,What are you doing? We need to attack them.
6863,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR,Hold fast.
6866,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR,There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?
6867,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_2,There's only one ship.
6868,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_2,"Archers, stand to! Man the below! Nock."
6870,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_2,Draw! Hold.
6872,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_2,(confused) There's no one on board.
6875,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_3,Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!
6876,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_4,Matthos! Get down!
6877,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_6,Prepare to land.
6879,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_6,The dwarf has played his little trick.
6881,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_6,He can only play it once.
6883,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_6,Thousands.
6884,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_6,Come with me and take this city!
6885,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"Sansa, come here, little dove."
6886,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,My queen.
6887,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,What are you doing?
6888,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,Praying.
6889,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for?"
6890,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,For the gods to have mercy on us all.
6891,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,Oh. On all of us?
6892,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"Yes, Your Grace."
6893,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,Even me?
6894,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"Of course, Your Grace."
6895,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,Even Joffrey?
6896,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,Joffrey is my-
6897,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four."
6898,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,Your father doesn't believe in the gods?
6899,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much."
6900,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,One for her.
6901,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,Here. Sit. Drink.
6902,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"Not like that. Drink, girl."
6903,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.
6904,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.
6905,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits."
6906,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,And if the city should fall?
6907,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse."
6908,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink."
6909,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten."
6911,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_4,"He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon."
6912,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_4,They're coming. They're coming ashore.
6913,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_4,Rain fire on them.
6915,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_4,There are too many.
6916,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_4,"Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now."
6917,podrick payne,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_4,"Yes, my lord."
6918,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,BELOW THE HARBOR WALL,"Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat. You, too."
6919,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,BELOW THE HARBOR WALL,"Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts."
6927,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_7,"To the Mud Gate, go now!"
6929,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,INSIDE THE HARBOR WALL,"Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse."
6930,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,"When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired."
6931,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,You were Robert's queen.
6932,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.
6933,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,Pretty.
6934,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,"That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend."
6935,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?
6936,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,"A few weeks, Your Grace."
6937,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,When did you leave Lorath?
6938,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
6939,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,(smiles)
6940,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?
6941,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,"Ten years ago, Your Grace."
6942,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,"From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?"
6943,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,"Shae, Your Grace."
6944,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,"Tell us a story, Shae."
6945,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,"When I was thireen, I-"
6946,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,Your Grace!
6947,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,What news?
6948,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,"The Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls."
6949,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,Where is Joffrey?
6950,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
6951,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,Bring him back inside at once.
6952,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,Your Grace-
6953,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,What?
6954,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,The king's presence is good for morale.
6955,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,Bring him back to his chambers now.
6956,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,Not here?
6957,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?
6958,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,"No, but I-"
6959,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,Now!
6960,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_2,"When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive."
6963,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,STANNIS ON THE HARBOR SHORE,Get the ladders up!
6965,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL,Someone bring me a drink.
6966,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL,Fuck the water. Bring me wine.
6967,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL,"Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?"
6968,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL,"Eat shit, dwarf."
6969,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL,You're on the wrong side of the wall.
6970,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL,I lost half my men. The Blackwater's on fire.
6971,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL,"Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight!"
6972,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL,"You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city."
6973,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL,Fuck the Kingsguard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king.
6983,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL,"Your Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep."
6984,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL,"If you won't defend your own city, why should they?"
6985,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL,What would you have me do?
6986,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL,Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
6987,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL,What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me?
6988,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL,"She did not say, Your Grace."
6990,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL,"Ser Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my uncle and represent the king on the field of battle."
6991,mandon moore,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL,(nods)
6999,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL,I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!
7002,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL,"Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?"
7004,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL,There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
7006,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1,"Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape."
7008,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_2,Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.
7009,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,"The battle is lost, Your Grace. Stannis' troops are at the gates. When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart."
7010,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,Where is my son?
7011,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,I want to escort him back to the battle.
7012,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,Why do I care what you want? Bring me-
7013,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,Now listen to me-
7014,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,"Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy..."
7016,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,You must go. Run to your chamber and bar your door. Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.
7017,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,Come with me.
7018,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,I need to say goodbye to someone.
7019,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,The queen said they'd rape everyone.
7020,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,No one is raping me.
7021,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,Go. Run.
7022,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS,The lady is starting to panic.
7023,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS,What are you doing here?
7024,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS,Not here for long. I'm going.
7025,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS,Where?
7026,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS,"Someplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be."
7027,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS,What about the king?
7028,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS,He can die just fine on his own.
7029,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS,I can take you with me. Take you to Winterfell.
7030,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS,I'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home?
7031,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS,I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.
7032,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS,Look at me. Stannis is a killer. The Lannisters are killers. Your father was a killer. Your brother is a killer. Your sons will be killers someday. The world is built by killers. So you'd better get used to looking at them.
7033,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS,You won't hurt me.
7034,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS,"No, little bird, I won't hurt you."
7037,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL_2,Attack!
7040,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL_2,"Oh, fuck me."
7041,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM,"Shh! Be calm, my sweet."
7042,tommen baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM,They're still fighting.
7043,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM,No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.
7044,tommen baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM,The Kingswood?
7045,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM,"Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things."
7046,tommen baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM,Like what?
7047,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM,Like stags.
7048,tommen baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM,Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass.
7049,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM,And wolves.
7050,podrick payne,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR SHORE_1,My lord.
7051,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR SHORE_1,"He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, ""You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid."""
7052,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1,"""For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head."""
7053,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_2,"And the cub said, ""Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"""
7054,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_2,"""Yes,"" said his mother. ""You will be strong and fierce just like your father."""
7055,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_3,"""I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you."""

7058,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE HARBOR SHORE_4,No!
7059,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_4,Father.
7060,tywin lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_4,The battle is over. We have won.

7066,pycelle,2,20,valar morghulis,KING'S LANDING_11,Would you like something for the pain?
7067,tyrion lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,KING'S LANDING_11,What happened?
7068,pycelle,2,20,valar morghulis,KING'S LANDING_11,The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.
7069,tyrion lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,KING'S LANDING_11,Where am I?
7070,pycelle,2,20,valar morghulis,KING'S LANDING_11,"These are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King."

7078,joffrey baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,"Your house has come to our aid. The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I. If your family would ask anything of me, ask it, and it shall be yours."
7079,loras tyrell,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,"Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before... She remains innocent. I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our houses."

7081,margaery tyrell,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,"With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me."
7082,joffrey baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,"I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady. It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another. A king must keep his word."
7083,cersei lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,"Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside."
7085,joffrey baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,"I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow."
7086,pycelle,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,"Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness. I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods."
7087,joffrey baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,"The gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister. You will be my queen and I will love you from this day until my last day."
7088,petyr baelish,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,My lady. My sincerest condolences.
7089,sansa stark,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,They're right. I'm not good enough for him.
7090,petyr baelish,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,"You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well."
7091,sansa stark,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,"But, if he's not marrying me-"
7092,petyr baelish,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,"He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home."
7093,sansa stark,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,King's Landing is my home now.
7094,petyr baelish,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_3,Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.
7095,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,Come in. Make yourself comfortable.
7096,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,"That doesn't look very comfortable. Here, watch me."
7097,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,"No need for that, my dear."
7098,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,You sure? Most men like what they see.
7099,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,I'm not like most men.
7100,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,That's what most men say.
7101,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,(laughs)
7102,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,"If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do."
7103,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.
7104,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,Have we met?
7105,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,You wouldn't remember me if we had?
7106,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,I meet a lot of men.
7107,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them.
7108,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,"You're very kind, my lord. Allow me to return the favor."
7109,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.
7110,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,I know who you are.
7111,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,"And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other."
7112,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,How do you know about that?
7113,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,I thought you said you knew who I was.
7114,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,"What can I do for you, Lord Varys?"
7115,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.
7116,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,I'm afraid of him.
7117,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_3,"Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks."
7118,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,"You're a virgin, I take it?"
7119,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,Walk.
7120,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,"Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne."
7121,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,One or two tried.
7122,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,"Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough."
7123,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,Not interested.
7124,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
7125,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,"Ah. ""They lay with lions."" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks."
7126,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.
7127,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.
7128,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,What are you doing?
7129,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,Burying them.
7130,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.
7131,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,I think these women would understand if I don't care what you think.
7134,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,Untie me. Now!
7137,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,Traveling a prisoner.
7140,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,If you've quite finished up-
7141,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,"All right, we'll be going."
7143,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,The Starks.
7145,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
7146,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,"No, stealing is a crime."
7147,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.
7149,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,To Riverrun.
7151,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,"Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in."
7153,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,For stealing a pig?
7154,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.
7158,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,Have you been to Ashemark?
7160,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,Then you don't know me.
7162,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,Is it near Ashemark?
7164,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,I've never been there.
7166,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,I hope you gave them quick deaths.
7169,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
7170,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,"If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it."
7173,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,"He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head."
7175,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,Two quick deaths.
7176,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,Those were Stark men.
7177,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE,"I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay."
7178,catelyn stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT.,Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
7179,robb stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT.,I know that.

7181,robb stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT.,I love her.
7182,catelyn stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT.,I know that seems important to you.
7183,robb stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT.,It is important to me.
7184,catelyn stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT.,"Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer."
7185,robb stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT.,"And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?"
7186,catelyn stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT.,Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?
7187,robb stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT.,Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
7188,catelyn stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT.,"And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing"
7189,robb stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT.,My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.
7190,stannis baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT",You said you saw my victory in the flames.

7192,stannis baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT","The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?"
7193,melisandre,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT",The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
7194,stannis baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT",You claimed to speak for a god.

7205,melisandre,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT",This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king.
7206,stannis baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT","You promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know."

7214,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.
7215,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before
7216,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,"Thank you, wise bald man. Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me."
7217,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,No word from my father?
7218,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,No.

7220,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,You killed all the ravens.

7222,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,"First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, ""Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. ""We never stood a chance against the man who lives here."""
7223,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.
7224,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,"Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father"
7225,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,"I will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man."
7226,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,"Theon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you."

7228,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,Run. Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have twenty men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run.
7229,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,"There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family."
7230,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch.
7231,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,"Once a man has taken the black, he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven."
7232,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it ten feet past the Winterfell gates.
7233,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck...
7234,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,"The Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there."
7235,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.
7236,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.
7237,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,"I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing."
7238,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,"I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet."
7239,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_9,You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.

Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren. Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle."
7247,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING",Mothers will name their sons for us.
7249,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,"WINTERFELL, THE NEXT MORNING",Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.

7453,tormund,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,I smell a crow.
7454,rattleshirt,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,We killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one.
7455,tormund,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,What do we want with a baby crow?
7456,ygritte,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.
7457,tormund,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.
7458,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
7459,tormund,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,"Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?"
7460,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,Jon Snow.
7461,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,Your Grace.
7462,tormund,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,"Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart. ( Laughs. )"

7464,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,"So, you're Ned Stark's bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us."
7465,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,"The girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?"
7466,tormund,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,"Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls."
7467,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
7468,tormund,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.
7469,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead.
7470,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,He was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him?
7471,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
7472,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,Why?
7473,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,He wants me to lead one day.

7477,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,(Hesitates) I want to be free.
7478,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,"No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?"
7479,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
7480,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,You saw what?
7481,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
7482,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?
7483,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,"Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?"
7484,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT,We'll need to find you a new cloak.

7500,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?"
7501,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"No, I don't think so."
7502,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?"
7503,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,They stay outside.

7506,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that."
7507,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
7508,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father."
7509,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me."
7510,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.
7511,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
7512,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,You're meeting Father today?
7513,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,How do you know that?
7514,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?
7515,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came."
7516,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,You're going to make me cry.
7517,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,Why do you care what I want from him?
7518,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,Because you've slandered me to Father before.
7519,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,Slandered? When?
7520,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
7521,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe."
7522,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"I was nine, too."
7523,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"She lost an eye, if I remember correctly."
7524,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again."
7525,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,It's not slander if it's true.
7526,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?
7527,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
7528,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey."
7529,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,Any lies in particular?
7530,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are."
7531,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,Still makes me more clever than you.

7539,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,OUTSIDE TYRION'S CHAMBERS,"That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion."

7545,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING_13,I grow poor protecting you.

7551,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING_13,We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.

7557,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING_13,Which means you can afford it.

7614,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"KING'S LANDING, THE HAND'S CHAMBERS",You brought a whore into my bed.
7615,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"KING'S LANDING, THE HAND'S CHAMBERS",It wasn't your bed at the time.

7620,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"KING'S LANDING, THE HAND'S CHAMBERS",Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
7621,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"KING'S LANDING, THE HAND'S CHAMBERS","I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family.

So tell me what you want."
7623,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"KING'S LANDING, THE HAND'S CHAMBERS","I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles.

7624,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"KING'S LANDING, THE HAND'S CHAMBERS",You want Casterly Rock?

And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock."
7627,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"KING'S LANDING, THE HAND'S CHAMBERS",Why?
7628,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"KING'S LANDING, THE HAND'S CHAMBERS","Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."
7629,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"KING'S LANDING, THE HAND'S CHAMBERS","Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang."
7630,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,Dorne. It's going to Dorne.
7631,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,Why Dorne?
7632,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
7633,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.
7634,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,Don't ruin the game.
7635,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,"I told you, I don't want to play."
7636,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,(pointing to another ship) What about that one there?
7637,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,That one? It's going to Volantis.
7638,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,Why?
7639,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,"Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one."
7640,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
7641,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
7642,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
7643,petyr baelish,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.
7644,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,Lord Baelish.
7645,petyr baelish,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
7646,petyr baelish,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.
7647,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
7648,petyr baelish,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
7649,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,I won't tell anyone.
7650,petyr baelish,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,How do I know?
7651,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,"Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when."
7652,petyr baelish,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,"I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice."
7653,ros,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,You're her handmaiden?
7654,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,Yes. And you're his...?
7655,ros,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,I help manage his affairs.
7656,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,He's an important person.
7657,ros,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,"So is she. I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle. The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset. We've both done rather well, you and I."
7658,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,Yes.
7659,ros,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,Given where we started.
7660,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,And where is that?
7661,ros,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Watch out for her.
7662,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,I always do.
7663,ros,3,21,valar dohaeris,KING'S LANDING SHORE,Watch out for her with him.

7666,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,New Scene_1,We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
7667,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,New Scene_1,The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people.
7668,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,New Scene_1,Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
7669,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,New Scene_1,It's too beautiful a day to argue.
7670,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,New Scene_1,You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas.
7671,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,New Scene_1,"Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ..."
7672,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,New Scene_1,"The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi. You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong. And not before."

7679,stannis baratheon,3,21,valar dohaeris,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM,I am fighting.
7680,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM,By burning prisoners alive?
7681,melisandre,3,21,valar dohaeris,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM,"How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?"
7682,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM,"I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone."
7683,melisandre,3,21,valar dohaeris,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM,I'm not your enemy.
7684,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM,You are my enemy.
7685,melisandre,3,21,valar dohaeris,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM,"Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them."
7686,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM,(gasps)
7687,melisandre,3,21,valar dohaeris,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM,"Don't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true."

7689,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM,(growls) This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons.
7690,stannis baratheon,3,21,valar dohaeris,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM,Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
7691,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM,Your Grace!

7694,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM,She will destroy us all!
7695,melisandre,3,21,valar dohaeris,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM,I will pray for you.

7713,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD,"Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father."
7715,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD,And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him.
7716,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD,"Was your father a soldier, too?"
7717,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD,"You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you."

7723,joffrey baratheon,3,21,valar dohaeris,"JOFFREY'S DINING TABLE, NIGHT","That's a lovely gown, my lady."

7726,joffrey baratheon,3,21,valar dohaeris,"JOFFREY'S DINING TABLE, NIGHT","Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?"

7729,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,"JOFFREY'S DINING TABLE, NIGHT","Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it."
7730,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"JOFFREY'S DINING TABLE, NIGHT",You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
7731,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,"JOFFREY'S DINING TABLE, NIGHT",Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
7732,loras tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,"JOFFREY'S DINING TABLE, NIGHT",Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.
7733,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,"JOFFREY'S DINING TABLE, NIGHT",The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
7734,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"JOFFREY'S DINING TABLE, NIGHT","An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life."
7735,joffrey baratheon,3,21,valar dohaeris,"JOFFREY'S DINING TABLE, NIGHT",My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger.
7736,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"JOFFREY'S DINING TABLE, NIGHT","You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery."
7737,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,"JOFFREY'S DINING TABLE, NIGHT","Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need."

7805,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH,"No, it was the three-eyed raven."
7806,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH,He's back.
7807,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH,"I tried to kill it, but I couldn't. There was a boy."
7808,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH,I don't want to hear about it.
7809,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH,But you asked.
7810,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH,We've got plenty of worries. We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.
7811,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH,I didn't ask for black magic dreams.
7812,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH,"I know you didn't, little lord."
7813,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH,We need to move.
7814,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH,We don't know who might be after us. No one even knows we're alive.
7815,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH,And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you?
7816,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH,No.
7817,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH,"Some good he is, then."
7818,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH,I don't know what other people know and what they don't. I only know the Wall is a long way off.
7819,talisa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER,"My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot. Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds."
7820,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER,Did you ever think you'd marry one?
7821,talisa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER,I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.
7822,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER,Never?
7823,talisa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER,"Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians."
7824,roose bolton,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER,"Pardon me, Your Grace. My queen."
7825,talisa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER,Lord Bolton.
7826,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER,Let me guess which one is the good news.
7827,roose bolton,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER,Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.
7828,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_4,I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.
7829,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_4,We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
7830,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_4,Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
7831,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_4,Something else?
7832,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_4,"By the time Bolton's bastard Ramsay got to Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages."
7833,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_4,Have you received any demands?
7834,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_4,No.
7835,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_4,Have you heard anything from Theon at all?
7836,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON,Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?
7837,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON,I want to do this.
7838,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS,Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?
7839,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS,Yes.
7840,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS,So how shall we pass the time?
7841,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS,By putting one foot in front of the other.
7842,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS,It's going to be a very dull walk.
7843,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS,I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.
7844,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS,"You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword."
7845,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS,"If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman."
7846,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS,All the good it's done her.
7847,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
7848,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER","Not your concern, Kingslayer."
7849,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
7850,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",How would you know?
7851,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
7852,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",Move.
7853,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",Were you pledged to Stannis?
7854,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER","Gods, no."
7855,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER","Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal."
7856,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",Shut your mouth.
7857,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER","Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you."
7858,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER","I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king."
7859,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",Sounds like you quite fancied him.
7860,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",I did not fancy him.
7861,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER","Oh, gods, you did."
7862,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER","Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid."
7863,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
7864,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",I'm not interested in foul rumors.
7865,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.
7866,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",Shut your mouth!
7867,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER","I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love."
7869,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",South. You?
7871,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER","No, you really can't."
7873,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",And you.
7874,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",He knows who I am.
7875,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",He doesn't.
7876,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",Maybe you're right.  But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?
7877,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.
7878,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER",More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
7879,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",Make it tighter here.
7880,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",That's better. It makes you look very strong.
7881,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others.
7883,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",Bloody flowers. On the king.
7884,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.
7885,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",Tell me what you think of her.
7886,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",Who?
7887,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",Margaery.
7888,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS","She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century."
7889,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS","It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent."
7890,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS","Yes, she is."
7891,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
7892,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",Not to me.
7893,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.
7894,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
7895,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
7896,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.
7897,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",You need to ask yourself
7898,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",I don't need to do anything.
7899,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS",Better. Much better.
7900,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",I still don't believe it.
7901,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
7902,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
7903,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",Littlefinger's not in love with me.
7904,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",Love is not the thing he wants.
7905,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",He's too old.
7906,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?
7907,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",No.
7908,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1","If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me."
7909,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.
7911,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",Send him in.
7912,loras tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",Lady Sansa.
7913,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",Ser Loras.
7914,loras tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1","My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens. May I escort you to them?"
7915,loras tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa."
7916,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose."
7917,loras tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,Of course I did.
7918,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,(to a maid) It's more your color. You take it.
7920,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,(to LORAS) You're such a dear.
7921,loras tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.
7922,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"Thank you, Ser Loras."
7923,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell."
7924,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"Kiss me, child."
7925,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.
7926,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant."
7927,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king."
7928,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras."
7929,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-
7930,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
7931,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?"
7932,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,Lemon cake's my favorite.
7933,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"So we've been told. (To the servant) Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others."
7934,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
7935,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,I haven't had the pleasure.
7936,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey."
7937,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"I-, I-"
7938,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?"
7939,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,Has he ripped out your tongue?
7940,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion"
7941,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?"
7942,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.
7943,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,Bring me some cheese.
7945,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.
7946,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you."
7947,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,My father always told the truth.
7948,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head."
7949,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
7950,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,Go on.
7951,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.
7952,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her."
7953,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it."
7954,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,He's a monster.
7955,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,Ah. That's a pity.
7956,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"Please, don't stop the wedding."
7957,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS,"Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese."
7958,rickard karstark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,We're at war. This march is a distraction.
7959,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.
7960,rickard karstark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
7961,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,No.
7962,rickard karstark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,Then it's a distraction.
7963,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.
7964,rickard karstark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,"Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference."
7965,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,Have you lost faith in our cause?
7966,rickard karstark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,"If it's revenge, I still got faith in it."
7967,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,If you no longer believe-
7968,rickard karstark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,I can believe till it snows in Dorne. Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.
7969,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,You don't think we can win?
7970,rickard karstark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,"May I speak my mind, Your Grace?"
7971,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,"Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?"
7972,rickard karstark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS,I think you lost this war the day you married her.
7973,talisa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH","Whoa, whoa."
7975,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH",You're afraid of her. And she knows it.
7976,talisa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH","I'm not afraid of her. May I help you, Lady Stark?"
7977,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH",No.
7978,talisa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH","I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-"
7979,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH",You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.
7980,talisa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH",You've made them before?
7981,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH",Twice.

7983,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH",After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.

7985,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH","Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering."
7986,talisa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH",Which boy?
7987,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH","Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us."
7988,talisa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH",And he lived.
7989,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH",And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.

7996,mance rayder,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,"Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?"
7997,jon snow,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,No.
7998,mance rayder,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south. Because that's the truth.

That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole. Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to."

8032,rast,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_8,What am I supposed to do?
8033,jeor mormont,3,22,dark wings dark words,NORTH OF THE WALL_8,"Make sure he gets back alive. If he doesn't, you don't. Move on!"

8048,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Would you please shut up about it?
8049,gendry,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.
8050,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,I'm not listening.
8051,gendry,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.
8052,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Shut up.
8053,gendry,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,You could have picked Tywin Lannister.
8054,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,"Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?"
8055,gendry,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,But you could have ended the war.
8056,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Where are we going?
8057,gendry,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,North.
8058,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,"If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now."
8059,gendry,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Maybe we already passed it.
8060,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,"It's a hundred feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather, he's a lord. He'll protect us."
8061,gendry,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Could be a minstrel.
8062,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Shut up.
8063,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,A lion still has claws...
8064,hot pie,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,"A minstrel's got gold sometimes. We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food."
8065,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Shh.
8066,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,"And so he spoke, and so he spoke"
8067,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?
8068,anguy,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,"Just a dirty little cub, I think."
8069,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Loose a few more shafts.
8070,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Don't.
8071,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,"Put the sword down, girl."
8072,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you.
8073,anguy,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Generous.
8074,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,You're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy?
8075,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,What friends?
8076,anguy,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,The fat to your left and the lad beside him.
8077,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal?
8078,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Who are you?
8079,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.
8080,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,"No, who do you fight for?"
8081,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
8082,hot pie,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.
8083,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,"You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way."
8084,anguy,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,"Here's the thing, fat"
8085,anguy,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,"When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head. So I advise you move, because I'm done talking."
8086,anguy,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Half the country's starving and look at this one.
8087,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.
8088,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",My lion.
8089,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.
8090,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",But you said I should come to you with any problems.
8091,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",Did anyone see you? No.
8092,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",No.
8093,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.
8094,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",All right. What is this problem?
8095,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him."
8096,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",Baelish doesn't have friends.
8097,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",I don't know her name.
8098,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","Oh, Ros? The redhead?"
8099,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",How do you know her?
8100,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.
8101,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",She's a whore.
8102,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things."
8103,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",You fucked her.
8104,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice."
8105,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else."
8106,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",And was she good? Did you like her?
8107,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?"
8108,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
8109,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
8110,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",We have to protect her.
8111,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name."
8112,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?"
8113,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you."
8114,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",You pervert. You want her? This child?
8115,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",I don't even want to talk about her.
8116,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",But you are.
8117,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",Only because you're making me.
8118,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
8119,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
8120,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."
8121,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","Hmm, yes."
8122,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",Now do you think I'm cruel?
8123,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.
8124,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.
8126,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Send her in.
8127,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1","You wanted to see me, Your Grace?"
8128,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
8129,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1","That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want."
8130,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.
8131,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.
8132,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?
8133,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1","Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all."
8134,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
8135,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.
8136,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",You failed to do this.
8137,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1","Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace."
8138,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?
8139,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
8140,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",What makes you say this?
8141,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1","Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me."
8142,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1","No, he was a known degenerate."
8143,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1","It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace."
8144,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
8145,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.
8146,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",You are the king.
8147,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Yes. I am.
8148,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
8149,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
8150,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.
8151,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",The bolt goes here.
8152,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",And then you just aim and-
8153,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1","Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman."
8154,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",It's not unheard of.
8155,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",My father would never let me before-
8156,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it?
8157,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",May I? Please.
8158,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
8159,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Could you do it? Could you kill something?.
8160,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1","I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?"
8161,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Yes.
8162,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Would you like to watch me?
8163,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Yes.
8164,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,Stop! Stop!
8165,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,Tell us the truth.
8166,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,(screaming) About what?
8167,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,I don't know what you want.
8168,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,I want the truth.
8169,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,What truth?
8170,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,Why'd you take Winterfell?
8171,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,I took it to-I took it-
8172,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,Who gave the orders?
8173,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,No one. I took it on my own.
8174,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,Why?
8175,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,To take the North while it was vulnerable.
8176,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,What were you going to do once you took it?
8177,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,Hold it. Rule it.
8178,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,Good. That's very good.
8179,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,Why did you do that?
8180,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?
8181,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
8182,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,"(panicking) Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them."
8183,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,What are you doing?
8184,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,Please.
8185,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,"I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off."
8186,ramsay bolton,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,Your sister sent me.
8187,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,Yara?
8188,ramsay bolton,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
8189,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,"No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go."
8190,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,"Rickon, stay with us."
8191,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,It's all right. The wolves will protect him.
8192,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,"You can get inside his head, see through his eyes."
8193,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,Only when I'm asleep.
8194,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.
8195,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-
8196,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,A three-eyed raven?
8197,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,You've seen it?
8198,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?
8199,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,Does it have anything to do with warging?
8200,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,"No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight."
8201,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,Seeing things that haven't happened yet?
8202,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
8203,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,What's he telling him?
8204,meera reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,Why don't you ask?
8205,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,"Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?"
8206,meera reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,Where's the shame in that?
8207,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
8208,meera reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.
8209,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,"When my father died, I dreamt it."
8210,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.
8211,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,"You have the sight, too?"
8212,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,"(Nods) When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry."
8213,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.
8214,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,Yeah.
8215,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,He saved my father's life during the rebellion.
8216,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,"Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too."
8217,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,What else have you seen?
8218,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_3,Only one thing that matters-you.
8220,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,I don't drink ale.
8221,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.
8223,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,"You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-"
8224,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,We're not children.
8225,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,"How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?"
8226,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
8227,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,"A smith, eh? Where'd you train?"
8228,gendry,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
8229,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.
8230,gendry,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,That's because he's twice as good.
8231,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,Aha! A smith and a salesman.
8232,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,Gendry stole us weapons.
8233,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,"Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see."
8234,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
8235,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,My brothers taught me.
8237,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,To your brothers!
8238,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,You can finish your meals before you go. It may be awhile before you see another.
8239,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,You'll free us?
8240,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,I gave you my word.
8241,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,"But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-"
8242,anguy,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,"Hey, hey."
8243,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,Now that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
8244,anguy,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
8245,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,Poor man. You have my sympathy.
8246,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,"Aha, not a man at all. A Hound!"
8247,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,"So good to see you again, Clegane."
8248,sandor clegane,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,Thoros? The fuck you doing here?
8249,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.
8250,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,"A pretty prize, lads."
8252,sandor clegane,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,Girl.
8253,sandor clegane,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN,(to Thoros) What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?
8254,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_2,It's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
8255,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_2,"Silence, Kingslayer."
8256,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_2,"Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river."
8257,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_2,Good luck.
8258,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_2,It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?
8259,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.
8260,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,Be quick about it.
8261,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,I need to rest.
8262,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,Get up.
8263,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,"I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?"
8264,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,Get up now.
8265,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,"Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year."
8266,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,This heel is ruined. There's no way-
8267,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
8268,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.
8269,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.
8270,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,"Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you."
8271,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,"You're good. Graceless, but good."
8272,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,"See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there."
8273,locke,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,"Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman."
8274,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.
8275,locke,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,You sure he's the one?
8277,locke,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,Give the man his silver.
8278,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
8279,locke,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE,"Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours."
8280,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER","If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-"
8281,brynden tully (blackfish),3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER","Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him ""nephew."" He is your king."
8282,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",Robb knows I meant him no disr-
8283,brynden tully (blackfish),3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",You're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
8284,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER","My blunder sent Tywin's mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around."
8285,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
8286,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",I seized an opportunity.
8287,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",What value was the mill?
8288,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
8289,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",Is he there now? Of course not.
8290,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.
8291,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER","I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill."
8292,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.
8293,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",Willem and Martyn Lannister are fourteen years old.
8294,brynden tully (blackfish),3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER","Martyn is fifteen, I believe."
8295,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?
8296,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",No.
8297,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?
8298,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",No.
8299,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",How many men did you lose?
8300,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER","But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-"
8301,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
8302,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",I'm sorry. I didn't know.
8303,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
8304,brynden tully (blackfish),3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",We seem to be running short of patience here.
8305,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER",You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
8306,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER",Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
8307,tywin lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER",What news of Jaime?
8308,tywin lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER","Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?"
8309,varys,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER","We are trying, my lord."
8310,tywin lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER","Try harder. What do we have, then?"
8311,varys,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER","Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name."
8312,tywin lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER","Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn."
8313,petyr baelish,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER","For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord.  Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me."
8314,pycelle,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER",A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
8315,petyr baelish,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER",Titles do seem to breed titles.
8316,tywin lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER",You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
8317,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER","Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended."
8318,tywin lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER",Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
8319,cersei lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER",(chuckles)
8320,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER",Master of Coin?
8321,tywin lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER",It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
8322,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER","I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it."
8323,cersei lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER",I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
8324,pycelle,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER","Hear, hear."
8326,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,"I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us."
8327,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,You were armed when we were taken.
8328,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
8329,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,"All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable."
8330,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.
8331,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.
8332,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,You were not beating me.
8333,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
8334,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,"When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist."
8335,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,Would I?
8336,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,They'll knock your teeth out.
8337,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,You think I care about my teeth?
8338,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,"No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?"
8339,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,What does it matter?
8340,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.
8341,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_2,"If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted?"

8344,thoros,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_3,Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
8345,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_3,Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
8346,thoros,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_3,"You're not our prisoner, little lady."
8347,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_3,What am I?
8348,thoros,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_3,Our guest. No one's put any chains on you.

8350,thoros,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_3,These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter. You're lucky we found you.

8353,sandor clegane,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_3,A coward's weapon. I like to fight up close. I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.
8354,anguy,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_3,Why? So you can kiss him?
8355,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_3,You remember the last time you were here?

8362,gendry,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_3,You're what?
8363,hot pie,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_3,"I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better. Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him. Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king. I'm not a Stark of ""Winterhell""."
8364,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_3,Winterfell.

8380,catelyn stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL,A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.
8381,brynden tully (blackfish),3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL,"It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening."
8382,catelyn stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL,"I've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words-"
8383,brynden tully (blackfish),3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL,Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox. I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience.
8384,catelyn stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL,I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?
8385,brynden tully (blackfish),3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL,"After thirty years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it. He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish. He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with. I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name."
8386,catelyn stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL,"Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say. 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again."
8387,brynden tully (blackfish),3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL,You mustn't think it. We don't know the truth. They could be in hiding. Robb believes they're alive. And he must go on believing. He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail. And you must remain strong for him.

8393,martyn lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON,That he can turn into a wolf at night.
8394,talisa stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON,True.
8395,martyn lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON,And he eats the flesh of his enemies.

8409,mance rayder,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,"It's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont. But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north. And he lost. His best fighting men are dead. And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home. Tormund. Climb the Wall. Take Orell and twenty good men. And take this one. He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us. And if he's useful, good. If not throw him off the Wall. See if crows can fly."

8413,mance rayder,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,Aye. If you do your job. Ah.
8414,orell,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,How will we see your signal?

If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."

8536,daenerys targaryen,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD,And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed.

8546,petyr baelish,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
8547,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,"Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid."
8548,petyr baelish,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,You should have him knighted.
8549,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,If only the Master of Coin had such power.
8550,petyr baelish,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.
8551,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,"Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding."
8552,petyr baelish,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,"Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship."
8553,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,We don't. I did fuck her once.
8554,petyr baelish,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,I know.
8555,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,But we don't.
8556,petyr baelish,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,I know. But how would the queen get that idea?
8557,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
8558,petyr baelish,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,Keep a low profile.
8559,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,"If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are."
8560,petyr baelish,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,"Well, you are richer than I am."
8561,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,Good point.
8562,petyr baelish,3,23,walk of punishment,LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL,"They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores."

Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?"

8588,bronn,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,Let me guess. He's not a magician.
8589,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,No.
8590,bronn,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,He's stealing it?

8592,bronn,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,What's wrong with that?
8593,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,"We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father."
8594,bronn,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,"Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt."
8595,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,"Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive."
8596,bronn,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
8597,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,"Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest."
8598,bronn,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,And what if I don't?
8599,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,"Well, you have to."
8600,bronn,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,But what if I don't?
8601,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,"This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back."
8602,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,"Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?"

8607,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,"Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year."

8609,bronn,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.
8610,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
8611,bronn,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,What did you tell them?
8612,podrick payne,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,I didn't tell them anything.
8613,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,What did you do to them?

8620,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,Is that what you're telling us?
8621,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_2,"Sit down, Podrick."

8644,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERLANDS, NIGHT",They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.
8645,locke,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERLANDS, NIGHT",I know what they are.
8646,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERLANDS, NIGHT","Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched."

8693,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_14,About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?

8695,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_14,I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-
8696,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_14,End your life?
8697,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_14,"I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof."
8698,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_14,Proof? Will there be a trial?
8699,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_14,I need to know.
8700,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_14,"I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?"
8701,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_14,I don't know. Do I?
8702,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_14,"As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."
8703,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_14,"Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-"
8704,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_14,You do not possess at the moment.
8705,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_14,"But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special."
8706,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_14,The sorcerer.
8707,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_14,"Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it."
8708,grenn,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,"When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling."
8709,dolorous edd,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,Or the shit.
8710,grenn,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,"They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it."
8711,dolorous edd,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that.
8712,grenn,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,"But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling."
8713,dolorous edd,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,"Oh, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day."
8714,rast,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,We need to get out of here.
8715,grenn,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,"When the Lord Commander says we go, we go."
8716,rast,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us?
8717,dolorous edd,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,He had no way of knowing.

8719,grenn,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,Craster's been out here surviving.
8720,rast,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?
8721,dolorous edd,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,We're like the sons he never had.
8722,rast,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,"Mormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves."

8724,gilly,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_2,You woke him.
8725,sam,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_2,I'm sorry. He's beautiful.
8726,gilly,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_2,Shh!
8727,sam,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_2,He's beautiful.  Does he have a name?
8728,gilly,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_2,No.
8729,sam,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_2,Are you going to give him one?
8730,gilly,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_2,Why?
8731,gilly,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_2,Here.
8732,sam,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_2,Gilly.
8733,gilly,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_2,You said to hold it for you until you came back. You're back.
8734,sam,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_2,I wanted you to have it.
8735,gilly,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_2,I don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you?
8736,gilly,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_2,I don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.
8737,jojen reed,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"WOODS, SOMEWHERE",You have to go after him.
8738,bran stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"WOODS, SOMEWHERE",How?
8739,jojen reed,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"WOODS, SOMEWHERE",You know how.

8748,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,Is he very large?
8749,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,"No larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was-"
8750,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,Extraordinary.
8751,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men.
8752,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?
8753,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,(nods)
8754,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,What did he do to them?
8755,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,"I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive."
8756,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,So what did they say?
8757,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,They said it was hard to describe.
8758,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
8759,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
8760,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,"Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?"
8761,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,"He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest."
8762,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,What makes you say so?
8763,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,His shipboard inventory.
8764,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
8765,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,Former profession.
8766,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
8767,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
8768,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
8769,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,"He's not interested in them, my lord."
8770,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,How do you know?
8771,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,Because I'm one of his girls.
8772,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_15,Prodigies in odd places indeed.
8773,joffrey baratheon,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR","Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon. It ate her while her son watched. What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there."
8774,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR","The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats seven hundred comfortably."
8775,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.
8776,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",There aren't more than seven hundred people of any importance.
8777,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR","No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the seven hundred to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats."
8778,joffrey baratheon,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR","Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen. Aerion Brightflame, they called him. He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon."

8780,joffrey baratheon,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR","He was wrong. And, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle. Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?"
8781,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre?
8782,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR","Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace. I'd love to see their tombs, really. It's like taking a walk through history."
8783,joffrey baratheon,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",The tomb's just up here.
8784,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",This is so exciting.
8785,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR","You were married here, Your Grace?"
8786,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",Yes.
8787,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",Must seem like only yesterday.
8788,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",Seems like a lifetime ago.
8789,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR","Your husband, was he buried here as well?"
8790,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR","No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End."
8791,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",Such a tragedy.
8792,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",A fairly predictable tragedy. Hunting and drinking don't mix.
8793,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",I should say not. My son's a hunter. It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle.
8794,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year.
8795,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.

8797,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR","I told him to stay out of Robert's Rebellion. He had no business fighting an actual warrior. We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave. But they do seem to yearn for it. We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing."
8798,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",And yet the world belongs to them.
8799,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR","A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind."

8801,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR",The gods have seen fit to make it so.
8802,joffrey baratheon,3,24,and now his watch is ended,THE TOMBS,"My father didn't want them here. He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise."
8803,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,THE TOMBS,"I'm glad he did. I'm sorry, Your Grace. I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this. Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness."
8804,joffrey baratheon,3,24,and now his watch is ended,THE TOMBS,I couldn't agree more.
8805,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,THE TOMBS,"Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold. I've spoken with them. I know how they feel about you. You led the defense of King's Landing. They adore you."
8806,joffrey baratheon,3,24,and now his watch is ended,THE TOMBS,Open the doors.
8807,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,THE TOMBS,Joffrey. Wait.

8822,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,NORTHERN WOODS,She sent you to save me?
8823,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,NORTHERN WOODS,"Yes. I served them, the men who were torturing you. I did what they told me and waited for the right moment."
8824,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,NORTHERN WOODS,Why would you risk your life for me?
8825,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,NORTHERN WOODS,"I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord. I was only a boy when they took you away. My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off. I remember the look on my father's face when he told us, 'That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son.' And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you."
8826,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,NORTHERN WOODS,"Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me. Did he?"
8827,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,NORTHERN WOODS,"I- I don't know, my lord. They- they never told me much."
8828,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",My sister's men are loyal to her. We don't need to hide from them.
8829,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",Not all those are your sister's men. Some of them are loyal to your father.
8830,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",(chuckles)
8831,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",What is it?
8832,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place.
8833,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",What did he tell you to do?
8834,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",Raid fishing villages. He didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark. Ha. I could never be a Stark. Robb Stark always reminded me of that.
8835,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",He lorded it over you?
8836,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",Didn't have to. All he had to do was be. Be who he was born to be. His life fit him better than his clothes. How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? He's the King in the North.
8837,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER","And me my father gave me a choice and I made it. I could never be a Stark. But ironborn, that's what I was born to be. I paid the iron price for Winterfell. I murdered those boys."
8838,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",The Stark boys?
8839,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",Never found them. Just some poor orphans living with a farmer. I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud.
8840,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",Maybe it's not too late.
8841,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",It is. My real father lost his head at King's Landing. I made a choice and I chose wrong. And now I've burned everything down.
8842,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER","Not everything, my lord. She's up here."
8843,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",Yara.
8844,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",Shh. Wait.
8845,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER",I brought him back. He killed the others.

8852,jaime lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT",I don't care about revenge.
8853,brienne of tarth,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT",You coward. A little misfortune and you're giving up.
8854,jaime lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT",Misfor- misfortune?
8855,brienne of tarth,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT",You lost your hand.
8856,jaime lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT",My sword hand. I was that hand.
8857,brienne of tarth,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT",You have a taste- one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit. You sound like a bloody woman.
8858,brienne of tarth,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT",I know what you did for me. You told them Tarth was full of sapphires. It's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water. You knew that. Why did you help me?
8859,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS",You wanted to speak to me?
8860,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS","Yes, about Jaime."
8861,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS",What about him?
8862,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS",I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back.

8867,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS",Whatever I can.

8870,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS",Why?
8871,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS","Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me. Years and years of lectures on family and legacy- the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations- did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them? Living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children?"
8872,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS",All right. Contribute.
8873,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS",The Tyrells are a problem.

8876,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS",Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him. I don't distrust you because you're a woman. I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are. You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.
8877,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS",Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.

8880,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"Another golden rose. How original. I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses. I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear. 'Growing strong.' Ha! The dullest words of any house. 'Winter is coming!' Now that's memorable. 'We do not sow.' Strong. Strong. Those are houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts. But a golden rose growing strong- ha, that strikes fear in the heart."
8881,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along now. Grow strong."
8882,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence.
8883,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?"
8884,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"A little obvious, perhaps."
8885,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"Oh, no, please. Seduce away. It's been so long. Though I rather think it's all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers. But you've come mincing all this way for something. So?"
8886,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,Might I sit?
8887,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"No. Come, I've heard you're such a clever man. I'm curious why you've sought me out."
8888,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.
8889,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn't I take an interest? She's an interesting girl.
8890,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,Is she?
8891,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"No, not particularly. But she's had an interesting childhood."

8893,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"Come, come. You surrender rather easily. Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too."
8894,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still.
8895,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,Which is Sansa Stark?
8896,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father.
8897,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,"Yes. Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?"
8898,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter.
8899,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,How?
8900,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.
8901,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.
8902,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.
8903,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.
8904,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,"Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him."
8905,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,And why have you come to me with this matter?
8906,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,"Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army?"
8907,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,(laughs)
8908,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,"Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North."
8909,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,"And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket."
8910,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?
8911,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,You must despise him. You're working so hard to undermine him.
8912,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,"Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes."
8913,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,"You are a clever man, Lord Varys."
8914,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution.
8915,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS,"One doesn't need to be clever for that. It's all rather obvious, isn't it?"
8916,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,Ahem. I didn't mean to disturb you.
8917,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,You haven't.
8918,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,"(to the guards) We'd like some privacy, please. If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep. Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names, I'll ask the king to speak with you himself."
8919,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,What did you pray for?
8920,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,I can't tell you.
8921,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,"Why not? I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning. Let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter. Boring and traditional, I'm afraid. And you?"
8922,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,"I'm sorry, I just can't."
8923,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,"My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me. Pig-face, she called me."
8924,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,Pig-face? That's ridiculous.
8925,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,"I think it had something to do with my nose. Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink."
8926,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,(laughs)
8927,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,"So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease. A week after that, she came down with porridge plague."
8928,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,Porridge plague?
8929,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,You don't have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony.
8930,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,But that's awful.
8931,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,"(nods, laughs)"
8932,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,You're- I believed you! Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.
8933,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,"Don't say that. No, you're not."
8934,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,So what happened to Alanna?
8935,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,"Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. It's all terribly frustrating."
8936,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,I'm sure she's jealous of you now. You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.
8937,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,"I want us to be friends, good friends."
8938,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,That would make me very happy.
8939,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,You must see Highgarden. You'd love it there. I know you would. We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon. You should see the costumes. People work on them for months.
8940,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,I- I don't think the queen would let me leave King's Landing.
8941,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE,"The Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen. And if you were to marry Loras... Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it? We would be sisters, you and I. Would you like that?"

9332,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER,There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?
9333,brienne of tarth,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER,Of course.
9334,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER,"The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?"
9335,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER,"First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."
9336,brienne of tarth,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER,If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
9337,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER,Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
9338,brienne of tarth,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER,Help! Help! The Kingslayer!

9348,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON,I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.
9349,davos seaworth,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON,Aye. So they did.

9370,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER","Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings."
9371,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER",You swore an oath.
9372,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER","Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?"
9373,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER",With all my heart.

9375,missandei,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD","Yes, khaleesi. The officers."
9376,daenerys targaryen,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD",(speaks Valyrian) You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?

9378,grey worm,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD",(speaks Valyrian) This one has the honor.
9379,daenerys targaryen,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD",(speaks Valyrian) What is your name?
9380,grey worm,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD",(speaks Valyrian) Grey Worm.
9381,daenerys targaryen,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD",(speaks Valyrian) Grey Worm.
9382,missandei,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD","All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut- Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat. Names that remind them what they are- vermin."
9383,daenerys targaryen,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD","(speaks Valeryan) From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride."
9384,grey worm,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER, FURTHER AHEAD","(speaks Valeryan) ""Grey Worm"" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free."
9385,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",King Robert wanted her dead.
9386,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.
9387,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
9388,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",I didn't sit on the small council.
9389,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-
9390,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1","Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion."
9391,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.
9392,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1","Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over."
9393,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",Mm-hmm.
9394,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1","Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms."
9395,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1","She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience."
9396,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",Which men do you have in mind?
9397,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1","Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years."
9398,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
9399,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
9400,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1","Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man."
9401,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?
9402,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.
9403,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1","If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride."
9404,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",You're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.

9406,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM",You were right.
9407,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM",The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.
9408,talisa stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM",Don't let him.
9409,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM",What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
9410,talisa stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM",We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.
9411,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM","Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children."
9412,talisa stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM",Give them a new purpose.
9413,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM",What?
9414,talisa stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM","Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is."
9415,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM",Here. And we're here. King's Landing-
9416,talisa stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM",What is it?
9417,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM","I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not."
9418,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM",And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.
9419,talisa stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM",Can you do it?
9420,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, WAR ROOM",I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry- Walder Frey.
9421,sansa stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS",He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might
9422,margaery tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS",I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly.
9423,sansa stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS",Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.
9424,margaery tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS",And only one to let you go. Because it will please me.
9425,loras tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS",Squire!

9433,loras tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,LORAS's chambers,That I wanted to.
9434,loras tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,LORAS's chambers,"My lord, I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion."

9450,sansa stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, SHORELINE OVERLOOK","Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare."

9470,tywin lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS,The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.

9472,tywin lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS,There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
9473,tyrion lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS,And how do we do that?
9474,tywin lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS,We find Sansa Stark a different husband.

9485,tywin lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,TYWIN'S CHAMBERS,You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.

So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him."

9726,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM",We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
9727,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM",You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
9728,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM","It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it."
9729,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM",King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.
9730,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM",He'll make time for you.
9731,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM","As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming."
9732,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM",Shall we drink on it?
9733,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM",I don't partake.
9734,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM",You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
9735,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM","Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident."
9736,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM","Oh, she won't be going with you."

9738,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM",You are charged with abetting treason.
9739,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM",I'm afraid I must insist.
9740,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM",You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
9741,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Impossible.
9742,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Why?
9743,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-
9744,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king."
9745,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Old.
9746,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Old?
9747,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely."
9748,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?"
9749,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through."
9750,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
9751,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?"
9752,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Of course.
9753,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",And you never-

9755,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Not once? Not in any way?
9756,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Never.
9757,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets."
9758,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
9759,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out."
9760,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
9761,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation."
9762,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
9763,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","As an authority on myself, I must disagree."
9764,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt."
9765,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take."
9766,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
9767,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children."
9768,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Oh
9769,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
9770,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
9771,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?"
9772,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.

9787,loras tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1","Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so"
9788,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1",I'm very happy about
9789,loras tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1","Uh, yes. I-I am as well."
9790,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1",I feel like I'm in a dream.
9791,loras tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1","Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?"
9792,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1",No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
9793,loras tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_1","It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is."
9794,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
9795,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,We can have them both killed.
9796,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
9797,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
9798,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,On a boat you built.
9799,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
9800,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
9801,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,"I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate."
9802,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
9803,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,"The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot."
9804,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,What do you want me to say?
9805,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
9806,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
9807,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
9808,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,"Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands."
9809,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,"You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels."
9810,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,"When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere."
9811,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,"Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
9812,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK,Who's going to tell her?

9814,shae,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,I don't think they will even notice it.
9815,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,"You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade."
9816,shae,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,I'm sure he does.
9817,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,Will they let me invite my family?
9818,shae,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,They haven't asked my opinion.
9819,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,But do you think they will?
9820,shae,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,No.
9822,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,"I beg your pardon, my lady."
9823,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,"Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding."
9824,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,"Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
9825,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,Of course.
9826,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,"Alone, if I may."
9827,shae,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,Why do you need to speak to her alone?
9828,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,"Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
9829,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
9830,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,"It's all right, really."
9831,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.

9834,varys,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_4,"Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice."
9835,petyr baelish,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_4,"Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want."
9836,varys,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_4,"Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?"
9837,petyr baelish,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_4,"You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience."
9838,varys,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_4,I did what I did for the good of the realm.
9839,petyr baelish,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_4,The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
9840,varys,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_4,But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
9841,petyr baelish,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_4,Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
9842,petyr baelish,3,26,the climb,JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1,(voice over) Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
9843,petyr baelish,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_2","(voice over) And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is."

9847,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,"When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad."
9848,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
9849,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,"Most of the time, yes."
9850,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,How do the men holding the banners fight?
9851,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,"They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil."
9852,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,"And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?"
9853,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
9854,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,So what good are they?
9855,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,They help the men march.
9856,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,How?
9857,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,"Well, it's- it's the rhythm."
9858,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,"Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming."
9859,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,"No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."

9863,orell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,"Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are."
9864,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
9865,orell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE NORTH_4,"People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her."

9893,talisa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER",Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?
9894,robb stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER",I will.
9895,talisa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER",I promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild.
9896,robb stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER","What, now? Are you certain?"
9897,talisa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER",Are you angry with me?
9898,robb stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER",Angry? You're my queen.
9899,talisa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER",And I have your little prince or princess inside me.
9900,robb stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER",Maybe one of each.
9901,talisa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER",Don't get greedy.
9902,talisa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER",Can you leave the war for one night?
9903,robb stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER",I love you. Do you hear me? I love you.
9904,tormund,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, DAY",Most men fuck like dogs.
9905,tormund,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, DAY","No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig. (laughs) Come on! Hey, come on."
9906,orell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER","You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?"
9907,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER","No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks."
9908,orell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER","I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls."
9909,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER","What, you're jealous?"
9910,orell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER",Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own.
9911,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER",And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.
9912,orell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER",You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him?
9913,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER",(nods)
9914,orell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER",'Cause he's pretty?  Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
9915,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER",Don't touch me.
9916,orell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER",You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.
9917,sansa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3","Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns."
9918,margaery tyrell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",Come on. Come walk with me.
9919,margaery tyrell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3","I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother."
9920,margaery tyrell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
9921,sansa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
9922,margaery tyrell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
9923,sansa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",No.
9924,margaery tyrell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",Has he been kind to you?
9925,sansa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",He's tried.
9926,margaery tyrell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3","You don't want him, though."
9927,sansa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",He's a Lannister.
9928,margaery tyrell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3","Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?"
9929,sansa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.
9930,margaery tyrell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3","My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?"
9931,sansa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",My son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-
9932,margaery tyrell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",If it's the pain you're worried about-
9933,sansa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
9934,margaery tyrell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3","What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar."
9935,sansa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",He's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.
9936,margaery tyrell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3","Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced."
9937,sansa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",And that's a good thing?
9938,margaery tyrell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3","It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice."
9939,sansa stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
9940,margaery tyrell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3","Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me."
9941,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5",She's a child.
9942,bronn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5",She's a foot taller than you.
9943,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5",A tall child.
9944,bronn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5",What's the youngest you've ever had?
9945,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5",Not that young.
9946,bronn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5",How much older?
9947,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5",Older.
9948,bronn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5","You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem."
9949,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5",Shae isn't going to like it.
9950,bronn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5",Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
9951,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5",I should never have told you about that.
9952,bronn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5","You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own."
9953,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5",Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
9954,bronn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5","You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. (chuckles) You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it."
9955,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5",I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.
9956,bronn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_5",You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.
9957,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",Your Grace.
9958,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",Grandfather.
9959,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",You wanted to speak to me?
9960,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.
9961,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM","You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them."
9962,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.
9963,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",Of course.
9964,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.
9965,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM","I have, yes."
9966,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",May I ask why?
9967,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM","The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively."
9968,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM","So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?"
9969,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",We could arrange to have you carried.
9970,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
9971,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",Where did you hear about this?
9972,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",Is it true?
9973,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",Apparently so.
9974,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",Don't you think we ought to do something about it?
9975,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM","When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple."
9976,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
9977,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM","Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us."
9978,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
9979,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
9980,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",But I haven't been counseled.
9981,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",You are being counseled at this very moment.
9982,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM",I should be consulted about such things.
9983,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM","From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace."

9985,barristan selmy,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI","The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them."
9986,jorah mormont,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI","On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man."
9987,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI",I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
9988,jorah mormont,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI","We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne."
9989,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI",How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
9990,jorah mormont,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI",Two hundred thousand if not more.
9991,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI",Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city.
9992,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI","(speaks Valyrian) Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor."
9993,missandei,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,"Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace."

9995,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,You may approach. Sit.
9996,missandei,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,Will the noble lord take refreshment?
9997,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,(nods)
9998,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,"Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi."
9999,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
10000,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,"If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people."
10001,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.
10002,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
10003,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,My ship?
10004,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,"Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require."
10005,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,And what do you ask in return?
10006,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
10007,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,I have a gift for you as well. Your life.
10008,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,My life?
10009,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,"And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
10010,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,"You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well."
10011,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,You swore me safe conduct.
10012,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,"I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother."
10013,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,Take the gold.
10014,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,"My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out."
10015,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,(speaks Valerian)
10016,barristan selmy,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.
10017,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?
10018,jorah mormont,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI,I don't know.

10023,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2",You could buy a ship with these.
10024,shae,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2",Do I need a ship?
10025,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2",What?
10026,shae,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2",Am I going somewhere?
10027,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2",Of course you're not going anywhere.
10028,shae,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2","So, am I invited to your wedding?"
10029,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2",I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
10030,shae,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2",No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.
10031,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2","That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire."
10032,shae,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2",Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
10033,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2",I don't have a choice. My father-
10034,shae,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2",Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
10035,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2",What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
10036,shae,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2",And I'm Shae the funny whore.
10037,tyrion lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_2",My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.

10211,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP","You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long."
10212,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP","I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further."
10213,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD","How is the pain, my lord?"
10214,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
10215,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD","Well, we've stymied the corruption."
10216,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD","Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man."
10217,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",All the good it's done me.
10218,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
10219,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD","Faint praise, my lord."
10220,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
10221,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD","No, my lord. That's not my weakness."
10222,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",What is?
10223,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
10224,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",You performed experiments on living men.
10225,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",On dying men.
10226,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",With their permission?
10227,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
10228,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD","Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside."
10229,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD","How many men have you killed, my lord?"
10230,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",I don't know.
10231,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",Fifty? A hundred?
10232,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",(shakes his head)
10233,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",Countless.
10234,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",Countless has a nice ring to it.
10235,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",And how many lives have you saved?
10236,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
10237,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
10238,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",A fair offer.
10239,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",A fair offer. Locke won't take it.
10240,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",Why not?
10241,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
10242,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",(sighs)
10243,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",He feels he's being cheated.
10244,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",They'd be fools to kill her.
10245,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD","These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much."
10246,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",We have to return to Harrenhal.
10248,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",I've left something behind.
10250,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",And what are those orders?
10252,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",You think you'll get a reward.
10254,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD","You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off."
10256,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD",Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.
10257,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,Whoa.
10259,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,Be quiet.
10262,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,"Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight."
10263,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,A wooden sword?
10264,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,I thought you'd gone.
10265,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,You gave her a wooden sword.
10266,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,We've only got one bear.
10267,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,"I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there."
10268,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
10269,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.
10270,brienne of tarth,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,Ah!
10271,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,Get behind me.
10272,brienne of tarth,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,I will not.
10273,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
10275,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,Pull her up.
10276,brienne of tarth,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,Hold my legs.
10277,brienne of tarth,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,Pull him up!
10278,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,The bitch stays.
10279,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
10280,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.
10281,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton?  Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
10282,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL,"Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires."
10283,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS, MORNING","I'll give you one try, girl."
10284,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS, MORNING","Kill me and you're free. But if I live, I'll break both your hands. Go on, hit me. Hit me hard."
10285,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER","Sulk all you want. The truth is, you're lucky. You don't want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you."
10286,arya stark,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER",There's no one worse than you.
10287,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER","Ha, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them."
10288,arya stark,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER",You're lying.
10289,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER","Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open."
10290,arya stark,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER",Is that the Blackwater?
10291,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER",The Blackwater?  Where do you think I'm taking you?
10292,arya stark,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER",Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
10293,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER",Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.
10294,arya stark,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER",But why?
10295,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER",Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
10296,arya stark,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER",Why would they be at the Twins?
10297,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER",Those outlaws you love so much never told you?  The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
10298,barristan selmy,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.
10299,jorah mormont,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
10300,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,You know these men?
10301,jorah mormont,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,"Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, ""The Titan's Bastard."""
10302,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,Is he more titan or bastard?
10303,jorah mormont,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,"He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are."
10304,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,How many?
10305,barristan selmy,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,"Two thousand, Your Grace. Armored and mounted."
10306,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,Enough to make a difference?
10307,barristan selmy,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,(nods)
10308,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
10309,jorah mormont,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,I imagine you're right.
10310,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
10311,jorah mormont,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,He may not agree to meet.
10312,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_2,He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
10313,barristan selmy,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,"Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and-"
10314,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,Daario Naharis
10315,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,You are the Mother of Dragons?  I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
10316,jorah mormont,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,Mind your tongue.
10317,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
10318,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,"(laughs) You, slave girl, bring wine."
10319,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,We have no slaves here.
10320,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.
10321,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,"Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?"
10322,barristan selmy,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,"Under two thousand, Your Grace."
10323,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,"We have more, don't we?"
10324,barristan selmy,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,Ten thousand Unsullied.
10325,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,"I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us."
10326,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have eight thousand Unsullied.
10327,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,You're very young to be a captain.
10328,prendahl na ghezn,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.
10329,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,"Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side."
10330,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
10331,jorah mormont,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
10332,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,Or you could fight for me.
10333,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.
10334,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,I would pay you as much and more.
10335,prendahl na ghezn,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,"Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again."
10336,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
10337,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.
10338,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,"A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide."
10339,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.
10340,grey worm,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,"(speaks Valyrian) My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?"
10341,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,(speaks Valyrian) These men are our guests. (Speaks common.) You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
10342,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
10343,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,"A barrel, then."
10344,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,"Good. The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we'll all share you."
10345,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,I'll come looking for you when this is over.
10346,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,"Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first."
10347,barristan selmy,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai,"Gladly, Your Grace."
10348,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM","Half Robert, half lowborn."
10349,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM",Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon.
10350,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM",What do you mean to do with him?
10351,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM",You know what I mean to do with him.
10352,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM","Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?  If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy."
10353,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM","Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?"
10354,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM",No.
10355,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM","If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor."
10356,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM",You've slaughtered many lambs?
10357,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM",And none have seen the blade.
10358,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON","'And tho- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod- rode Vhagar- Vhag-' Fuck me. 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog- enough- enough to swallow a horse whole."
10359,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",Your Grace.
10360,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",They feeding you enough?
10361,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON","Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain."
10362,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",You don't belong in a place like this.
10363,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON","Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse."
10364,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",Yeah.
10365,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
10366,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",(nods)
10367,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",Melisandre's returned.
10368,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",I didn't know she'd been gone.
10369,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
10370,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",Why?
10371,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",She says there's power in king's blood.
10372,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",She's going to kill him.
10373,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",Sacrifice him.
10374,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON","Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew."
10375,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
10376,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",Because he has your blood in his veins.
10377,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",So did Renly.
10378,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON","Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent."
10379,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON","How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no?  Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?"
10380,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON","Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?"
10381,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
10382,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
10383,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON",You have little regard for your own life.
10384,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON","Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night."
10385,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON","I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
10386,prendahl na ghezn,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI,Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.
10387,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI,You talk too much.
10388,mero,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI,She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
10389,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI,Eight thousand Unsullied stand between her and your cock.
10390,mero,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI,My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
10391,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI,She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
10392,mero,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI,"Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores."

If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"

10446,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS","It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it."

10457,gendry,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS",I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
10458,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS","Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world.

10545,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,You were sent here to kill me?
10546,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,(nods and chuckles)
10547,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,So why haven't you?
10548,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,I don't want to.
10549,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,What do your captains have to say about that?
10550,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,You should ask them.
10551,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,Why?
10552,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,We had philosophical differences.
10553,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,Over what?
10554,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
10555,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,You're a strange man.
10556,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
10557,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,And this is supposed to impress me?
10558,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,Yes.

10560,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
10561,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,Will you fight for me?
10562,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT,(nods)

10701,jon snow,3,29,the rains of castamere,SHOWING ORELL’S EAGLE CIRCLING OVER AN OLD HORSE BREEDER’S HOME,He breeds them for the Watch.
10702,ygritte,3,29,the rains of castamere,SHOWING ORELL’S EAGLE CIRCLING OVER AN OLD HORSE BREEDER’S HOME,How’s he keep folks from stealing them?
10703,jon snow,3,29,the rains of castamere,SHOWING ORELL’S EAGLE CIRCLING OVER AN OLD HORSE BREEDER’S HOME,The Watch protects him.
10704,orell,3,29,the rains of castamere,SHOWING ORELL’S EAGLE CIRCLING OVER AN OLD HORSE BREEDER’S HOME,"Not today they don’t.  He’s selling horses, he’s got some gold in there."
10705,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,SHOWING ORELL’S EAGLE CIRCLING OVER AN OLD HORSE BREEDER’S HOME,And proper steel.

10709,ygritte,3,29,the rains of castamere,SHOWING ORELL’S EAGLE CIRCLING OVER AN OLD HORSE BREEDER’S HOME,He’s an old man.  A spear through the heart’s a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
10710,jon snow,3,29,the rains of castamere,SHOWING ORELL’S EAGLE CIRCLING OVER AN OLD HORSE BREEDER’S HOME,The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.  They’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
10711,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,SHOWING ORELL’S EAGLE CIRCLING OVER AN OLD HORSE BREEDER’S HOME,"I hope so.  Killing crows in their castle is tough.  Killing them out here in the open, that’s what we do."

10721,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO ARYA LOOKING AT THE TWINS,"Of course you are.  You’re almost there and you’re afraid you won’t make it.  The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.  No point in trying to hide behind that face.  I know fear when I see it.  Seen it a lot."
10722,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO ARYA LOOKING AT THE TWINS,I knew fear when I saw it in you.  You’re afraid of fire.

10726,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO ARYA LOOKING AT THE TWINS,Might do.
10727,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO ARYA LOOKING AT THE TWINS,Go ahead then.  You might get away.  Might even make it there on your own.  They’re just over the river.  The closest you’ve been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy’s neck.
10728,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO ARYA LOOKING AT THE TWINS,Someday I’m gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.

10731,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,BACK TO BRAN AND COMPANY INSIDE OF THE WINDMILL,Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.

10771,orell,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WILDLINGS WHO ARE OUTSIDE OF THE WINDMILL WITH THE OLD MAN,I know the difference between shouting and thunder.
10772,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WILDLINGS WHO ARE OUTSIDE OF THE WINDMILL WITH THE OLD MAN,Maybe it's ghosts.

10870,walder frey,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WEDDING CELEBRATION INSIDE OF THE TWINS,"The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.  But they are not yet man and wife.  A sword needs a sheath [Everybody laughs]. And a wedding needs a bedding [Everybody cheers].  What does my sire say?"
10872,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WEDDING CELEBRATION INSIDE OF THE TWINS,"[Gets up from his seat and addresses WALDER] If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them."

10877,roose bolton,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WEDDING CELEBRATION INSIDE OF THE TWINS,Every bride suffers the same.  I’m sure you endured yours with grace.
10878,catelyn stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WEDDING CELEBRATION INSIDE OF THE TWINS,"Oh, Ned forbade it.  He said it wouldn’t be right if he broke a man’s jaw on our wedding night."
10879,talisa stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WEDDING CELEBRATION INSIDE OF THE TWINS,That is a very strange custom.
10880,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WEDDING CELEBRATION INSIDE OF THE TWINS,I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner’s perspective.
10881,talisa stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WEDDING CELEBRATION INSIDE OF THE TWINS,It seems normal to you?
10882,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WEDDING CELEBRATION INSIDE OF THE TWINS,"It’s tradition. [TALISA stares at ROBB]  Without the bedding ceremony, there’s no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage."
10883,talisa stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WEDDING CELEBRATION INSIDE OF THE TWINS,"No, but there are other ways of providing proof."
10884,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WEDDING CELEBRATION INSIDE OF THE TWINS,Boy or girl?
10885,talisa stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WEDDING CELEBRATION INSIDE OF THE TWINS,"I don’t know.  But if it’s a boy, I know what we should name him."
10886,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WEDDING CELEBRATION INSIDE OF THE TWINS,"Oh, do you?   It seems to me the father should have some say in his son’s naming."
10887,talisa stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WEDDING CELEBRATION INSIDE OF THE TWINS,Eddard. [Catches ROBB by surprise] Don’t you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
10888,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,TO THE WEDDING CELEBRATION INSIDE OF THE TWINS,I do.

10923,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",What are you doing?
10924,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",I have a list.
10925,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",A list of people you mean to kill?
10926,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4","For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-"
10927,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",You should learn to ignore them.
10928,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4","My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp."
10929,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
10930,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.
10931,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",(laughs)
10932,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",So how should we punish them?
10933,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",Who? Whom?
10934,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
10935,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
10936,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",I hear that you're a pervert.
10937,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
10938,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4","(chuckles) We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from."
10939,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",Lady Sansa!
10940,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.
10941,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",Why sheep shift?
10942,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",That's the vulgar word for dung.
10943,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4",My lady-
10944,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4","Well, you asked me."
10946,podrick payne,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_4","My lord, my lady. Your father has called a meeting of the small council."

10948,joffrey baratheon,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"Show him. Come on, show him."
10949,pycelle,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"Oh, apologies, my lord. Old fingers."
10950,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,'Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
10951,joffrey baratheon,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,Robb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother. (to Pycelle) Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
10952,varys,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage."
10953,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
10954,joffrey baratheon,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast."
10955,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,No. She is no longer yours to torment.
10956,joffrey baratheon,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster."
10957,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
10958,joffrey baratheon,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,I could have your tongue out for saying that.
10959,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
10960,pycelle,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste."
10961,joffrey baratheon,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,I am the king! I will punish you.
10962,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you."
10963,joffrey baratheon,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
10964,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,The king is tired. See him to his chambers.
10965,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,Come along.
10966,joffrey baratheon,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,I'm not tired.
10967,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.
10968,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep."
10969,joffrey baratheon,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,I'm not tired!
10970,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,Come.
10971,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,Not you.
10972,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
10973,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
10974,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
10975,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,You really think a crown gives you power?
10976,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,No. I think armies give you power.
10977,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,Mm-hmm.
10978,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same."
10979,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,Mm-hmm.
10980,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances."
10981,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
10982,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,I'm all for cheating. This is war.
10983,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
10984,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,So that's why you did it? To save lives?
10985,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
10986,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,The Northerners will never forget.
10987,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
10988,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
10989,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
10990,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
10991,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,I will not rape her.
10992,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
10993,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
10994,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
10995,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,(smirks)
10996,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,Does that amuse you?
10997,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
10998,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"Easy for me, is it?"
10999,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
11000,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS,"The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister."
11001,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_4,Sansa.

11004,hodor,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER",Hodor. Hodor.
11005,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER","Don't, Hodor."
11006,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER",Maybe we shouldn't stay.
11007,meera reed,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER",You'd rather be out there?
11008,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER",There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
11009,jojen reed,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER",I always quite liked the horrible stories.
11010,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER",So did I. Once.
11011,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER",You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
11012,meera reed,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER",No. Who's he?
11013,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER","Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry."
11014,meera reed,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER",If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-
11015,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER",It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.
11016,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL","'The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I'm Lord of Riverrun. (laughs)"
11017,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL",The Blackfish escaped.
11018,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL",An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
11019,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL",As you say.
11020,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL","They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?"
11021,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL",You'll be needing a new young girl.
11022,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL",Yeah. Got that to look forward to.
11023,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL",(grunts)
11024,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL","And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country."
11025,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL",He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant-
11026,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL",Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
11027,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL",(nods)
11028,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL","Well, here's to the Young Wolf! (howls)"

11030,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL",Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
11031,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL",At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
11032,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL","Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing."
11033,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL",I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.  Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon.
11034,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL",Oh. And?
11035,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL",Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
11036,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_2","Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock."
11037,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_2",What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
11038,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_2",People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
11039,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_2","Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?"
11040,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_2",Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.

11088,jojen reed,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT",The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.

11140,davos seaworth,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.

11147,varys,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_5",You were only a child.
11148,shae,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_5",I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.
11149,varys,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_5","You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking."
11150,shae,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_5",And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
11151,varys,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_5",She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.

11155,varys,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_5","We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-"
11156,shae,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_5",I have a name.
11157,varys,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_5",You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.

11159,varys,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_5","Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up."
11160,shae,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_5",Why do you want me to leave?
11161,varys,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_5","Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place.

I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time."

11175,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING",I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
11176,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING",You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
11177,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING",So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
11178,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING",So she can have some happiness in her life.
11179,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING",You have children. How happy would you say you are?
11180,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING","Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive."
11181,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING",Even Joffrey?
11182,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING","Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own."

11242,shireen baratheon,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_5,My books are better than these boring scrolls. You could read about Balerion the Dread. They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. I'd like to see that someday.

11631,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters,(Chuckles)
11632,sam,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters,They're... they're ready for you.
11633,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters,He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.
11634,sam,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters,No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.
11635,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters,I've done plenty wrong.
11637,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,I didn't murder him.
11639,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,He wanted me to kill him.
11640,janos slynt,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?
11641,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
11643,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,"Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."
11644,janos slynt,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.
11645,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,"Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl."
11646,janos slynt,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,"You admit to breaking your vows, then?"
11647,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,I do.
11648,janos slynt,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,The law is the law. The boy must die.
11649,aemon,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,"If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men."
11651,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,"While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000."
11653,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,"100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him."
11654,janos slynt,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,(Laughs) Giants?
11655,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,"Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?"
11656,janos slynt,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,"I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy."
11657,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.
11658,janos slynt,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,How dare you?!
11659,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
11660,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?
11661,aemon,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,"None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on."
11663,aemon,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,"Yes, you are."
11665,aemon,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,He told the truth.
11667,aemon,4,31,two swords,Winterfell.,I grew up in King's Landing.
11668,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,King's Landing garden.,"No. No. You're a queen, not an ox."
11669,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,King's Landing garden.,Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.
11670,margaery tyrell,4,31,two swords,King's Landing garden.,"The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything."
11671,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,King's Landing garden.,Nonsense.
11672,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,King's Landing garden.,"My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best."
11673,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,King's Landing garden.,"The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that."
11674,margaery tyrell,4,31,two swords,King's Landing garden.,Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.
11675,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,King's Landing garden.,"You watch that. Even here, even with me."
11676,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,King's Landing garden.,My word.
11677,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,King's Landing garden.,My lady. My lady. Please pardon me for interrupting. My name is Brienne of Tarth.
11678,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,King's Landing garden.,We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.
11679,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,King's Landing garden.,I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.
11680,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,King's Landing garden.,"My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment."
11681,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,King's Landing garden.,You dare not refuse.
11682,margaery tyrell,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden.,A shadow?
11683,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden.,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king."
11684,margaery tyrell,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden.,Joffrey is our king now.
11685,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden.,I meant no offense.
11686,margaery tyrell,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden.,And you've given none.

11692,meryn trant,4,31,two swords,King's Landing._2,The people love their king. They know who keeps them fed.
11693,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,King's Landing._2,"Margaery Tyrell, I've heard."
11694,joffrey baratheon,4,31,two swords,King's Landing._2,By my leave. They know I saved the city. They know I won the war.
11695,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,King's Landing._2,The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.
11696,joffrey baratheon,4,31,two swords,King's Landing._2,"I broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle."
11697,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,King's Landing._2,"My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy."

11701,joffrey baratheon,4,31,two swords,King's Landing._2,Ser Jaime Lannister. (Chuckles)
11702,joffrey baratheon,4,31,two swords,King's Landing._2,Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.
11703,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,King's Landing._2,There's still time.
11704,joffrey baratheon,4,31,two swords,King's Landing._2,Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that?
11705,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,King's Landing._2,"I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest."
11706,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,Have you ever been to Meereen?
11707,missandei,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,"Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys."
11708,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,And?
11709,missandei,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,"They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen."
11710,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?
11711,missandei,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,"If they're smart, Your Grace."
11712,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,You were told to ride at the back of the train.
11713,daario naharis,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,"Yes, my queen. But I need to speak to you about something important. A matter of strategy."
11714,missandei,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,Your Grace.
11715,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,"All right, what is this matter of strategy?"
11716,daario naharis,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,A dusk rose.
11717,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?
11718,daario naharis,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,And this one's called lady's lace.
11719,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,Would you like to walk without shoes?
11720,daario naharis,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,"You have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy."
11721,daario naharis,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,Harpy's Gold. No tea from this one. Beautiful but poisonous.
11722,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,"You are a gambler, aren't you?"
11723,daario naharis,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,Your Grace.
11724,jorah mormont,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.
11725,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,How many miles are there between here and Meereen?
11726,barristan selmy,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,"163, Your Grace. I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this."
11727,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,ESSOS_4,You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.
11728,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,There she is.
11729,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,"Yes, there she is."
11730,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,And? You made a promise.
11731,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.
11732,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,To keep them safe.
11733,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,"Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication."
11734,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,A complication does not release you from a vow.
11735,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?
11736,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.
11737,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,"Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks."
11738,dontos hollard,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
11739,sansa stark,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,You're drunk.
11740,dontos hollard,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,Yes. I have good reason to be. Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool. Don't you know me?
11741,sansa stark,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.
11742,dontos hollard,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,"I can't accept your apology. I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you."
11743,sansa stark,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,Anyone would have done the same.
11744,dontos hollard,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,"But only you did. I can never repay you. You gave me my life. But this, this is worth more than my life."
11745,dontos hollard,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,"It belonged to my mother and her mother before her. House Hollard was strong once. House on the rise. That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me."
11746,sansa stark,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,"I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't."
11747,dontos hollard,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,I don't have anything else left. That's all. Take it. Wear it. Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.
11748,sansa stark,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,"I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos."
11749,dontos hollard,4,31,two swords,KING'S LANDING.,Yeah.

11760,arya stark,4,31,two swords,THE RIVERLANDS_5,You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.
11761,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,THE RIVERLANDS_5,"You've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much."

11789,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,Pour our new friend some ale. What brings you so far north?
11790,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?
11791,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,Just keeping the king's peace.
11792,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,No need. The war's over.
11793,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.
11794,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,None taken.
11795,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,"He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And what's life without a little fun? (Chuckles)"
11796,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,"But I don't need to tell you that, eh?"
11797,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,She's all right. I've had better.
11798,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,"(Laughs) You know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. Always something if you know how to make them talk. And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been."
11799,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,I'm not going to King's Landing.
11800,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,Think about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go. These are the king's colors. No one's standing in his way now. Which means no one's standing in ours.
11801,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,Fuck the king.

11804,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,You got money to pay for it?
11805,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,You paid for it?
11806,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,"(Laughs) No. But we're the king's men. So, you got money?"
11807,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,Not a penny.
11808,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,I'll still take that chicken.
11809,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.
11810,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.
11811,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,Ah. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.
11812,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,You don't seem to understand the situation.
11813,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,"I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room."
11814,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,You lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens?
11815,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR,Someone is.

11894,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,What did you do to him?
11895,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned."
11896,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,You flayed him.
11897,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.
11898,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.
11899,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,We've been flaying our enemies for a thousand years. The flayed man is on our banners.
11900,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the Ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin."
11901,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no-
11902,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
11903,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.
11904,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.
11905,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us."
11906,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,I placed far too much trust in you.
11907,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful."
11908,theon greyjoy,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"I'm sorry, my lord."
11909,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,Give him the razor.
11910,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?"
11911,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"Go on, Reek. A nice close shave."
11912,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?"
11913,theon greyjoy,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"I don't know, my lord."
11914,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.
11915,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?"
11916,theon greyjoy,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"No, my lord. Just two farm boys."
11917,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,And crisped them so no one would know.
11918,theon greyjoy,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"Yes, my lord."
11919,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone."
11920,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?"
11921,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,You ready for a hunt?
11922,meryn trant,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,Always. Find those boys and I'll give you a thousand acres and a holdfast.
11923,locke,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?
11924,theon greyjoy,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
11925,locke,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
11926,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.
11927,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat."
11928,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR,"You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position."

11935,varys,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY","No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear."
11936,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY",Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
11937,varys,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY",No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.
11938,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY","She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it."
11939,varys,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING GARDEN, DAY",Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?

12006,selyse baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM,"Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?"
12007,melisandre,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM,It's all I knew when I was a child.
12008,selyse baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM,Until you found the Lord of Light?
12009,melisandre,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM,Until he found me.
12010,selyse baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM,I fear for our daughter's soul.
12011,melisandre,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM,Every mother should fear for her child's soul.
12012,selyse baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM,She's a stubborn little beast.
12013,stannis baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM,She's a child.
12014,selyse baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM,You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.
12015,stannis baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM,She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
12016,selyse baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,STORM'S END DINING ROOM,As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.
12017,shireen baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,Come in.
12018,melisandre,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,"Were you sleeping, Princess?"
12019,shireen baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,(shakes her head)
12020,melisandre,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
12021,shireen baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,I heard it.
12022,melisandre,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,And it frightened you?
12023,shireen baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,Ser Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.
12024,melisandre,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,"They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world."
12025,shireen baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,But they screamed.
12026,melisandre,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.
12027,shireen baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,Afterward they aren't ash and bone.
12028,melisandre,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,"You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess."
12029,shireen baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,And you didn't have this.
12030,melisandre,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,"No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?"
12031,shireen baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,"I read ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""
12032,melisandre,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,"Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war."
12033,shireen baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?
12034,melisandre,4,32,the lion and the rose,SHIREEN'S BEDROOM,"There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now."

12037,meera reed,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT",You've been gone for hours.
12038,bran stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT",I was hungry.
12039,meera reed,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT",We're all hungry.
12040,bran stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT",I was just eating.
12041,jojen reed,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT","Summer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran."
12042,jojen reed,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT","Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human."
12043,meera reed,4,32,the lion and the rose,"THE NORTH, NIGHT","You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything."
12044,bran stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE NORTH_7,"Hodor, take me to the tree."
12045,three-eyed raven,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE NORTH_7,Look for me... beneath the tree.
12046,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE NORTH_7,He saw us.
12047,three-eyed raven,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE NORTH_7,North.
12048,bran stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE NORTH_7,I know where we have to go.

12052,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_2",Better her than you.
12053,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN,"Bit much, wouldn't you say?"
12054,olenna tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN,It feels proportionate.
12055,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN,Proportionate to what?
12056,olenna tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN,The expected extravagance.
12057,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN,People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
12058,olenna tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN,You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.
12059,olenna tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN,"Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking."
12060,olenna tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN,"Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share."
12061,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN,Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
12062,olenna tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN,"No, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. ""The Iron Bank will have it's due."" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts."
12063,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN,I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.
12064,olenna tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,KING'S LANDING GARDEN,"We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love."

12068,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,You saw the ship sail away?

12071,bronn,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,"Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow."
12072,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,There's someone following you?
12073,bronn,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,"She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing."
12074,oberyn martell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,Hello.
12075,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,Hello.
12076,oberyn martell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,Not you.
12077,olenna tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage."
12078,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,My lady. My lady.
12079,olenna tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for."
12081,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,Very good. Very good. Off you go.
12082,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,Everyone. The queen would like to say a few words.
12083,margaery tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city."
12084,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,You're an example to us all.
12085,loras tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry."
12086,jaime lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful."
12087,loras tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,As does yours.
12088,jaime lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"So, looking forward to your wedding?"
12089,loras tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"Yes, very much."
12090,jaime lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
12091,loras tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,They certainly are.
12092,jaime lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her."
12093,loras tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,And neither will you.
12094,brienne of tarth,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,Your Grace. My king. My queen.
12095,margaery tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,Lady Brienne. So good of you to come.
12096,brienne of tarth,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"I'm no lady, Your Grace."
12097,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,Did you just bow?
12098,brienne of tarth,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy."
12099,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.
12100,margaery tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it."
12101,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,A shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.
12102,brienne of tarth,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.
12103,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"Yes, yes."
12104,margaery tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,Thank you. I hope we see more of you.
12105,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
12106,brienne of tarth,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"As you say, Your Grace."
12107,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.
12108,brienne of tarth,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once."
12109,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,Did he? Haven't heard that story before.
12110,brienne of tarth,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid."
12111,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
12112,brienne of tarth,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,"I don't serve your brother, Your Grace."
12113,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,But you love him.
12114,brienne of tarth,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE,Your Grace.
12115,pycelle,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,"No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally."
12116,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,She'll do no such thing.
12117,pycelle,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,"Oh, Your Grace. Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice..."
12118,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.
12120,pycelle,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.
12121,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?
12122,pycelle,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,"Your Grace, I am a man of learning."
12123,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
12124,pycelle,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,I never meant to annoy anyone.
12125,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
12126,pycelle,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,"Your Grace, Queen Margaery-"
12127,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.
12128,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.
12129,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,You're in rather a good mood.
12130,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,I suppose I am.
12131,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,I won't ask why.
12132,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Small pleasures.
12133,oberyn martell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Your Grace. Lord Tywin.
12134,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Prince Oberyn.
12135,oberyn martell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand."
12136,ellaria sand,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,My lord. My lady.
12137,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Charmed.
12138,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.
12139,ellaria sand,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters."
12140,oberyn martell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne."
12141,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,No? How tolerant of you.
12142,oberyn martell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked."
12143,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding."
12144,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again."
12145,oberyn martell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.
12146,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
12147,oberyn martell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"People everywhere have their differences. In some places, the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place."
12148,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Everyone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords... my ladies..."
12149,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"I give you. King Joffrey... Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings."
12150,renly baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,I'm the rightful king.
12151,robb stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,King in the North!
12152,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Yes!
12153,balon dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Traitor. You're a traitor.
12154,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,For the Seven Kingdoms!
12155,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Let the war begin.
12156,stannis dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Renly, you're no king."
12157,balon dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Away, degenerate. Away. Away."
12158,renly baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Ooh, careful."
12159,stannis dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Go on.
12160,renly baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,I want you to be my prince. Stannis!
12161,balon dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Who's got the gold now, Stark?"
12162,robb stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,I am the rightful king.
12163,balon dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Challenge me, ruffian."
12164,robb stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Take that.
12165,balon dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,I'm drowning. I'm drowning.
12166,robb stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,I am the King in the North!
12167,stannis dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Not wildfire!
12168,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.
12169,podrick payne,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Yes, my lord."
12170,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,We'll have to find another way to thank the king.
12171,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Charge!
12172,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Ready, again."
12173,robb stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,I am the King in the North! - Charge!
12174,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Charge! Yes!
12175,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Your head!
12176,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Fine gentlemen.
12177,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle. How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume."
12178,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night."
12179,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.
12180,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,It did not spill.
12181,margaery tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast."
12182,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cup-bearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight."
12183,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Your Grace does me a great honor.
12184,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,(miffed) It's not meant as an honor.
12185,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Bring me my goblet.
12186,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,What good is an empty cup? Fill it.
12187,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Kneel. Kneel before your king.
12188,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Kneel. I said... kneel!
12189,margaery tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"(Standing) Look, the pie."
12190,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,My queen.
12191,margaery tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Wonderful. Wonderful. My hero.
12192,sansa stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Can we leave now?
12193,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Let's find out.
12194,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cup-bearer, remember?"
12195,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace."
12196,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are. Serve me my wine."
12197,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Well, hurry up. This pie is dry."
12198,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Mm, good. Needs washing down."
12199,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired."
12200,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"No. (coughing) No, you'll wait here... un..."
12201,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Your Grace?
12202,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,It's nothing.
12203,margaery tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,He's choking!
12204,olenna tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Help the poor boy.
12205,olenna tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Idiots, help your king."
12206,jaime lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Move away!
12207,jaime lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Joffrey! Joffrey!
12208,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Help him! Someone help him!
12209,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,(gags)
12210,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Joffrey!
12211,dontos hollard,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,(to SANSA) Come with me now.
12212,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Joffrey! Joffrey!
12213,dontos hollard,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"If you want to live, we have to leave."
12214,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,Don't touch him!
12215,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!"
12216,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,My son.
12218,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_2,"He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!"
12219,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_19,You did this. You did this!
12220,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_19,We have to leave.
12221,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_19,Take him! Take him!
12222,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_19,Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?
12223,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_19,Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.
12224,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_19,Where is she?!
12225,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_19,No one leaves the capital! No one!
12226,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,KINGS LANDING DOCK AT DUSK,Get in.
12227,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,KINGS LANDING DOCK AT DUSK,Where are we going?
12228,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,KINGS LANDING DOCK AT DUSK,Somewhere safe.
12229,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,MISTY OCEAN AT NIGHT,"Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know."
12230,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER",Lord Baelish?
12231,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER","Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?"
12232,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER",(shakes her head.)
12233,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER",Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past.  Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.
12234,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER",Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.
12235,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER","Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water."
12236,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER","I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.  LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?"
12237,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER","10,000."
12238,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER",Wait!
12239,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER","Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?"
12240,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER",I didn't murder anyone.
12241,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER","I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder."
12242,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER",Why did you kill him?
12243,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER",Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
12244,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER",He saved me.
12245,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER","Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever."
12246,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER",He was helping me because I saved his life.
12247,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER","Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard."
12248,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER",I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?
12249,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER",We're all liars here.
12250,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,"LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER","Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home."
12251,margaery tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY,So am I the queen?
12252,olenna tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY,"More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue."
12253,margaery tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY,"Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible."
12254,olenna tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY,"The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it."
12255,margaery tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY,What was it like?
12256,olenna tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY,They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
12257,margaery tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY,One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
12258,olenna tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY,"Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that."
12259,margaery tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY,But I would have been the queen.
12260,olenna tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY,Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
12261,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
12262,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,I'm not trying to trick you.
12263,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,It means I'll become king.
12264,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,"Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?"
12265,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,A good king?
12266,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,"Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?"
12267,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,This is hardly the place or the time.
12268,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Holiness?
12269,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
12270,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Justice.
12271,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
12272,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,No.
12273,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,No.
12274,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,What about strength?
12275,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,"Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?"
12276,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Wisdom.
12277,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Yes!
12278,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Wisdom is what makes a good king.
12279,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
12280,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,No.
12281,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,"No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?"
12282,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,A king needs a queen.
12283,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,"Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?"
12284,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Yes.
12285,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,"Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?"
12286,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.
12287,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,How are you?
12288,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,I'm all right.
12289,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,You are. You will be. I'll see to that.
12290,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
12291,high septon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,"Yes, my lord. All of you."
12292,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,"It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he..."
12293,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,I don't know what I saw.
12294,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.
12295,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
12296,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,"I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. (CRYING) Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy."
12297,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
12298,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,"Jaime, not here, please. Please."
12299,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Stop it. Stop it. Stop.
12300,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,No.
12301,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Stop it. Stop.
12302,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,Stop.  Stop. It's not right.
12303,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,(GRUNTS)
12304,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,It's not right. It's not right.
12305,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,I don't care.
12306,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,(CRYING)  Don't.
12307,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,I don't care.
12308,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,"Don't. Jaime, don't."
12309,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY,I don't care.
12310,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,Gonna rain soon. Where are we?
12311,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,"Near Fairmarket, I think."
12312,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,You think? You don't have a map?
12313,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,"No, I don't have a map."
12314,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,Maybe we should get one.
12315,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.
12316,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,How far is it to the Eyrie?
12317,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,Far.
12318,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,And you're sure we're going the right way?
12319,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,"Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way."
12320,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,On your way where?
12321,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,"Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me."
12322,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,I'd like to see Braavos one day.
12323,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,Why Braavos?
12324,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,I have friends there.
12325,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,I doubt it.
12326,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,Seven blessings to you.
12327,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,What do you want?
12328,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,What do I want? This is my land.
12329,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,"If I'm standing on it, it's my land."
12330,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
12331,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,(nods)
12332,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,He's never been the same.
12333,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,Which house did he fight for?
12334,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,The Tullys of Riverrun.
12335,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT,"There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it."
12336,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
12337,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,You got to do all seven of the fuckers?
12338,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,Father!
12339,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
12340,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
12341,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,I'm so sorry.
12342,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,Really good.
12343,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,Did you fight at the Twins?
12344,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
12345,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
12346,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,Guest right don't mean much anymore.
12347,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,"It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour."
12348,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,You got any ale?
12349,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,Afraid not.
12350,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,How can a man not keep ale in his home?
12351,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,"You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense."
12352,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?
12353,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME.,(Nods) Fair wages for fair work.
12354,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN,What did you do?!
12355,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN,Get your horse saddled.
12356,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN,You told me you weren't a thief.
12357,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN,I wasn't.
12358,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN,He took us in. He fed us and you...
12359,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN,"Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter."
12360,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN,You don't know that.
12361,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN,I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.
12362,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN,You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
12363,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN,There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
12364,ranger,4,33,breaker of chains,CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD_2,Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.
12366,janos slynt,4,33,breaker of chains,CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD_2,Going to visit your wildling whore?
12367,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD_2,She's not a whore.
12368,janos slynt,4,33,breaker of chains,CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD_2,No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.
12369,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,They all think I'm lying.
12370,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,About what?
12371,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,Killing the white Walker.
12372,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,You're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed.
12373,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...
12374,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,A what?
12375,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,"Well, a wildling."
12376,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,My father hated that word.
12377,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,"It's not a very nice word, I suppose."
12378,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,"I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?"
12379,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,So... are you all right? No one bothering you?
12380,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.
12381,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,I worry about it sometimes. All the time.
12382,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,Why do you worry about it?
12383,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,"100 men, one woman."
12384,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,They've got other things to think about.
12385,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,That's the only thing they think about.
12386,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,You're being silly.
12387,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
12388,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,What about you?
12389,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.
12390,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,Thank you.
12391,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,For what?
12392,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,For worrying about me.
12393,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,"I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep."
12394,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,So what are you saying?
12395,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
12396,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,Are you bored of me?
12397,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.
12398,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK,I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.
12399,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,Your Grace.
12400,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?
12401,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,Joffrey?
12402,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
12403,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,"I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night..."
12404,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,What progress have you made?
12405,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.
12406,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,House Peasebury.
12407,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,House Musgood.
12408,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,House Musgood.
12409,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,And House Haigh.
12410,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
12411,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,"Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company."
12412,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,The Golden Company?
12413,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,They've never broken a contract.
12414,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,They're sellswords.
12415,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,"We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground."
12416,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,We don't have any gold.
12417,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,Not yet.
12418,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT,"If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -"

12425,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,"DRAGONSTONE, SHIREEN's room.",It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words. But I think you can manage.

12429,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,"DRAGONSTONE, SHIREEN's room.",I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates. You were a pirate once.
12430,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,"DRAGONSTONE, SHIREEN's room.","No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler."
12431,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,"DRAGONSTONE, SHIREEN's room.",What's the difference?
12432,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,"DRAGONSTONE, SHIREEN's room.","Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right."
12433,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,"DRAGONSTONE, SHIREEN's room.",My father says a criminal is a criminal.
12434,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,"DRAGONSTONE, SHIREEN's room.",Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.

12436,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,"DRAGONSTONE, SHIREEN's room.","Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father.

12437,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,"DRAGONSTONE, SHIREEN's room.",What was that for?
12438,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,"DRAGONSTONE, SHIREEN's room.",I need you to write a message.
12439,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,"DRAGONSTONE, SHIREEN's room.",You should write it yourself. It's good practice.

12457,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN INN,That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
12458,mole's town madam,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN INN,"Could find other work for her, too."

12472,ellaria sand,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,"That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you."
12473,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Your loss.
12474,olyvar,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,You like them both the same? Boys and girls?
12475,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Does that surprise you?
12476,olyvar,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Everyone has a preference.
12477,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,"Then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides."
12478,olyvar,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.

Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day."
12482,olyvar,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Did you?
12483,ellaria sand,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
12484,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,They will all have to line up behind you.
12485,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Prince Oberyn.
12486,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Lord Tywin.

12488,ellaria sand,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,"Call my name if you need me, lover."
12489,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Would you like to sit?
12490,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,"No, thank you."
12491,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Some wine?
12492,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,"No, thank you."
12493,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,I'm sorry about your grandson.
12494,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Are you?
12495,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.
12496,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Which way is that?
12497,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,"Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?"
12498,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Some believe the king choked.
12499,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.
12500,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
12501,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,I did. This is why I know.
12502,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,"Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning."
12503,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
12504,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
12505,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,You think we conspired together?
12506,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,What did you discuss?
12507,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,The death of my sister.
12508,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,For which you blame me.
12509,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.
12510,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,"Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?"
12511,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,"You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow."
12512,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
12513,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
12514,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Categorically.
12515,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,I would like to speak with the Mountain.
12516,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
12517,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
12518,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,I could arrange for this meeting.
12519,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,But you want something in return.
12520,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,"There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third."
12521,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,Why?
12522,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,"Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies."
12523,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,"Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting."
12524,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
12525,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,"I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin."
12526,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,"We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons."
12527,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.
12528,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING_20,We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
12529,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Podrick. Apologies for the stench.
12530,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me."
12531,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,A noble effort.
12532,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese."
12533,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
12534,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"I've heard nothing, my lord."
12535,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
12536,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
12537,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
12538,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"No, my lord. You didn't?"
12539,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?"
12540,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Your father.
12541,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Of course.
12542,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Mace Tyrell.
12543,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
12544,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
12545,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
12546,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf."
12547,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa."
12548,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"My lord, she's gone."
12549,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Gone?
12550,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...
12551,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick."
12552,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"Yes, my lord?"
12553,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,They'll be following you now.
12554,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Who will?
12555,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
12556,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"Any other witnesses, my lord?"
12557,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
12558,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,He's already been called as a witness for the queen.
12559,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
12560,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you."
12561,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Why not?
12562,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
12563,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
12564,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"I'll ask, my lord."
12565,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler."
12566,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
12567,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"I didn't tell them anything, my lord."
12568,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Are you going to accept their offer?
12569,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,My lord.
12570,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."
12571,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"You've been good to me, my lord."
12572,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that."
12573,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"I already gave them an answer, my lord."
12574,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted."
12575,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,My lord.
12576,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell."
12577,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,"Farewell, my lord."
12578,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL,Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.
12579,olly,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_8,Mother says it's time to eat.
12580,guymon,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_8,What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.
12581,olly,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_8,Potatoes.
12582,guymon,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_8,"Potatoes. Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom. Has she got..."
12584,olly's mother,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_8,Guymon! (to OLLY) Hide. Hide!
12585,styr,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_8,You know how to get to Castle Black?
12586,olly,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_8,Yes. Yes.
12587,styr,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_8,Those your parents? Open your eyes. I'm going to eat them. Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa. Go tell the crows at Castle Black.
12588,denys mallister,4,33,breaker of chains,CASTLE BLACK MAIN HALL,We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.
12590,denys mallister,4,33,breaker of chains,CASTLE BLACK MAIN HALL,Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall. Seems like that would be a good lesson.
12593,aemon,4,33,breaker of chains,CASTLE BLACK MAIN HALL,We have just over 100 men. And that's including stewards and builders. And me. We can't afford to lose a single man. We must remember our first responsibility. We are the watchers on the Wall.
12594,pypar,4,33,breaker of chains,CASTLE BLACK MAIN HALL,There's got to be a way to protect them.
12596,jon snow,4,33,breaker of chains,CASTLE BLACK MAIN HALL,"Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them."
12598,pypar,4,33,breaker of chains,CASTLE BLACK MAIN HALL,Rangers returning.
12599,jon snow,4,33,breaker of chains,THE GATE TO THE WALL,Help him.
12600,dolorous edd,4,33,breaker of chains,THE GATE TO THE WALL,Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.
12601,alliser thorne,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard.,What took you so long?
12602,grenn,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard.,We were held up.
12603,alliser thorne,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard.,By what?
12604,grenn,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard.,Chains.
12605,dolorous edd,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard.,We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.
12606,jon snow,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard.,And the mutineers stayed?
12607,dolorous edd,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard.,They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
12608,jon snow,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard.,We need to ride north and kill them all.
12609,alliser thorne,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard.,"We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait."
12610,jon snow,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard.,"It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them."
12611,pypar,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard.,I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
12612,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,Are they attacking?
12613,jorah mormont,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.
12614,champion,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,(SPEAKING VALYRIAN)
12615,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,What is he doing?
12616,barristan selmy,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,I believe he means to...
12617,missandei,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,"He says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole."
12618,barristan selmy,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,"Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words."
12619,jorah mormont,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
12620,champion,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,(CONTINUES SPEAKING VALYRIAN)
12621,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,"I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?"
12622,grey worm,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,"(SPEAKING VALYRIAN) Allow me this honor, mother of dragons. I will not disappoint you."
12623,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,(valyrian) You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.
12624,barristan selmy,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,"Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive."
12625,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,Which is why you must remain by my side.
12626,jorah mormont,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,"I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well."
12627,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,"You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life."
12628,daario naharis,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,"I was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you."
12629,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.
12630,missandei,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,"He is very brave, Your Grace."
12631,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,"Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching."
12632,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,You sure you don't want a horse?
12633,daario naharis,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,Why would I want a horse?
12634,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,Horses are faster than men.
12635,daario naharis,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,Horses are dumber than men.
12636,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,(valyrian) I am Daenerys Stormborn.
12637,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,"(valyrian) Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you."
12638,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!
12639,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_5,Fire!
12640,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,"My name is Grey Worm. I come from the Summer ""Ills."""
12641,missandei,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,Isles. Summer Isles.

12643,missandei,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,(speaks Valyrian) I am from an island called Naath.
12644,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,(speaks Valyrian) When they took you?
12645,missandei,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,"""When did they take me?"" I was five years old."
12646,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,You remember your home?
12647,missandei,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,I remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home?
12648,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,"(Shakes his head.) Unsullied. Always Unsullied. Before Unsullied, nothing."
12649,missandei,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,That's not true. Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
12650,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,I don't want return. (Speaks Valyrian.)
12651,missandei,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,Kill the masters.
12652,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,Kill the masters.
12653,daenerys targaryen,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,How are the lessons coming?
12654,missandei,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,"Very well, Your Grace."
12655,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,"Missandei is teacher good, my queen."
12656,daenerys targaryen,4,34,oathkeeper,MEEREEN AT NIGHT,You'll have to continue later. It's time.
12657,mossador,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters.,(speaking Valyrian.) You heard her! She said she came to free us.
12658,elder meereen slave,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters.,(speaking Valyrian.)  You are a fool. The masters are too strong.
12659,mossador,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters.,(speaking Valyrian.) She will protect us. She defeated the masters' champion.
12660,mossador,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters.,(speaking Valyrian.) She has a great army. You want to live the rest of your days in chains?
12662,elder meereen slave,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters.,"(speaking Valyrian.) I've been through two slave revolts, boy. They always end the same way"
12663,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters.,(speaking Valyrian.)  All men must die.
12664,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters.,"(speaking Valyrian.) But I promise you, a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains."
12665,elder meereen slave,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters.,(speaking Valyrian.) Who are you?
12666,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters.,"(speaking Valyrian.) This one is called Grey Worm. I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied. Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains."
12667,elder meereen slave,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters.,(speaking Valyrian.) You are Unsullied? They taught you how to fight before you could walk. We are not soldiers.
12669,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters.,"(speaking Valyrian.) There are three slaves in this city for every Master. No one can give you your freedom, brothers. If you want it, you must take it."

12676,daenerys targaryen,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen streets at day,"Yes, that was it."
12678,barristan selmy,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen streets at day,"Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people,they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy."
12679,daenerys targaryen,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen streets at day,I will answer injustice with justice.
12680,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing._3,What the hell was that?
12681,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing._3,That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
12682,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing._3,"You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway."
12683,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing._3,You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
12684,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing._3,You talk to my brother this way?
12685,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing._3,All the time. He got used to it.
12686,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing._3,Do you think he did it?
12687,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing._3,"No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?"
12688,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing._3,"You haven't been to see him yet, eh?"
12689,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing._3,We're done for today.
12690,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing._3,Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
12691,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing._3,You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
12692,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing._3,Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?
12693,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,"To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months."
12694,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,Is that supposed to make me feel better?
12695,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
12696,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,"It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?"
12697,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
12698,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,Her son?
12699,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,Don't. You know what's coming?
12700,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,"My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed."
12701,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,"Now that you mention it, she did ask."
12702,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,"So, should I turn around and close my eyes?"
12703,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,Depends. Did you do it?
12704,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
12705,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
12706,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,"Well, you could set me free."
12707,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,You know I can't.
12708,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,Then there's really nothing else to say.
12709,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
12710,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,"Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate."
12711,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
12712,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,Except I didn't do it.
12713,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,"Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my head's on a spike."
12714,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
12715,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
12716,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,Tyrion's cell,"No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway."
12717,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,Where are you taking me?
12718,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
12719,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,Did you kill Joffrey?
12720,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
12721,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,I know it was you.
12722,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,And who helped me with this conspiracy?
12723,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,"Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king."
12724,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,Why not?
12725,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
12726,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,Then perhaps it was your husband.
12727,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,No.
12728,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,How do you know?
12729,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,I just do.
12730,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
12731,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,"The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal."
12732,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,"A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."
12733,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,"I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?"
12734,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
12735,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,And what do you want?
12736,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,"Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?"
12737,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,Who could trust you?
12738,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,Littlefinger's ship.,"I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong."
12739,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.
12740,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,"The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs."
12741,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,(laughs)
12742,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,Have you been to see Tommen yet?
12743,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
12744,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,"I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."
12745,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,(laughs)
12746,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,How absentminded of me.
12747,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,Mm-hmm.
12748,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,"The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk."
12749,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,(laughs)
12750,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,"And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."
12751,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,"Well, he could have done."
12752,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,"He could have done,but he didn't."
12753,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,"You don't know, Grandmother."
12754,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,"But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?"
12755,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,What? I don't understand.
12756,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing garden,Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
12757,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,Bring it through! And again.
12758,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,Very nice. Good.
12759,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
12760,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,Let's see what you can do.
12761,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,"Olly, you just watch for now."
12762,olly,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,I can fight.
12763,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.
12764,olly,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,I was!
12765,grenn,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,"I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn."
12766,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,"You two. Take it slow,  try and disarm each other."
12767,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
12768,locke,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,He wouldn't have learned anything that way.
12770,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,Grenn and I were helping them.
12771,alliser thorne,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,"Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't."
12772,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,Someone has to train them.
12775,janos slynt,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,The bastard's well-liked.You're not.
12777,janos slynt,4,34,oathkeeper,Castle Black courtyard,For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
12778,locke,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory,"A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn."
12779,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory,My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
12780,locke,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory,Name's Locke.
12781,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory,Jon Snow.
12782,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory,You fight well.
12783,locke,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory,What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
12785,locke,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory,Guess I was wrong.
12786,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.","You sent for me, Your Grace?"
12787,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.",Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
12788,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.",Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
12789,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.",So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
12790,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.",I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
12791,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.",The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
12792,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.",What?
12793,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.",I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
12794,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.",You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
12795,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.",She hoped or did you promise?
12796,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.","I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her."
12797,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.",So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
12798,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.",I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?
12799,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.","You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?"
12800,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.","Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?"
12801,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.",I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
12802,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.",I had to see him. I had to know for myself.
12803,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.",And?
12804,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.","He didn't do it, Cersei."
12805,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,"King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.","You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander."
12806,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,Ser Pounce?
12807,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,How did you get past the Kingsguard?
12808,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,Kingsguard.
12809,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,I don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
12810,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,"I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride."
12811,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,"Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?"
12812,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,Yes. But if my mother found out...
12813,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,"It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace..."
12814,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,Yes? Tell me a secret.
12815,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
12816,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,That's Ser Pounce.
12817,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,Very handsome.
12818,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
12819,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.
12820,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,No. I don't think I am.
12821,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?
12822,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,"We say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast."
12823,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,Tommen's bedroom.,"When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then."

12829,brienne of tarth,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing,I can't accept this.
12830,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing,"It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you."
12831,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing,I hope I got your measurements right.
12832,brienne of tarth,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing,I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.
12833,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,King's Landing,I almost forgot. I have one more gift.
12834,brienne of tarth,4,34,oathkeeper,The forrest outside King's Landing,I don't need a squire.
12835,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The forrest outside King's Landing,Of course you do.

I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?"

13052,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
13053,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",A fortnight?
13054,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",That seems reasonable.
13055,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY","No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals."
13056,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",(shakes her head)

13058,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",Shortly after Tommen's.
13059,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",Shortly?
13060,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",A fortnight.
13061,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
13062,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",We had that in common.
13063,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
13064,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",Then whom can we trust?
13065,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",Ourselves alone.
13066,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
13067,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",Robert wasn't particularly rich.
13068,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
13069,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
13070,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
13071,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",Haven't a clue.
13072,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY","Go on, your best guess."
13073,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY","Pounds, tons, ounces?"
13074,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
13075,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",That can't be.
13076,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
13077,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",Then how do we pay for anything?
13078,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
13079,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",How much?
13080,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",A tremendous amount.
13081,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY","There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement."
13082,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
13083,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
13084,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY","And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect."
13085,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY","It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do."
13086,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY","I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you."
13087,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
13088,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"KING'S LANDING, DAY",The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
13089,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"WESTEROS WOODS, NIGHT",Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
13090,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"WESTEROS WOODS, NIGHT",Would you shut up?
13091,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"WESTEROS WOODS, NIGHT",I can't sleep until I say the names.
13092,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"WESTEROS WOODS, NIGHT",The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
13093,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"WESTEROS WOODS, NIGHT",Only the ones I'm going to kill.
13094,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"WESTEROS WOODS, NIGHT","(chuckles) Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list."
13095,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"WESTEROS WOODS, NIGHT","If he were here right now, what would you do?"
13096,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"WESTEROS WOODS, NIGHT","I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men."
13097,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"WESTEROS WOODS, NIGHT",I'm almost done. Only one name left.
13098,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"WESTEROS WOODS, NIGHT",Go on.
13099,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"WESTEROS WOODS, NIGHT",The Hound.

13102,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT",Really?
13103,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT","Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat."
13104,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT","My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food."
13105,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT","This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?"
13106,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT",They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
13107,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT","Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder."
13108,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT",Yes. I'm very lucky.
13109,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT",He feels responsible for you.
13110,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT","Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful."
13111,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT",Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?
13112,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT","Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much."
13113,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT",Loved your mother.
13114,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT",No.
13115,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT",That's what you wanted to say.
13116,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT","He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you."
13117,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT","Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?"
13118,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT",No.
13119,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT",He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?
13120,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT","No, never."
13121,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT",Are you pregnant?
13122,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT","What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-"
13123,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT",I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?
13124,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT","Aunt Lysa, no, I-"

I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever."
13131,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"AN EYRIE DINING ROOM, NIGHT",Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm.
13132,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"THE KINGSROAD, DAY",Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?
13133,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"THE KINGSROAD, DAY","Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters."
13134,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"THE KINGSROAD, DAY","Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather."
13135,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"THE KINGSROAD, DAY",That's a long way off.
13136,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"THE KINGSROAD, DAY","Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point."

13150,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,THE HOUND AND ARYA'S CAMP,They will if you nance around like that. That's no way to fight.
13151,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,THE HOUND AND ARYA'S CAMP,It's not fighting. It's water dancing.
13152,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,THE HOUND AND ARYA'S CAMP,Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?
13153,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,THE HOUND AND ARYA'S CAMP,"The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos."

13164,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,THE HOUND AND ARYA'S CAMP,Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
13165,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,THE HOUND AND ARYA'S CAMP,He was outnumbered.
13166,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,THE HOUND AND ARYA'S CAMP,Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
13167,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,THE HOUND AND ARYA'S CAMP,Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.

13176,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,I didn't realize you were a poet.
13177,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,Not a very good one.

13183,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.
13184,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,Beautiful name.
13185,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,"Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry."
13186,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,"Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?"
13187,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,Which joke is that?
13188,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?

13193,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
13194,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,"We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year."
13195,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,"The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun."
13196,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.
13197,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
13198,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,"Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again."
13199,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,Anything at all.
13200,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.
13201,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
13202,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,KING'S LANDING GARDEN_1,Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.

13216,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"THE KINGSROAD, DAY_1",I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.
13217,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"THE KINGSROAD, DAY_1","Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?"
13218,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"THE KINGSROAD, DAY_1",I killed a man.
13219,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"THE KINGSROAD, DAY_1",Who?
13220,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"THE KINGSROAD, DAY_1",A Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.

13222,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"THE KINGSROAD, DAY_1",I pushed a spear through the back of his head.

13342,davos seaworth,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,"This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."

13344,stannis baratheon,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,He shares no blood with me. He is a bastard born of incest. As was his brother before him.
13345,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,"Yes, we have heard this story."
13346,stannis baratheon,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,It's not a story. It's the truth.
13347,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,The king's grandfather tells a different story. A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.

13349,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?

13351,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,"Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like ""usurper"" and ""madman"" and ""blood right."" Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?"
13352,stannis baratheon,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,"4,000."
13353,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,"And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay."

13357,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.

13359,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,"I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles."
13360,davos seaworth,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,"Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another.  {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers."
13361,davos seaworth,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,"This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive."
13362,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,The war is over.
13363,davos seaworth,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,"As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?"

13369,stannis baratheon,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,"67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?"
13370,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,That is a problem for another time.
13371,davos seaworth,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber,"Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it."

13590,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Tywin's chambers.,"Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line."
13591,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Tywin's chambers.,I'm well aware of your oath.
13592,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Tywin's chambers.,What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?
13593,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Tywin's chambers.,What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
13594,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Tywin's chambers.,It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
13595,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Tywin's chambers.,Done.
13596,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Tywin's chambers.,"When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again."
13597,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Tywin's chambers.,You have my word.
13598,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Tywin's chambers.,And you have mine.
13599,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"Not going well, is it?"
13600,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,You're going to be found guilty.
13601,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"Oh, you think so?"
13602,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch."
13603,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
13604,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
13605,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,How do you know?
13606,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Do you trust me?
13607,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,(nods)
13608,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.
13609,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,The crown may call its next witness.
13610,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,State your name.
13611,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Shae.
13612,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
13613,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,I swear it.
13614,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Do you know this man?
13615,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
13616,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,How do you know him?
13617,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
13618,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?
13619,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,I know that he's guilty.
13620,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,He and Sansa planned it together.
13621,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Silence! Continue.
13622,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord."
13623,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
13624,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
13625,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.
13626,mace tyrell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,I beg your pardon? You said you were his...
13627,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,His whore.
13628,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,How did you come to be in his service?
13629,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. ""You belong to me now,"" he said. ""I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."""
13630,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Silence. Silence!
13631,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,And did you?
13632,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Did I what?
13633,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
13634,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him ""my lion,"" so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, ""I am yours and you are mine."""
13635,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Shae. Please don't.
13636,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her."
13637,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess."
13638,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,You wish to confess?
13639,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
13640,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?
13641,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?"
13642,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,You admit you poisoned the king?
13643,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf."
13644,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
13645,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life."
13646,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Have you nothing to say in your defense?
13647,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had."
13648,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"(To Cersei) Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores."
13649,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,(To the crowd) I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
13650,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
13651,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.
13652,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY",I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
13653,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY","I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?"
13654,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY","You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"
13655,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY","Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it."
13656,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY",You fell in love with a whore.
13657,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY","Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
13658,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY",Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
13659,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY",At least I got to tell them what they really are.
13660,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY","Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."
13661,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY","Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
13662,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY",I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
13663,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY","Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
13664,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY",(laughs)
13665,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY",Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
13666,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY",It is tempting.
13667,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY","Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life."
13668,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY",If he wins.
13669,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY",Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
13670,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CELL, DAY",No. Not Ser Meryn.
13674,cersei lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING BATTLE PIT, DAY",Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.
13675,cersei lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING BATTLE PIT, DAY",You seem to be in good form.
13676,gregor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING BATTLE PIT, DAY",Who am I fighting?
13677,cersei lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING BATTLE PIT, DAY",Does it matter?
13678,gregor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING BATTLE PIT, DAY",(Shakes his head.)
13679,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,Could be food.
13680,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,Could be soldiers.
13681,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
13682,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,"Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down."
13683,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,"Who were ""they""?"
13684,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,I stopped asking a while ago.
13685,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,That's not gonna get better.
13686,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,Doesn't seem so.
13687,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?
13688,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.
13689,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,So why go on?
13690,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,Habit.
13691,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,Nothing could be worse than this.
13692,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,Maybe nothing is worse than this.
13693,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.
13694,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,Who are you?
13695,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,My name is Arya. Arya Stark.
13696,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,You her father?
13697,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,(Shakes his head.) Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
13698,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,"A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work."
13699,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,Wish it were wine.
13700,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,So do I.
13701,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.
13702,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,The fuck you doing?
13703,rorge,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,There's a price on your head.
13704,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
13705,rorge,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.
13706,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,"And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?"
13707,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
13708,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?
13709,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,He can't be. I don't know his name.
13710,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,What's your name?
13711,rorge,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,Rorge.
13712,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,Thank you.
13713,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,THE RIVERLANDS_6,You're learning.
13717,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD_3,Greetings.
13719,sam,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD_3,"All right, Jon?"
13721,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD_3,Lord Snow.
13722,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD_3,This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.
13723,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD_3,"Come on, Ghost."
13724,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
13725,janos slynt,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,"I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?"
13726,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,We need to prepare.
13727,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,We've been preparing.
13728,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
13729,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,And how would we range north?
13730,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,We wouldn't.
13731,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,"Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?"
13732,grenn,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,We can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.
13733,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,"This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel."
13734,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,"Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have."
13735,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.
13736,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,They won't stop them.
13737,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,"Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow."
13738,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,The stewards.
13739,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
13740,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,No.
13741,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,Who would that be?
13742,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,The builders.
13743,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,"Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?"
13744,othell yarwyck,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,(Pauses.) No.
13745,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,"Given your deep knowledge of the Wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon."
13746,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,"Moving on. First Builder, we'll need a hundred barrels of pitch brought atop the wall."
13747,othell yarwyck,4,37,mockingbird,CASTLE BLACK HALL,Aye.
13748,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",My lord.
13749,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",You have new clothes.
13750,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
13751,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",I sent for you days ago.
13752,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",I've been a bit busy.
13753,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",Doing what?
13754,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
13755,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
13756,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
13757,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",She's dim-witted.
13758,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL","If I wanted wits, I'd marry you."
13759,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL","When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?"
13760,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL","Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister."
13761,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",And you understand the rules of inheritance?
13762,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",Falyse is forty and barren.
13763,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
13764,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
13765,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",(scoffs.)
13766,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
13767,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
13768,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL","You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price."
13769,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",Is it two wives you want or two castles?
13770,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL","One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle."
13771,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
13772,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?
13773,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
13774,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL","Your sister's a Lannister, too."
13775,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL","My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."
13776,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL","If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink."
13777,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",Does he frighten you so much?
13778,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL","I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"
13779,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",Because you're my friend.
13780,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL","Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?"
13781,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL","I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more."
13782,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",I understand.
13783,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",I'm sorry it has to be this way.
13784,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
13785,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",We had some good days together.
13786,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL","Yes, we did."
13787,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",What will you do?
13788,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
13789,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION's CELL",I hope to hear them sing it one day.

13798,daario naharis,4,37,mockingbird,"MEEREEN, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT","I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents."
13799,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,"MEEREEN, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT",I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
13800,daario naharis,4,37,mockingbird,"MEEREEN, DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT",You've ordered us to be night watchmen.

13814,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night",I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
13815,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night",Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
13816,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night","No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one."
13817,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night","When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, ""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count."" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid."
13818,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night",It was. I- humor isn't my strength.
13819,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night",That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
13820,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night","If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?"
13821,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night",Not always.
13822,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night","Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lord's power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust."
13823,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night",Did you use it with Stannis?
13824,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night",No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
13825,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night",It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.
13826,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night","No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home."
13827,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night",I understand how you feel.
13828,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night",Hmm.
13829,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night",But that is impossible.
13830,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night",Why?
13831,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night","You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself."
13832,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,"Bathing room at Storm's End, night","However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her."

13834,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,Khaleesi.
13835,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,You're here early.
13836,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,Later than some.
13837,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,You don't approve?
13838,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,"It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust."
13839,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,You neither approve nor trust.
13840,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
13841,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
13842,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,I did.
13843,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,I trust you.
13844,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
13845,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
13846,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,You have?
13847,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,I have.
13848,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,"Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control."
13849,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,"That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself."
13850,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,"Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."
13851,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
13852,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,"It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
13853,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
13854,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,"I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi."
13855,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
13856,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
13857,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
13858,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,Hizdahr zo Loraq?
13859,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
13860,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,(Nods.)
13861,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,"Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind."
13862,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,"Yes, Khaleesi."
13863,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,DAENERYS'S CHAMBERS.,No. Tell him you changed my mind.

13870,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,"THE RIVERLANDS, DAY","I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword."
13871,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,"THE RIVERLANDS, DAY",My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
13872,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,"THE RIVERLANDS, DAY",Why?
13873,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,"THE RIVERLANDS, DAY","Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?"
13874,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,"THE RIVERLANDS, DAY",Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
13875,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,"AN INN, NIGHT",Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.

13883,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,"AN INN, NIGHT",Thanks. I do my best.
13884,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,"AN INN, NIGHT","A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?"
13885,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,"AN INN, NIGHT",No.
13886,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,"AN INN, NIGHT","Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?"

13888,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,"AN INN, NIGHT",Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had seventeen-

13891,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,"AN INN, NIGHT","No, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here."

13895,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,"It's nothing, my lady."

13898,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
13899,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
13900,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
13901,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,What about? Not kidney pie.
13902,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.
13903,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.
13904,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,She weren't when I last spoke to her.
13905,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,When was that?
13906,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,"Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry."
13907,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,So what happened to her?
13908,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,Well-
13909,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,The quick version.
13910,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.
13911,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,The Hound.
13912,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,"That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better."
13913,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,OUTSIDE THE INN,"Um, you were saying?"
13914,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,THE KING'S ROAD,"Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun."
13915,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,THE KING'S ROAD,"They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady."
13916,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,THE KING'S ROAD,Why the Eyrie?
13917,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,THE KING'S ROAD,"Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who."
13918,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,THE KING'S ROAD,"Sansa could be there, too."
13919,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,THE KING'S ROAD,"Aye, my lady. Could be."

13926,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",Oh.
13927,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.
13928,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
13929,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.
13930,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
13931,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT","Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago."
13932,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",I think I would have remembered that.
13933,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT","Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you."
13934,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
13935,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT","The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy."
13936,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",That would have made things so much easier.
13937,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT","When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."""
13938,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT","Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
13939,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
13940,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT","If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
13941,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT",I disagree.
13942,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,"TYRION'S CELL, NIGHT","I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion."
13943,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,"Hello, Robin."
13944,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,What are you doing?
13945,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,"I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time."
13946,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,Why did you leave?
13947,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,It's a long story.
13948,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
13949,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,"Yes, you certainly are."
13950,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,When will you go back?
13951,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
13952,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
13953,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,"No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."
13954,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?
13955,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,We don't.
13956,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?
13957,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
13958,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,"Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door."
13959,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,I like the sound of that.
13960,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
13961,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,All right.
13962,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,It can go in here in this big tower.
13963,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
13964,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,I didn't ruin it.
13965,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,You did.
13966,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it.
13967,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.
13968,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,I didn't ruin it!
13969,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,You're being stupid.
13970,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,I didn't ruin it!
13971,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,"Robin, I'm sorry, I-"
13972,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,Children.
13973,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,I hit him.
13974,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,"Yes, I saw."
13975,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,I shouldn't have done that.
13976,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,"No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction."
13977,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,If he tells Aunt Lysa...
13978,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
13979,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.
13980,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,"A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one."
13981,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.
13982,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,"I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world."
13983,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,You're more beautiful than she ever was.
13984,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,Lord Baelish...
13985,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE COURTYARD,Call me Petyr.
13986,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,"You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?"
13987,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,"Come here, Sansa."
13988,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,Do you know how far the fall is?
13989,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,No.
13990,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,"Neither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did."
13991,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,"I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen-"
13992,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,"Don't be coy with me, you little whore. You kissed him. You kissed Petyr."
13993,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,I didn't. You don't understand.
13994,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,I saw you! You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.
13995,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,He kissed me. I pulled away.
13996,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,Liar! Whore! He is mine!
13997,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,Please!
13998,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,"My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me. Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down!"
13999,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,Lysa! Let her go.
14000,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,You want her? This empty-headed child?
14001,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,Let her go.
14002,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,She's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why?
14003,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,"I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa."
14004,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,"Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife."
14005,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,THE EYRIE THRONE ROOM,"I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister."
14008,mole's town whore,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Opening Scene_27,"You fucking dick! Same wrong guess every fucking time. Listen, ya cunt."
14010,mole's town whore,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Opening Scene_27,"There's a man with an ear. Too bad you've got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your britches down, I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?"
14011,gilly,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Opening Scene_27,Yes.
14012,mole's town whore,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Opening Scene_27,"Well, what are you going to say?"
14013,gilly,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Opening Scene_27,I'm sorry it woke you up.
14014,mole's town whore,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Opening Scene_27,"I don't care if you're sorry. Keep that baby quiet, or I will."
14015,gilly,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Opening Scene_27,Don't you ever touch him.
14016,mole's town whore,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Opening Scene_27,"Hehehe, little Wildling bitch. You should've stayed with your own kind. *an owl hoots in the distance* Are you listening to me?"
14017,gilly,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Opening Scene_27,Shut your mouth.
14018,mole's town whore,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Opening Scene_27,What? It's just an owl you dumb bitch.
14019,gilly,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Opening Scene_27,No it's not.
14020,sam,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,I should never have left her there.
14021,jon snow,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,You couldn't have known.
14022,sam,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,Of course I could've known. They were raiding the villages close by.
14023,grenn,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers?
14024,eddard stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.
14025,grenn,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,"Oh, so it's alright then?! Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!"
14026,eddard stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,I didn't say it was alright! I'm sayin' they shouldn't have been there.
14027,grenn,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,We pledged to guard the realms of men.
14028,sam,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,She's dead because of me.
14029,grenn,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,We can't even guard Mole's Town.
14030,jon snow,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,"We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want."
14031,sam,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.
14032,pypar,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,"Maybe she managed to hide herself. I thought one of you was dead, you went North with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did."
14033,eddard stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met. She survived the long march to the wall. She survived a white walker for fuck's sake. She might've got out.
14034,sam,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,She might have.
14035,jon snow,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,"If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close."
14036,eddard stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,A hundred thousand.
14037,grenn,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,"And there's what, 5 of us left."
14038,eddard stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,"If you're counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully. A hundred and two."
14039,pypar,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?
14040,eddard stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_2,"Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back."
14041,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,You think he was spying on you?
14042,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,"No, not spying."
14043,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.
14044,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,Yes your grace.
14045,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,But you are not Dothraki.
14046,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,No.
14047,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,"Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes."
14048,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,He was interested.
14049,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,What?
14050,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,I believe he was interested.
14051,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,"When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?"
14052,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,All of it?
14053,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,The...the pillar an the stones.
14054,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,"I don't know, your grace."
14055,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,Haven't you ever wondered?
14056,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,"Yes, your grace."
14057,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.
14058,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,*in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.
14059,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,*in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.
14060,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,*in Valyrian* No.
14061,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,"The lessons you give I in Common tongue, these are precious to I."
14062,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,To me.
14063,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,To me.
14064,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,I don't remember teaching you the word precious.
14065,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,"Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word."
14066,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,Do you remember the name you were given at birth?
14067,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,I remember nothing. Only unsullied.
14068,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,"When they cut you, do you remember that?"
14069,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.
14070,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,Why? Why sorry?
14071,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
14072,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,"*approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry."
14073,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,*in Valyrian* Grey Worm.
14074,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,*in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.
14075,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN,*in Valyrian* So am I.
14076,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,"Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?"
14077,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,"I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands."
14078,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,And what are you really?
14079,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,I'm Reek.
14080,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,"Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud."
14081,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,I'm Reek.
14082,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,Until when?
14083,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,Always. Forever.
14084,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
14086,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,"I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?"
14087,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,Yes.
14088,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,And why should I believe that?
14089,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
14091,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,"And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?"
14092,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
14093,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,And what does Lord Bolton want?
14094,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
14095,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,He wants us to surrender?
14096,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,"My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you."
14097,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,...shame fought with honor.
14098,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear..."
14099,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?
14100,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,*scared* You don't know.
14101,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,The Ironborn will not surrender.
14102,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,*whispering* Reek. Reek.
14103,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,"You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?"
14104,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,Reek.
14106,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
14107,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,"You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?"
14108,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
14109,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN,I believe we will. To our new home.
14110,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally."
14111,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
14112,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce."
14113,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black."
14114,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,My lord...
14115,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn..."
14116,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
14117,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair."
14118,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
14119,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
14120,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door."
14121,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
14122,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,We were told there was a witness. A girl.
14123,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"A niece of yours, I believe."
14124,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help."
14125,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,We'd like to speak with her.
14126,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,Let me fetch her.
14127,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
14128,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room."
14129,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,My lady...
14130,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,I wasn't asking you.
14131,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,He can stay.
14132,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw."
14133,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"*to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
14134,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Please, Alayne, leave nothing out."
14135,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
14136,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?"
14137,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."
14138,vance corbray,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Your secret is safe with us, my lady."
14139,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
14140,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa."
14141,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
14142,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,Lady Sansa.
14143,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
14144,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault."
14145,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
14146,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
14147,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly."
14148,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same."
14149,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?"
14150,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl."
14151,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,Are you questioning our courage?
14152,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?"
14153,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
14154,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?"
14155,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead."
14156,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale."
14157,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
14158,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
14159,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,More often they die young.
14160,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse."
14161,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Aye, it's time."
14162,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE,"Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest."
14164,barristan selmy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Yes? Who sent you?
14165,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Ser Barristan.
14166,barristan selmy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Ser Jorah.
14167,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Have I forgotten a council meeting?
14168,barristan selmy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,No.
14169,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,What's this?
14170,barristan selmy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.
14171,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Who gave you this?
14172,barristan selmy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Does it matter?
14173,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Have you told her?
14174,barristan selmy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back."
14175,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Let me speak with her in private.
14176,barristan selmy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,You'll never be alone with her again.
14177,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Why did the usurper pardon you?
14178,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,If we could speak alone.
14179,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"No, speak to me here. Explain it to me."
14180,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him."
14181,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
14182,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,It is not forged.
14183,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"Why, then?"
14184,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing."
14185,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,What was the content of these letters?
14186,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Information.
14187,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,What information?
14188,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
14189,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
14190,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,I...
14191,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Yes or no?
14192,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Khaleesi.
14193,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
14194,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Yes.
14195,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
14196,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,I stopped you from drinking his wine.
14197,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Because you knew it was poisoned.
14198,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,I suspected.
14199,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,You betrayed me from the first.
14200,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me."
14201,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
14202,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.
14203,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,...and you want me to forgive you?
14204,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,I have loved you.
14205,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can."
14206,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"Daenerys, please."
14207,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now."
14208,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"Moat Cailin is yours, Father."
14209,house bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?
14210,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,No.
14211,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see."
14212,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"Moors, fields, hills."
14213,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,Tell me what you see.
14214,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,Nothing.
14215,roose bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?"
14216,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,Ramsay Snow.
14217,roose bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North."
14218,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise."
14219,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath."
14220,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,Yes?
14221,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?"
14222,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
14223,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,That's not an answer.
14224,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?"
14225,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,I don't know.
14226,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,Neither do I.
14227,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?
14228,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,I know what you want.
14229,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,Do you?
14230,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,"I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy."
14231,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,Lots of things make me happy.
14232,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,Like what?
14233,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,"Killing Polliver, killing Rorge."
14234,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?
14235,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
14236,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,"Aye, nothing in the world beats that look."
14237,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
14238,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,"I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel."
14239,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
14240,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,*laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*
14241,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,You should have let me burn it.
14242,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,It's a fleabite.
14243,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
14244,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,"Well, we won't have to walk too much further."
14245,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,You really think my aunt will pay for me?
14246,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,"Aye, she'll pay."
14247,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,I've never even met her.
14248,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,"Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about."
14249,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,I'm not a lady.
14251,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE,"The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn."
14253,robin arryn,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_2,"I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave."
14254,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_2,You shouldn't be.
14255,robin arryn,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_2,"The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside."
14256,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_2,It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
14257,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_2,Shall we go?
14258,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
14259,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Soon.
14260,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,"Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
14261,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,I've never seen him fight.
14262,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,"Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
14263,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Oberyn believes in himself.
14264,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
14265,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Beheading.
14266,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,"Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
14267,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Cousins.
14268,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,"Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
14269,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
14270,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
14272,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Nothing made him happier.
14273,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
14274,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
14275,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,"The joke wore thin, though."
14276,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,For you. You drifted away.
14277,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,I had other interests.
14278,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,"Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
14279,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Why?
14280,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,"I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
14281,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
14282,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,"Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
14283,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,"Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
14284,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,"I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
14285,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,He was twice your size.
14286,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,"He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
14287,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,I don't know.
14288,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Good luck today.
14289,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Looks like very light armor.
14290,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,I like to move around.
14291,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
14292,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
14293,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
14294,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Today is not the day I die.
14295,ellaria sand,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,You're going to fight that?
14296,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,I'm going to kill that.
14297,ellaria sand,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,He is the biggest man I've ever seen.
14298,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
14299,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Thank the gods.
14300,pycelle,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,"In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion..."
14301,ellaria sand,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Don't leave me alone in this world.
14302,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Never.
14303,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Have they told you who I am?
14304,the mountain,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Some dead man.
14305,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
14306,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
14307,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
14308,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
14309,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,You raped her! You murdered her!
14310,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,You killed her children!
14311,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,"Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!"
14312,the mountain,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!
14313,tywin lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_21,"*standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death.1Embed"
14314,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,What was she like?
14315,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,She...she had red hair.
14316,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Oh? How big were her feet?
14317,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Well what do you want me to say?
14318,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
14319,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,So you and Gilly never-
14320,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
14321,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"But if she had, you would've? You'd have broken your vows?"
14322,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women."
14323,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,What?
14324,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"""I shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation."
14325,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
14326,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?"
14327,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
14328,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"No, you're really not."
14329,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
14330,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
14331,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,There will.
14332,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
14333,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch."
14334,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?
14335,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Yes.
14336,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--"
14337,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.
14338,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,We could be waiting here a while.
14339,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting."
14340,styr,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.
14341,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon."
14342,styr,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.
14343,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I probably killed him already.
14344,styr,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,So you've said.
14345,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
14346,styr,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
14347,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?"
14348,styr,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Maybe I have.
14349,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me."
14350,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?"
14351,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Maester Aemon. How did you know-
14352,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
14353,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Let me help you.
14354,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?"
14355,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Maester Faull
14356,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library."
14357,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
14358,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
14359,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I don't love her.
14360,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Yes you do.
14361,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,No.
14362,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.
14363,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You were?
14364,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?"
14365,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that."
14366,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You know who I was before I came here? What I could've been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.
14367,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Who was she?
14368,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.
14369,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!"
14370,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!"
14371,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"I'm sorry, I can't."
14372,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do."
14373,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Pyp! Open the gate.
14374,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I can't.
14375,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Sam, is that you?!"
14376,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Yes!
14377,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
14378,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!"
14379,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I've never heard you curse before.
14380,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Yes, well, best get used to it."
14381,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella."
14382,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,It was horrible.
14383,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.
14384,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Don't let them send me away, Sam."
14385,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Never.
14386,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I know there's no women allowed.
14387,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too."
14388,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Get ready!
14389,thenn warg,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,It's time.
14390,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Pick up the pace!
14391,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser."
14392,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,A hundred thousand you say?
14393,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Yes sir.
14394,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You can say it if you like. We should've sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.
14395,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"It was a difficult decision either way, Ser."
14396,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job."
14397,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
14398,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You're leaving me again?
14399,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I'm not leaving you!
14400,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.
14401,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I...I didn't mean in the same room.
14402,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,What are you going to do out there?
14403,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Help my brothers.
14404,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.
14405,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
14406,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here."
14407,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do."
14408,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Promise me you won't die.
14409,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I promise you I won't die.
14410,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.
14411,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?
14412,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us."
14413,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?"
14414,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid."
14415,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,But you're afraid now?
14416,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore."
14417,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
14418,styr,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,How high are the walls?
14419,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened."
14420,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Let's kill some Crows!
14421,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,*yells* Come on! *puts out the fire*
14422,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Archers knock, everyone else hold."
14423,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!
14424,night's watch,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,No Ser!
14425,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!
14426,night's watch,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,No Ser!
14427,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You all plan to die here tonight?
14428,night's watch,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,No Ser!
14429,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,That's very good to hear. Draw!
14431,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,They're attacking the southern gates!
14432,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Now?
14433,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Now!
14434,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"I'm going down then. Brother Slynt, you have The Wall."
14435,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,What?!
14436,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"What are you fucking waiting for, loose!"
14437,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You heard the man. Loose!
14438,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"You, over there."
14439,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Did you get one?
14440,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"No. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam."
14441,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Yeah?
14442,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I think we're gonna die.
14443,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,If you keep missing we will.
14444,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?
14445,night's watch,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,No!
14446,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you, Castle Black will stand."
14447,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,The Night's Watch will stand.
14448,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"With me now! Now, with me!"
14449,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders."
14450,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,We can't just let them attack the gate!
14451,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"The bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel."
14452,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?"
14453,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.
14454,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, he said he needs ya."
14455,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Needed below? Yes. Yes.
14456,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!
14457,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,They won't summit before dawn.
14458,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,How do you know that?
14459,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Because I've made that claim.
14460,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.
14461,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Knock! Draw! Loose!
14462,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"I got one. Right through the heart, he's dead."
14463,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Oh, is it over?"
14464,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Huh?
14465,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*
14466,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright."
14467,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Now!
14468,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Now!
14469,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"*to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate."
14470,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Alright.
14471,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,*grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...
14472,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"They won't. Come on Hill! And you Cooper! You three, on me! Come on you lazy bastards!"
14473,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Oil!
14474,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Oil on the ramp!
14475,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Protect the gate!
14476,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Hold the fucking gate! Hold it!
14477,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,*to Grenn* We need more men down here.
14478,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,We have to hold the gate.
14479,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,But we need men here.
14480,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Tell Jon! He's in command. *to the men behind him* Let's go!
14481,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,*to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!
14482,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?"
14483,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!"
14484,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,What are you doing up here?
14485,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.
14486,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them."
14487,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Two brothers now fight with me.
14488,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Might as well enjoy our last night, right boys? Light the fuckers up. Knock! Draw! Loose!"
14489,donnel hill,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,How are we gonna stop that?
14490,cooper,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,We shot twenty-eight arrows in him already.
14491,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"You heard Jon, we hold the gate."
14492,donnel hill,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.
14493,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,We hold the gate!
14494,donnel hill,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Mother save me. Father save me.
14495,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us, you hear me?"
14496,donnel hill,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"No, please."
14497,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns"
14499,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,*to Sam* I don't want you out there.
14500,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
14501,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I need him more than I need you.
14502,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,We need you boy.
14503,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Jon Snow.
14504,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"No, shh, don't talk."
14505,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Do you remember that cave?
14506,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,We should've stayed in that cave.
14507,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,We'll go back there.
14508,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
14509,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Drop the scythe, boys!"
14510,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Hoister up!
14511,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,They've had enough for one night.
14512,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Don't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us a thousand to one.
14513,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Tormund. It's over, let it end."
14514,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,This is how a man ends.
14515,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Put him in chains. We'll question him later.
14516,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I should've thrown you from the top of your wall boy!
14517,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Aye, you should've."
14518,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?"
14519,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,We held them off.
14520,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,For one night.
14521,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,This is a great victory.
14522,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them."
14523,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Where are you going?
14524,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I'm going to find Mance.
14525,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.
14526,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home."
14527,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Without Mance? You're going to kill him?
14528,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I'm going to try.
14529,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him."
14530,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
14531,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!
14532,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?
14533,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,"They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out."
14534,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,What are you doing?
14535,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
14536,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Opening Scene_28,Jon. Come back.
14537,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,You're wearing a black cloak again.
14538,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,I've been sent to negotiate with you.
14539,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was."
14540,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows."
14541,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?"
14542,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
14543,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Did you see her again at Castle Black?
14544,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Yes.
14545,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,And?
14546,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,She's dead.
14547,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Your doing?
14548,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,No.
14549,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,We'll drink to her.
14550,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last."
14551,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Ygritte.
14552,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Ygritte.
14553,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,That's not wine.
14554,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty."
14555,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
14556,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
14557,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Grenn came from a farm.
14558,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Mag and Grenn.
14559,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Grenn and Mag.
14560,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?"
14561,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Turn your army around and go home.
14562,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?
14563,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
14564,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black."
14565,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?"
14566,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,You attacking us?
14567,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"No, it's like you said, we don't have the men."
14568,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Hold! To me. To me.
14569,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.
14570,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,You're the king beyond the wall?
14571,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,You know who I am?
14572,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Never had the pleasure.
14573,davos seaworth,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms."
14574,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.
14575,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
14576,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,We do not kneel.
14577,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king."
14578,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"All the same, we do not kneel."
14579,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Take these men away.
14580,davos seaworth,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?
14581,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
14582,davos seaworth,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.
14583,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son."
14584,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Your father was an honorable man.
14585,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"He was, your grace."
14586,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,What do you think he'd have done with him?
14587,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"I was this man's prisoner once. He could've tortured me, he could've killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father would've taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
14588,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,Very well. *to Davos* Take him.
14589,jon snow,4,40,the children,Opening Scene_29,"Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them."
14590,pycelle,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.
14591,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Bloody Martells.
14592,pycelle,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,The cause appears to be manticore venom.
14593,qyburn,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"It is, yes, manticore."
14594,pycelle,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done."
14595,qyburn,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Yes there is.
14596,pycelle,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,May I ask what you think you're doing?
14597,qyburn,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Saving him.
14598,pycelle,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester."
14599,qyburn,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.
14600,pycelle,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion."
14601,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"You're dismissed, Grand Maester."
14602,pycelle,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Your grace. This is my laboratory!
14603,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Not anymore.
14604,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,You can save him?
14605,qyburn,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance."
14606,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.
14607,qyburn,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"Thank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat."
14608,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Will it weaken him?
14609,qyburn,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Oh no.
14610,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Very well then.
14611,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed."
14612,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,I'm opening it again.
14613,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
14614,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,I will not.
14615,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was."
14616,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king."
14617,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-"
14618,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.
14619,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?
14620,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away."
14621,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,No.
14622,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen."
14623,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,And how will you do that?
14624,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,I'll tell everyone the truth.
14625,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,And what truth would that be?
14626,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you would've known."
14627,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Known what?
14628,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.
14629,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"No, no, no, no, no."
14630,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Your legacy is a lie.
14631,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,I don't believe you.
14632,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Yes you do.
14633,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Jaime.
14634,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?"
14635,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine."
14636,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Tyrion is your family.
14637,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,He's not.
14638,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,You don't get to choose.
14639,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-"
14640,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
14641,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?"
14642,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-"
14643,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,I choose you.
14644,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Those are words.
14645,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.
14646,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Told him what?
14647,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,I told him about us.
14648,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,You told him?
14649,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you."
14650,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,You think he'll just accept that?
14651,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Go and ask him.
14652,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,What did you say?
14653,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,"I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters."
14654,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,Someone will walk in.
14655,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_22,I don't care.
14656,missandei,4,40,the children,MEREEN,"*in Valyrian* You stand before Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Mereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men. Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons."
14657,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN,"*in Valyrian* Thank you for seeing me, your grace. My name is Fennesz. I can speak the common tongue if you wish."
14658,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN,You speak it very well.
14659,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN,"Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much."
14660,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN,I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?
14661,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN,"When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets."
14662,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN,I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
14663,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN,"I do not mean to offend, your grace. I went to one of these places. The young prey on the old. Take what they want and beat us if we resist."
14664,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN,"My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you."
14665,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN,"Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children."
14666,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN,What is it that you want from me?
14667,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN,"Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal."
14668,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN,"You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?"
14669,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN,"Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-"
14670,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN,I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
14671,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN,"Thank you, your grace. Thank you."
14672,barristan selmy,4,40,the children,MEREEN,The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.
14673,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN,Approach my friend.
14675,missandei,4,40,the children,MEREEN,*in Low Valyrian* The Queen says you may approach.
14677,missandei,4,40,the children,MEREEN,*translating* I have brought you. He came from the sky. The black one. The winged shadow. He came from the sky and...
14678,missandei,4,40,the children,MEREEN,*translating* My girl. My little girl.
14679,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN,What was her name?
14680,missandei,4,40,the children,MEREEN,"Zala, your grace."
14681,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN,How old was she?
14682,missandei,4,40,the children,MEREEN,Three.
14683,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN,Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon?
14684,grey worm,4,40,the children,MEREEN,"*in Valyrian* Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago, my queen. Nothing since then."
14685,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN,*in Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs.
14686,aemon,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,"They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west. They died protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names. It is for us to remember them. Our brothers, we shall never see their like again."
14688,aemon,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,And now their watch is ended.
14689,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,Your old blind man patched me up. Why?
14690,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,"He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe."
14691,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,You want me alive so you can torture me?
14692,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,No one's going to torture you.
14693,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?
14694,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,I don't know what happens to the prisoners.
14695,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,Who decides?
14696,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,I suppose Stannis does.
14697,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,He your king now?
14698,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,I don't have a king.
14699,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,"You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow. You can never be a kneeler again."
14700,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?
14701,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,Words? What kind of words?
14702,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.
14703,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,Do what?
14704,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,Say farewell.
14705,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,"The dead can't hear us, boy."
14706,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,Snow. Did you love her? She loved you.
14707,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,She told you?
14708,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_3,No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That's how I know. She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me?
14709,meera reed,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,"We can stop, we can rest."
14710,jojen reed,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,We'll rest with the three-eyed raven.
14711,meera reed,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,We're not going to make it.
14712,jojen reed,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,We're already here.
14713,bran stark,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,"Jojen. Jojen! Look, Jojen, look."
14714,meera reed,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,JOJEN! Hold on!
14715,bran stark,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,Help them! Now!
14716,meera reed,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,Hold on to me!
14717,hodor,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,Hodor...
14718,bran stark,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,Help them!
14719,jojen reed,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,"Bran! Save yourself, now!"
14724,bran stark,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,Who are you?
14726,bran stark,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,You’re the three-eyed raven.
14728,meera reed,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,"My brother, he led us to you, and now he…"
14730,meera reed,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,How do you know?
14732,bran stark,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,I didn’t want anyone to die for me.
14734,bran stark,4,40,the children,BEYOND THE WALL_4,You’re going to help me walk again?
14736,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Podrick. Podrick! Where are the horses?
14737,podrick payne,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I hobbled them last night.
14738,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,What sort of hobble?
14739,podrick payne,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"A figure-eight, like you taught me."
14740,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,If you did it like I taught you then the horses would be here.
14741,podrick payne,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"Thieves, maybe?"
14742,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,It’s at least thirty miles to the Eyrie from here. You’re carrying the saddle bags.
14743,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"People coming. You can shit later, there’s people coming!"
14744,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Morning!
14745,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Morning.
14746,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I like your sword. Are we getting close to the bloody gate?
14747,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,About ten more miles.
14748,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Did you hear that Podrick? Only about ten more miles to the Bloody Gate.
14749,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Are you a knight?
14750,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,No.
14751,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,But you know how to use that sword.
14752,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I do.
14753,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Does it have a name?
14754,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,“Oathkeeper.”
14755,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Mine’s “Needle.”
14756,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Good name.
14757,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Who taught you how to fight?
14758,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,My father.
14759,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Mine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys.
14760,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"Mine said the same. But I kept fighting the boys anyway. Kept losing. Finally my father said, “If you’re going to do it, you might as well do it right.”"
14761,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"Seven blessings. I’m Brienne of Tarth, this is Podrick Payne."
14762,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You want something?
14763,podrick payne,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,That’s Sandor Clegane- the Hound.
14764,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You’re Arya Stark.
14765,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I asked if you wanted something.
14766,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.
14767,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,My mother’s dead.
14768,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I know. I wish I could’ve been there to protect her.
14769,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You’re not a northerner.
14770,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"I know, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her."
14771,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Why didn’t you?
14772,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King’s Landing.
14773,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You’re paid by the Lannisters. You’re here for the bounty on me.
14774,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I’m not paid by the Lannisters.
14775,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"No? Fancy sword you’ve got there. Where’d you get it? I’ve been looking at Lannister gold all my life. Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth, tell me that’s not Lannister gold."
14776,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.
14777,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,The Bloody Gate’s ten miles.
14778,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I swore to your mother by the Old Gods and the New -
14779,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I don’t care what you swore!
14780,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Arya!
14781,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You heard the girl! She’s not coming with you.
14782,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,She is.
14783,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You’re not a good listener. Valyrian steel-- I’ve always wanted some Valyrian steel.
14784,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Come with me Arya. I’ll take you to safety.
14785,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"Safety?! Where the fuck’s that? Her aunt in the Eyrie’s dead. Her mother’s dead, her father’s dead, her brother’s dead. Winterfell’s a pile of rubble. There’s no safety, you dumb bitch. If you don’t know that by now, you’re the wrong one to watch over her."
14786,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,And that’s what you’re doing? Watching over her?
14787,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"Aye, that’s what I’m doing."
14788,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I have no wish to kill you Ser.
14789,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I’m not a knight.
14790,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Arya! Arya! ARYA! Where is she?
14791,podrick payne,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,She was just here...
14792,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Why weren’t you watching her?
14793,podrick payne,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I was watching you I thought you migth need some help…
14794,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Which way Pod? Which way did she go?
14795,podrick payne,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"Ah, I think that way."
14796,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Arya!
14797,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You’re still here? [Coughs] Big bitch saved you.
14798,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I don’t need saving.
14799,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"No, not you. You’re a real killer. With your water dancing, and your needle."
14800,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You’re gonna die?
14801,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"Unless there’s a Maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I’m done. I’d skin you alive for wine. [Arya offers water.] Fuck water! Killed by a woman. (Chuckles) I bet you liked that. Go on, go after her. She’ll help you. Going out alone, you won’t last a day out there."
14802,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I’ll last longer than you.
14803,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"You remember where the heart is? Fuck it. I’m ready. Go on, girl. Another name off your list. You kept promising me. I cut down your butcher’s boy, the ginger. He was begging for mercy. Please sir, please don’t kill me, please, please. Bled all over my horse. Saddle stunk of butcher’s boy for weeks. And your sister, your pretty sister. I should’ve taken her. That night the Blackwater burned, I should’ve fucked her bloody. At least I’d have one happy memory! Do I have to beg you? Do it. Do it."
14804,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Kill me. Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!
14805,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,"Oh, get on with it you son of a whore."
14806,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,Is that any way to speak about our mother?
14807,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,What’re you doing?
14808,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,What do you think I’m doing? The galley’s waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.
14809,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,Who’s helping you?
14810,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,Varys.
14811,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,Varys?
14812,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,You have more friends than you thought.
14813,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,"There’s a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open."
14814,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,"I suppose this is goodbye, then."
14815,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,"Farewell, little brother."
14816,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,"Jaime, thank you. For my life."
14817,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,Quickly now.
14819,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
14820,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,"Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we’ll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure…"
14821,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,"All my life, you’ve wanted me dead."
14822,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,"Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what’s yours. I’d never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I’d never let Illyn Payne take your head. You’re a Lannister. You’re my son."
14823,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,I loved her.
14824,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,Who?
14825,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,Shae.
14826,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,"Bah, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow."
14827,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,I murdered her. With my own hands.
14828,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,It doesn’t matter.
14829,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,It doesn’t matter?
14830,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,She was a whore!
14831,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,Say that word again.
14832,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,And what? You’ll kill your own father in the privy? No. You’re my son. Enough of this nonsense…
14833,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,"I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn’t poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?"
14834,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,Enough. We’ll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.
14835,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,I can’t go back there. She’s in there.
14836,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,"What, are you afraid of a dead whore?"
14837,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,You shot me. You’re no son of mine.
14838,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,I am your son. I have always been your son.
14839,varys,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_23,"What have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend, I’ve brought you this far."
14840,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_8,I want to see the captain.
14842,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_8,"I want to go north, to the wall."
14844,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_8,I can pay.
14846,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_8,"I wouldn’t need a cabin. Please, I could work, scrubbing the floors, or…"
14848,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_8,Where’s home?
14850,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_8,"Wait, I have something else."
14852,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_8,"It’s not silver, it’s iron."
14853,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_8,Valar morghulis.
14856,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,WOODS_3,Why not?
14858,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,WOODS_3,He’ll never know we’ve been gone.
14860,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,WOODS_3,You don’t need to be afraid of my father.
14862,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,WOODS_3,Yes.
14864,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,WOODS_3,Of course we should.
14865,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,Get out. Get out!
14867,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,No.
14868,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,Listen to your friend.
14869,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,They said that you were terrifying. With cat’s teeth and three eyes. You’re not terrifying. You’re boring.
14870,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,You don’t know what I am.
14871,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,I know you’re a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.
14872,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,Everybody wants to know their future. Until they know their future.
14873,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,This is my father’s land. My land. Tell me my future or I’ll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.
14874,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,Your blood. Give me a taste.
14875,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,Three questions you get. You won’t like the answers.
14876,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,I’ve been promised to the prince. When will we marry?
14877,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,You’ll never wed the prince. You’ll wed the king.
14878,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,But I will be queen?
14879,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,"Oh yes, you’ll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear."
14880,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,Will the king and I have children?
14881,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,"No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3."
14882,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,That doesn’t make sense.
14883,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,MAGGY’S HUT,Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.
14886,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY,They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.
14889,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY,They will wait.
14890,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,"He never wanted you to be a King’s Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body."
14891,jaime lannister,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,"What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They’re going to try to take it away, all of it."
14892,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,They?
14893,jaime lannister,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,All of them out there are enemies. They’re waiting a night to make sure he’s really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they’ll set to work on tearing us apart.
14894,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,"They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he’s the enemy. I’ve been telling you for years, you’ve been defending him for years…"
14895,jaime lannister,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,This is exactly what they want.
14896,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,...and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?
14897,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,"Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You’re a man of action, aren’t you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. (gestures towards Tywin) Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world."
14898,varys,5,41,the wars to come,CRATE - PENTOS,Apologies.
14899,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CRATE - PENTOS,I still don’t see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
14900,varys,5,41,the wars to come,CRATE - PENTOS,"I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”."
14901,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CRATE - PENTOS,Do you know what it’s like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
14902,varys,5,41,the wars to come,CRATE - PENTOS,No. I only know what it’s like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
14903,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CRATE - PENTOS,Pentos?
14904,varys,5,41,the wars to come,CRATE - PENTOS,"The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself."
14905,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CRATE - PENTOS,Much better.
14906,varys,5,41,the wars to come,CRATE - PENTOS,My lord?
14907,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CRATE - PENTOS,I don’t think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don’t suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
14908,varys,5,41,the wars to come,CRATE - PENTOS,You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
14909,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CRATE - PENTOS,In a box. Why stop now?
14910,varys,5,41,the wars to come,CRATE - PENTOS,Because we are talking about the future of our country.
14911,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CRATE - PENTOS,The future is shit. Just like the past.
14913,white rat,5,41,the wars to come,BROTHEL - MEEREEN,You… you don’t have to.

14916,barristan selmy,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN,"Yes, your grace. They left it on the body."
14917,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN,They’ve never killed before.
14918,barristan selmy,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN,"It was only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors are always met with resistance."
14919,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN,I didn’t conquer them. Their own people did.
14920,mossador,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN,"They do not see us as people, Your Grace."
14921,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN,"Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?"
14922,grey worm,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN,"White Rat, your grace."
14923,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN,I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.
14924,barristan selmy,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN,The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.
14925,mossador,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN,Make them very angry.
14926,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN,Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.
14927,missandei,5,41,the wars to come,HALLWAY_2,Torgo Nudho.
14928,grey worm,5,41,the wars to come,HALLWAY_2,Missandei hin Naath.
14929,missandei,5,41,the wars to come,HALLWAY_2,I wanted to speak with you.
14930,grey worm,5,41,the wars to come,HALLWAY_2,Why do you come?
14931,missandei,5,41,the wars to come,HALLWAY_2,"White Rat, the Unsullied who… I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen’s brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?"
14932,grey worm,5,41,the wars to come,HALLWAY_2,I do not know. I must go.
14933,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,Get your shield up.
14934,olly,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,It’s too heavy.
14935,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,"If it wasn’t heavy it wouldn’t stop a sword, now get it up."
14936,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I’ll ring your head like a bell.
14937,gilly,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,"Shouldn’t you be training, too?"
14938,sam,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,"Well, I’m hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they’ve killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!"
14939,alliser thorne,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,These men need a firm hand. Always have. They’re poachers and thieves.
14940,alliser thorne,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,Not soldiers.
14941,gilly,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,That one hates me.
14942,sam,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander… he hates the wildlings.
14943,sam,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,All the wildlings.
14944,gilly,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,Don’t let them send us away.
14945,sam,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,"It’s not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he’s a good man. He’s running against Ser Alliser--"
14946,gilly,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,Sam! Don’t let them send us away.
14947,sam,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,"I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too."
14948,gilly,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_4,"You can’t leave, they’ll execute you."

14953,melisandre,5,41,the wars to come,ELEVATOR - THE WALL,Feel.
14954,melisandre,5,41,the wars to come,ELEVATOR - THE WALL,Are you a virgin?
14955,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,ELEVATOR - THE WALL,No.
14956,melisandre,5,41,the wars to come,ELEVATOR - THE WALL,Good.
14957,melisandre,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell.
14958,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,You know who rules at Winterfell now?
14959,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,Roose Bolton.
14960,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark’s heart. Don’t you want to avenge him?
14961,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,"I want a great many things, your grace. But I’m a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch now."
14962,davos seaworth,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,I’ve been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.
14963,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,They’re good men.
14964,davos seaworth,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,Many don’t. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?
14965,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,It’s where she belonged.
14966,davos seaworth,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,Some of the Night’s Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.
14967,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn’t make them monsters.
14968,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can’t protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton’s head on a spike. But if I’m to take Winterfell I’ll need more men.
14969,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,The men of the Night’s Watch are sworn to play no part--
14970,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,I’m not talking about the damn Night’s Watch. I’m talking about the wildlings.
14971,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,"Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?"
14972,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,"If they swear to follow me, I’ll pardon them. We’ll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I’ll declare them citizens of the realm. I’ll give them land to live on."
14973,davos seaworth,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,It’s a fair offer. More than fair.
14974,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,I’ll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
14975,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,I don’t think that’s likely.
14976,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,"You admire him, don’t you?"
14977,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,I respect him.
14978,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...
14979,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,Your grace…
14980,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,...or he burns.
14981,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,THE WALL_2,How much time do I have?

14999,brienne of tarth,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE,Us? The only reason you’re here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren’t safe in the capital. You’re hundreds of miles from King’s Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You’re safe.
15000,podrick payne,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE,But I’m you’re squire.
15001,brienne of tarth,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE,Do you even know what a squire is?
15002,podrick payne,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE,An attendant to a knight?
15003,brienne of tarth,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE,I’m not a knight. That means you’re not a squire.
15004,podrick payne,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE,"Well, where would I go?"
15005,brienne of tarth,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE,"I don’t care, I’m not your mother."
15006,podrick payne,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE,You swore to find the Stark girls.
15007,brienne of tarth,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE,I found Arya. She didn’t want my protection.
15008,podrick payne,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE,Sansa still might.
15009,brienne of tarth,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE,Will you shut your mouth? I didn’t ask for advice. I don’t want anyone following me. I’m not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
15010,sansa stark,5,41,the wars to come,CARRIAGE,You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
15011,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,CARRIAGE,I did.
15012,sansa stark,5,41,the wars to come,CARRIAGE,But we’re heading west.
15013,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,CARRIAGE,We are.
15014,sansa stark,5,41,the wars to come,CARRIAGE,"If he wanted to betray us, he already would have."
15015,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,CARRIAGE,"Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he’s not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?"
15016,sansa stark,5,41,the wars to come,CARRIAGE,No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
15017,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,CARRIAGE,"No. But I pay them well, and they’ve seen what happens to men who disappoint me."
15018,sansa stark,5,41,the wars to come,CARRIAGE,So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?
15019,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,CARRIAGE,"So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can’t get her hands on you."
15020,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_6,"It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn’t presume to claim to have known him as such…"
15021,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a… what a force to be reckoned with.
15022,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,Thank you so much for your kind words.
15024,lancel lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,Your grace.
15025,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
15026,lancel lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,My deepest sympathies.
15027,kevan lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,I apologize for my son’s appearance.
15028,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,"Uncle, it’s quite alright."
15029,kevan lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,"They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point… They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive."
15030,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,I’m sure he’ll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.
15031,kevan lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,Of course.
15032,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
15033,lancel lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,It wasn’t my wounds that needed healing.
15034,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,What can I do for you?
15035,lancel lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,You can forgive me.
15036,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
15037,lancel lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,I led you into the darkness.
15038,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,I doubt you’ve ever led anyone anywhere.
15039,lancel lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,"I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine."
15040,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,I don’t know what you’re talking about.
15041,lancel lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.,"I’m a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy… or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father’s soul."

15043,olyvar,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,It looks like Dorne.
15044,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,No it doesn’t.
15045,olyvar,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,It does. That’s the Sunspear bit right there. And that’s where the mountains are. And over here is… Sunsnake? Stonespear?
15046,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,Sandstone.
15047,olyvar,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,"Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there."
15048,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,Fine.
15049,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,It’s Dorne.
15050,olyvar,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.
15051,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,"Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here."
15052,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,We’re late for dinner as it is.
15053,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,You’re very respectful.
15054,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,I’m very hungry.
15055,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,What’s your name?
15056,olyvar,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,"Olyvar, my lady."
15057,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,"I’m afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar."
15058,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
15059,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What’s the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
15060,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,In any event… (throws Loras his clothes) you shouldn’t keep your intended waiting.
15061,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,My intended? Please. Tywin’s dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.
15062,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,Lucky you.
15063,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,Unlucky you.
15064,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,You think I want that woman married to my brother?
15065,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,"If she doesn’t marry me, she doesn’t go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King’s Landing. Which means you’re trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law."
15066,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,Perhaps.
15067,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,Perhaps?
15068,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM,Perhaps?
15069,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,"Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers."
15070,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,"Imp, half-man."
15071,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,There are faster ways to kill yourself.
15072,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,Not for a coward.
15073,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,"You are many things, my friend, but not a coward."
15074,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,You never told me why you set me free.
15075,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,Your brother asked me to.
15076,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,You could have said no.
15077,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
15078,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,"Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You’re not family, you owe me nothing."
15079,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,I didn’t do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
15080,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
15081,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,I don’t believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
15082,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,You’re going to have to find another soldier. I’m done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
15083,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,"You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
15084,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,I’m not well-suited for work.
15085,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,"I think you are. You have your father’s instinct for politics, and you have compassion."
15086,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
15087,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,I never said you were perfect.
15088,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,What is it you want exactly?
15089,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
15090,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,"Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that’s how they became powerful in the first place."
15091,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,"Perhaps. And perhaps we’ve grown so used to horror we assume there’s no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?"
15092,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
15093,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,"No, you won’t. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name."
15094,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,Good luck finding him.
15095,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,"Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio’s palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for."
15096,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS,Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
15097,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_3,When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven’t been behaving themselves.
15098,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,"The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review."
15099,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,Good.
15100,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,They did ask for some concessions.
15101,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,Concessions?
15102,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,"Politics is the art of compromise, your grace."
15103,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,I’m not a politician. I’m a queen.
15104,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,"Forgive me. You’re right, of course. Still, it’s easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones."
15105,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,"I don’t expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery."
15106,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.
15107,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
15108,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,"In the new world that you’ve brought to us, free men would fight free men."
15109,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.
15110,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,No fighting pits.
15111,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
15112,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.
15113,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,If you--
15114,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID,How many times must I say no before you understand?
15115,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM,Whatever he wants from me he’s not going to get it. If he really believes I’m going to reopen the fighting pits…
15116,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM,You should reopen the fighting pits.
15117,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM,What?
15118,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM,"My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before."
15119,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM,Why?
15120,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM,"I was a bad child. I wasn’t big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16."
15121,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM,"You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you’re defending the fighting pits?"
15122,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM,"I’m only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you."
15123,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM,"You’re the queen. Everyone’s too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You’ve made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they’ll attack. Show your strength here, now."
15124,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM,That’s why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
15125,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM,Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You’re not the Mother of Unsullied. You’re the Mother of Dragons.
15126,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM,I don’t want another child’s bones dropped at my feet. No one’s seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he’s flown halfway across the world. I can’t control them anymore.
15127,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM,A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.
15128,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,DRAGON PIT,Viserion? Rhaegal?
15129,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,DRAGON PIT,Easy. Easy. Easy.
15130,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,So here we are.
15131,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,Here we are.
15132,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,"When we first met you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting…"
15133,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,This doesn’t have to be our last meeting.
15134,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,"No, but it will be."
15135,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,You know what Stannis wants?
15136,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I’ll give him this much
15137,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,Shouldn’t a king be bold?
15138,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,"Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he’ll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I’ll never serve him."
15139,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,You told me you weren’t here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.
15140,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,That’s right. But I don’t want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.
15141,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,"You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life’s work uniting them. You didn’t do it for power. You didn’t do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they’re north of the wall. Isn’t their survival more important than your pride?"
15142,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn’t about that.
15143,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,Then bend the knee and save your people.
15144,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that’s all gone.
15145,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won’t go out and rescue them because why? You’re afraid of looking afraid.
15146,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,"Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?"
15147,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,They’ll burn you alive.
15148,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,"Bad way to go. I’ll be honest with you, I don’t want to die. And burnt to death, I don’t want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it’s better than betraying everything I believe."
15149,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,"And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they’ll sing songs about you. “You’d rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there’s no one left to sing."
15150,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,"You’re a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can’t understand why I won’t enlist my people in a foreigner’s war, there’s no point explaining."
15151,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,I think you’re making a terrible mistake.
15152,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,MANCE’S CELL,The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.
15153,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK - NIGHT,"Mance Rayder, you’ve been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy."

15155,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK - NIGHT,This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
15156,melisandre,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK - NIGHT,"Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false."
15157,melisandre,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK - NIGHT,"Free folk, there is only one true king, and his name is Stannis. Here stands the king of lies. Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness."

15174,arya stark,5,42,the house of black and white,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - DAY,"...The Mountain, Meryn Trant."
15175,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,THE VALE - INN,Must be good food if it’s crowded.
15177,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,"Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll."
15178,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,You are becoming an observant young lady.
15179,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,"My mother used to say, ""dark wings, dark words""."
15180,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.
15181,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,So it was good news.?
15182,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,My marriage proposal has been accepted.
15183,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.
15185,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,I'll have some.
15186,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,My lady!
15187,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,What is it?
15188,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,Sansa Stark. (Brienne begins to turn around) Don't look!
15189,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,You sure?
15190,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,"She's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish."
15191,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,Littlefinger?
15192,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,A bunch of knights with him.
15193,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,"10, I think. Too many. My lady, I don't think this is the right--"
15194,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,Ready the horses.
15195,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,We only have one horse.
15196,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,Find more.
15197,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,Do you like the taste?
15198,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?
15199,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,It gives some men courage.
15200,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,Does it give you courage?
15202,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,"Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth."
15203,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,"We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then."
15204,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,"Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new."
15205,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,"Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. (Brienne gets up) You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?"
15206,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,I was.
15207,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.
15208,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,It was after Renly's murder.
15209,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,"Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him."
15210,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,I tried to save him.
15211,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,But you were accused.
15212,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,By men who didn't see what happened.
15213,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,Then what did happen?
15214,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.
15215,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,A shadow? With a face? (scoffs) This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?
15216,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,Why should you have any say in her affairs?
15217,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,"Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved’s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."
15218,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,"Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--"
15219,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,No.
15220,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,"Please, my lady. If I could explain--"
15221,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.
15222,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.
15223,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,And sometimes we do. You should leave.
15224,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's,We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?
15227,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,VALE - WOODS,Podrick! (Podrick screams as he loses control of the horse)
15228,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,VALE - WOODS,"Stop, stop, stop! (Horse stops) That’s a good boy."
15229,knight,5,42,the house of black and white,VALE - WOODS,I guess that means you’re unarmed.
15230,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,VALE - WOODS,"Down, Podrick, down!"
15231,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,VALE - WOODS,Podrick?
15232,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,VALE - WOODS,"Yes, my lady?"
15233,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,VALE - WOODS,You can stand now.
15234,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,VALE - WOODS,"Yes, my lady. (stands) Sansa Stark?"
15235,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,VALE - WOODS,"Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We’ll follow them."
15236,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,VALE - WOODS,"My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you’re released from your vow."
15237,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,VALE - WOODS,I swore to their mother I’d protect those girls.
15238,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,VALE - WOODS,If they don’t want your protection--
15239,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,VALE - WOODS,Do you think she’s safe from Littlefinger?
15240,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,VALE - WOODS,"(pause) No, my lady."
15241,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,A summons from the queen.
15242,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,There are only two like it in the world
15243,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,It’s a threat.
15244,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,"Of course it’s a threat! Our daughter’s in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. (mocking) ""It's a threat."""
15245,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,No note.
15246,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,"They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that’s befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!"
15247,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,Softer.
15248,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,What?
15249,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,Not so loud.
15250,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,"Our daughter’s in danger, and you’re worried I’m speaking too loudly!"
15251,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,The world can't know knows she’s our daughter.
15252,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,Then don’t call her your daughter. You’ve never been a father to her.
15253,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,"If I was the father to any of my children, they’d be stoned in the streets."
15254,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.
15255,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,I’ll make things better.
15256,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,You never made anything better.
15257,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,I’m going to Dorne. I’ll bring our daughter home.
15258,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,You can’t just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She’s promised his son.
15259,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,I’m not going to ask him anything.
15260,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,"You go there with an army, it’s an act of war."
15261,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,No army. Do you know where they’re keeping her?
15262,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
15263,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,"I’ll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?"
15264,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - CERSEI'S ROOM,(scoffs) You’re going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?
15265,lollys stokeworth,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,"No sunflowers. I don't like yellow. Roses are very nice, definitely roses. And music. I adore music. But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?"
15266,lollys stokeworth,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,Don't they?
15267,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,Don't who?
15268,lollys stokeworth,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,People eat pigeon pie in the capital.
15269,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,"They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do."
15270,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,"It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this."
15271,lollys stokeworth,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,You won't.
15272,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,Pardon?
15273,lollys stokeworth,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,"We won't get to live at Stokeworth. When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older."
15274,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,Oh.
15275,lollys stokeworth,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,"She hates me. She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isn't looking."
15276,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.
15277,lollys stokeworth,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,She is.
15278,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,"I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another."
15279,lollys stokeworth,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,Who's that?
15280,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,Jaime fucking Lannister.

15283,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,I was very sorry to hear about your father.
15284,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,Thank you.
15285,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,"This is my betrothed, Lollys."
15286,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,A pleasure. (he kisses her hand)
15287,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,"Run along, love."

15291,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.
15292,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,It's very good for you.
15293,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.
15294,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,Mmm.
15295,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,"We made a deal, your sister and I."
15296,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,I would have advised against that.
15297,bronn,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,How is this good for me?
15298,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,"'Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle."

15300,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE,As far south as south goes.

15304,doran martell,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,Captain. Let her pass.
15305,ellaria sand,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,"Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing."
15306,doran martell,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,"Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat. By law, that is not murder."
15307,ellaria sand,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,Your brother--
15308,doran martell,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.
15309,ellaria sand,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,What will you do about his death.
15310,doran martell,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,I will bury him. I will mourn for him.
15311,ellaria sand,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,You would have me go to war?
15312,doran martell,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,You would have me go to war?
15313,ellaria sand,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,The whole country would have you go to war.
15314,doran martell,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.
15315,ellaria sand,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.
15316,ellaria sand,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,"Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?"
15317,doran martell,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.
15318,ellaria sand,5,42,the house of black and white,DORNE - WATER GARDENS,And how long will that be?
15319,daario naharis,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - STREET,The Unsullied are too conspicuous.
15320,daario naharis,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - STREET,"Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?"
15321,daario naharis,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - STREET,"My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it..."
15322,grey worm,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - STREET,No one here. We go.
15323,daario naharis,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - STREET,In a hurry? You're afraid?
15324,grey worm,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - STREET,Unsullied fear nothing.
15325,daario naharis,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - STREET,"Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide."
15326,daario naharis,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - STREET,Fear is useful that way.
15327,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,"Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him."
15328,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,It would send a message.
15329,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,"I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace."
15330,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,Why?
15331,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,"For one thing, he may have valuable information."
15332,daario naharis,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
15333,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,How do you know that?
15334,daario naharis,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,Because I questioned him.
15335,hizdahr zo loraq,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,"And the information you did get, he is young and poor."
15336,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,He is born free.
15337,hizdahr zo loraq,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
15338,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
15339,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.
15340,hizdahr zo loraq,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,And how do you know this?
15341,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,Everyone knows this.
15342,hizdahr zo loraq,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,"I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family."
15343,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,"We do not know what this man did or didn't do. (to Daenerys) Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way."
15344,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,"I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial"
15345,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,Thank you all for your counsel.
15346,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,"Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you."
15347,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,About what?
15348,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,About your father. About the Mad King.
15349,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
15350,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,"Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first.  Your enemies did not lie."
15351,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,Go on.
15352,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,"When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two."
15353,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,I'm not my father.
15354,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,"No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end."
15355,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PYRAMID,I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.
15356,tyrion lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,There's a bug.
15357,varys,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,"Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food."
15358,tyrion lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,"When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? (finishes his cup of wine) Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?"
15359,varys,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,You don't like it?
15360,tyrion lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,I want to take a walk.
15361,varys,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
15362,tyrion lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,"She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
15363,varys,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
15364,tyrion lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,You're right. No point. (realizing) The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
15365,varys,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,The road to Meereen.
15366,tyrion lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
15367,varys,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,I told you. A ruler.
15368,tyrion lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
15369,varys,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,"You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand."
15370,tyrion lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,I didn't rule. I was a servant.
15371,varys,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,"Still, a man of talent."
15372,tyrion lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,Managed to kill a lot of people.
15373,varys,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,"Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well."
15374,tyrion lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.
15375,varys,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,Why?
15376,tyrion lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,'Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant. (takes a drink of wine)
15377,varys,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
15378,tyrion lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,I find us repulsive.
15379,varys,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,"And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long."
15380,tyrion lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,You're right. Let's go for a walk.
15381,varys,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,No.
15382,tyrion lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE,How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
15383,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - QYBURN'S ROOM,Not him.
15384,meryn trant,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - QYBURN'S ROOM,"Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?"
15385,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - QYBURN'S ROOM,"That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made."
15387,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - QYBURN'S ROOM,Take the head.
15388,qyburn,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - QYBURN'S ROOM,"Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work."
15389,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - QYBURN'S ROOM,Very good.
15390,qyburn,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - QYBURN'S ROOM,Over there will be fine.
15391,meryn trant,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - QYBURN'S ROOM,You heard the man. Over there.
15392,kevan lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,You're the Hand of the King?
15393,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,"No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."
15394,mace tyrell,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,"Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--"
15395,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,"You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin."
15396,mace tyrell,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,"Oh, Your Grace."
15397,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
15398,mace tyrell,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,"The honor is all mine, Your Grace."
15399,pycelle,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,"Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand."
15400,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
15401,pycelle,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,"Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?"
15402,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,"The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have."
15403,pycelle,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,I must say I cannot see--
15404,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,"Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title."
15405,kevan lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.
15406,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,The king is very busy at this moment.
15407,kevan lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,"He should be here, learning what it means to rule."
15408,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,"He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf."
15409,kevan lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. (looks to Qyburn) Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
15410,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
15411,kevan lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,What mission?
15412,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,That is not your concern as Master of War.
15413,kevan lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.
15414,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,You would abandon your king in his time of need?
15415,kevan lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP,"If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock."
15416,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,Come on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.
15417,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!
15418,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,"Right, very good!"
15419,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,"Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?"
15420,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,"I know ""S""."
15421,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,"You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things."
15422,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,"Well, you're a wonderful teacher. (to Sam) Very patient!"
15423,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,"I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read."
15424,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.
15425,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,How old were you when you learned to read?
15426,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,Three.
15427,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,"Three?! Who taught you, your mother?"
15428,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because... (trails off)
15429,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,"What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?"
15430,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?
15431,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?
15432,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,"I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?"
15433,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.
15434,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,Did you ever see them?
15435,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,"Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope."
15436,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,What did he do to them in the woods?
15437,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,Mother.
15438,selyse baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,Leave us.
15439,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,Your Grace.
15440,selyse baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,You need to stay away from that girl.
15441,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,Why?
15442,selyse baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,She's a wildling.
15443,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.
15444,selyse baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.
15445,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,Gilly wouldn't do that.
15446,selyse baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY,You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.
15447,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,"I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you."
15448,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,"With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive."
15449,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,Who then? You?
15450,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,No. Only one of their own.
15451,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?
15452,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,The Lord Commander's niece.
15453,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,"Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response."
15454,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,"""Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."" (Jon smiles)"
15455,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,That amuses you?
15456,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,"I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own."
15457,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.
15458,davos seaworth,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,"Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win."
15459,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,Most likely.
15460,davos seaworth,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?
15461,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,"Unpleasant, I expect."
15462,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.
15463,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,"I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you."
15464,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,You can give me the North.
15465,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,"I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow."
15466,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM,"Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell."
15467,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
15468,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,"It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again."
15469,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.
15470,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,I'm going to refuse him.
15471,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
15472,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,"I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?"
15473,alliser thorne,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.
15474,aemon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?
15475,janos slynt,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,"Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings."
15477,janos slynt,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. He's the only true choice.
15478,aemon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,Is there anyone else?
15479,shadow tower brother,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,"Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better."
15480,aemon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,"If there's no one else, we will begin the voting. The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne. The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. Each brother will--"
15481,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,Maester Aemon.
15482,aemon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,Samwell Tarly. Go on.
15483,janos slynt,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,Sam the Slayer.
15484,janos slynt,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer?
15485,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.
15486,janos slynt,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,Lies!
15487,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,"A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making."
15488,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,"Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading."
15489,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,"Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. (a man next to Sam nods) He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest."
15490,alliser thorne,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,"I can't argue with any of that. (stands up) But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?"
15491,aemon,5,42,the house of black and white,CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL,It is time.
15497,arya stark,5,42,the house of black and white,BRAAVOS - STREETS,Turn around and go. (pulls out Needle) Turn around and go.
15499,arya stark,5,42,the house of black and white,BRAAVOS - STREETS,Nothing's worth anything to dead men.
15501,arya stark,5,42,the house of black and white,BRAAVOS - THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Who are you? Why were they scared of you?
15503,arya stark,5,42,the house of black and white,BRAAVOS - THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
15504,jaqen h'ghar,5,42,the house of black and white,BRAAVOS - THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.
15505,arya stark,5,42,the house of black and white,BRAAVOS - THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Well who are you then?
15506,jaqen h'ghar,5,42,the house of black and white,BRAAVOS - THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,No one. And that is who a girl must become.
15507,harpy,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PRISON,"She doesn't belong here. And no matter how many of your traitors call her ""Mhysa"", she will never be your mother."
15508,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PALACE,Why?
15509,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PALACE,"For you, Mhysa. (kneels) You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied. I set you free, as you did all of us."
15510,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PALACE,"He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right."
15511,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PALACE,He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt.
15512,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PALACE,There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.
15513,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PALACE,"Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? (beat) When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting. If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived."
15514,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PALACE,"The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--"
15515,mosador,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PALACE,--and now you are the law!
15516,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - PALACE,The law is the law. Take him.
15518,hizdahr zo loraq,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - DAY,She should have cut off the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.
15519,daario naharis,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - DAY,Which is what I keep telling her to do to you.
15520,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - DAY,You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other.
15522,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - DAY,"Mhysa, please! Forgive me!"
15523,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - DAY,A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death.
15525,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - DAY,Mhysa... (prays in Valyrian)
15527,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_1,"I'll stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace."
15528,grey worm,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_1,We all guard tonight.
15529,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_1,Leave me.
15530,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_1,Drogon...
15532,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,Valar dohaeris.
15533,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,I've been sweeping this floor for days.
15534,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,Good.
15535,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,I didn't come here to sweep floors.
15536,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,"No? Why come, then?"
15537,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.
15538,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,"A man teaches a girl. (Stands up). Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. (Walks away)."
15539,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,I want to serve. (Jaqen stops).
15540,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,"A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one."
15541,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.
15542,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.
15543,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,Where are they taking him?
15546,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,Did I hurt you?
15547,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,No. You were lovely.
15548,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,It all happened so fast.
15549,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,Yes. (Chuckles).
15550,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,"I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded"
15551,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,"No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived."
15552,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,"This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life."
15553,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,"Wouldn't that be glorious? (They laugh. Tommen leans in to kiss her). Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?"
15554,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
15555,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,"No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name."
15556,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
15557,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,So strange… Husband.
15558,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,"Wife. (They laugh). Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, (She chuckles), and it's all because my brother died."
15559,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,"I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty."
15560,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.
15561,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,Do you like to sail?
15562,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,(Sits up). I love to sail.
15563,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,"I do, too."
15564,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,"I think we're going to be very happy, you and I."
15565,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,"I do, too."
15566,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,"Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?"
15567,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
15568,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. (Pours them some wine).
15569,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,"Well, but I'm a man now."
15570,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,You are. And the king. (Hands him win). But you'll always be her baby-boy.
15571,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,I suppose.
15572,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT,"I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. (Sits down and begins to comb her hair). Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight."
15573,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE WALL,"You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters."
15574,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE WALL,Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
15575,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE WALL,There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
15576,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE WALL,That's where you grew up. (They stop). You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
15577,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE WALL,(Chuckles). Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
15578,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE WALL,"The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home."
15579,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE WALL,This is my real home now. Where my family lives.
15580,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE WALL,"I want you to be happy, mother."
15581,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE WALL,"I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy."
15582,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE WALL,But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?
15583,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,"I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"" (Laugher). And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."""
15584,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,Mother! (Gets up and hugs Cersei). Welcome.
15585,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.
15586,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.
15587,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,"No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you."
15588,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,You are very sweet.
15589,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
15590,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.
15591,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
15592,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,"Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. (Margaery’s friends laugh)."
15593,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,I'll leave you to it then. (Turns to leave).
15594,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,"Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?"
15595,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,There's no need for such formalities.
15596,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,"In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon."
15597,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,Won’t that be a lovely day.
15598,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.
15599,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,ROOM,Remember. Anything you need.
15600,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL,We can't hold the North with terror alone.
15601,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL,You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.
15602,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL,"I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies."
15603,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL,"Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot."
15604,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL,He left you no choice.
15605,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL,"I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch."
15606,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL,And?
15607,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL,The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
15608,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL,(After a moment). I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.
15609,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL,We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?
15610,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL,Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
15611,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL,"I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. (Stands up). Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North."
15612,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,That's Moat Cailin.
15613,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,"Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before."
15614,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,"On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?"
15615,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,Home.
15616,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,"The Boltons have Winterfell. (He nods). The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?"
15617,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,(Shakes his head). No.
15618,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!
15619,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,He did.
15620,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,He serves the Lannisters.
15621,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,For now.
15622,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,I won't go.
15623,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,Winterfell is your home.
15624,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,Not anymore.
15625,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.
15626,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.
15627,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,"You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -"
15628,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,No!
15629,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,Sansa -
15630,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,"No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there."
15631,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,"(Grabbing her). I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. (Quietly). You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them."
15632,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,How do we get through there?
15633,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,We don't. We go around. (She turns her horse and begins leaving).
15634,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.
15635,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,NEARBY HILLS,Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.
15636,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
15637,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,He hates that nickname.
15638,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,"Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?"
15639,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,"I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham."
15640,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,He borrowed it?
15641,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,"He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son."
15642,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,As punishment. For both of you.
15643,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
15644,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,"(Walks away to get firewood). Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person."
15645,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
15646,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
15647,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
15648,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,"You want to be a knight, Pod?"
15649,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,Yes.
15650,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,"Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. (Sits down). And I'm going to show you how to ride properly."
15651,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,Thank you.
15652,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,"I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight."
15653,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,I suppose that's more important.
15654,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,"You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?"
15655,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,I was.
15656,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
15657,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,He was.
15658,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,But how did you end up serving Renly?
15659,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,"(After a few moments). When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. (Pauses). And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. (Smiles). My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. (Her smile drops). Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty’, they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They’re nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all."
15660,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
15661,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,"Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly."
15662,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
15663,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,CAMPSITE,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed."
15664,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,Lord Commander.
15665,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,(Stands up). Your Grace.
15666,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,(To Olly as he closes the door). I'd like to speak alone.
15667,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,"Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command."
15668,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,Very well. (They all sit down). Have you considered my offer?
15669,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
15670,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,Say the word and you will be.
15671,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
15672,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
15673,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,"I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
15674,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
15675,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,I can imagine no higher praise.
15676,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,"I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. (Stands up). But if your mind’s made up, I won't try to persuade you."
15677,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,"May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?"
15678,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,Are you bored of us already?
15679,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
15680,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
15681,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,And the wildlings?
15682,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,"They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. (After a moment). Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead."
15683,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,"Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. (Olly stares at him)."
15684,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.
15685,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of  Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
15686,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
15687,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.
15688,davos seaworth,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,"He sees something in you. (Jon looks up). Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you."
15689,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,I'm sorry I disappointed him.
15690,davos seaworth,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
15691,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,As long as he's ruling them.
15692,davos seaworth,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
15693,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,I’ve sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
15694,davos seaworth,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,Have you now? (Turning to Olly). How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.
15695,olly,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,Night gathers and now my watch begins -
15696,davos seaworth,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,"Not that bit, the bit at the end."
15697,olly,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,"I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -"
15698,davos seaworth,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,"Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing."
15699,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,And what needs to be done?
15700,davos seaworth,5,43,high sparrow,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM,"As long as the Boltons rule the North, (Stands up), the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion."
15701,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,What do you want?
15702,waif,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,Who are you?
15703,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,What?
15704,waif,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,"You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. (Stops and walks to Arya). Who are you?"
15705,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,"(After a moment, perks up). No one."
15706,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,Ow! Cunt!
15707,waif,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,"A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?"
15708,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,"I told you, I'm no - (Gets hit again). Do that again and -"
15709,waif,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,Who are you?
15710,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,You're about to find out.
15711,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,What are you doing?
15712,waif,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,We were only playing. The game of faces.
15713,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,A girl is not ready.
15714,waif,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,Clearly not.
15715,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,(Stands up). I am ready.
15716,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.
15717,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,ARYA’S ROOM,"Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?"
15718,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,What do we do with them after we wash them?
15720,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,COURTYARD_1,"Lady Sansa, welcome."
15721,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,COURTYARD_1,(Smiles). Lord Bolton.
15722,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,COURTYARD_1,"May I introduce my son, (Stands aside), Ramsay Bolton?"
15723,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,COURTYARD_1,"It's an honor to meet you, my Lady."
15725,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,HALLWAY_3,Thank you.
15727,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,Sam. (Sam looks up. Jon looks at Maester Aemon’s chair). Maester Aemon?
15728,sam,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.
15729,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,"Take good care of him. (To the group). Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. (Laughter. Jon looks at Alliser). First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. (Laughter. After a moment, he continues). Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger."
15730,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,"Ser Alliser. (Silence). You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger."
15731,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
15732,janos slynt,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,(Scoffs). Greyguard is a ruin.
15733,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,"Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -"
15734,janos slynt,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.
15735,sam,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,"Alright, alright! Enough of that."
15736,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,"You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard."
15737,janos slynt,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,"(Stands up, angrily shouts). I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!"
15738,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,Are you refusing to obey my order?
15739,janos slynt,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,You can stick your order up your bastard arse.
15740,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,Take Lord Janos outside.
15741,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,"Olly, bring me my sword."
15742,janos slynt,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,"You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! (Everyone moves outside). Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken."
15743,janos slynt,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,"A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!"
15744,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,"If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time."
15745,janos slynt,5,43,high sparrow,DINING HALL_1,"(Trembling). I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! (Jon brings his sword up). My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid."
15746,olyvar,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_4,"You have served us well, my son."
15747,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_4,"Thank you, Father."
15748,olyvar,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_4,Which of the Seven will you worship today?
15749,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_4,The Maiden.
15750,olyvar,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_4,Where is the Maiden?
15751,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_4,And the Stranger.
15752,olyvar,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_4,"(Leaning forward). Two is extra, you realize?"
15753,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_4,"Yes, yes."
15754,olyvar,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_4,What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't -
15755,lancel lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_4,You have profaned our faith. The faith of our fathers and forefathers.
15756,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_4,I am the High Septon of the -
15757,lancel lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_4,(Grabs his neck). You are a sinner. And you shall be punished.
15763,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_2,"(To Cersei) Your Grace, (To Pycelle), Grandmaester, (To Mace) Lord Tyrell, (To Qyburn), uh…"
15764,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_2,It doesn't matter. (Mace sits down).
15765,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_2,"As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion."
15766,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_2,You were assaulted?
15767,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_2,"I was, by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows’. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive."
15768,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_2,I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.
15769,mace tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_2,"High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear."
15770,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_2,"I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother."
15771,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_2,So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?
15772,pycelle,5,43,high sparrow,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_2,A man's private affairs ought to stay private!
15773,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_2,"What do you want from us, High Septon?"
15774,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_2,"Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -"
15775,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_2,And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?
15776,meryn trant,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,"I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace."
15777,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,"Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. (To a man at the bottom of some stairs). Where can I find the High Sparrow?"
15782,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?
15783,high sparrow,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,"High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. (Laughs). So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. (Prepares soup for the next person in line). The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me."
15785,high sparrow,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,"Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. (Prepares soup for the next person in line)."
15786,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,Why no shoes?
15787,high sparrow,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
15788,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?
15789,high sparrow,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,"Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so."
15790,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,(Smiles). Perhaps they're right.
15791,high sparrow,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,"It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon."
15792,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,"An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?"
15793,high sparrow,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,"Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade."
15794,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,"The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you."
15795,high sparrow,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.
15796,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,STREET_2,"(After a moment). My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. (The High Sparrow looks up at her surprised). The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another."
15797,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,QYBURN’S LAB,Your Grace.
15798,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,QYBURN’S LAB,"Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. (Hands him the letter)."
15799,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,QYBURN’S LAB,"At once, Your Grace. (Walks to his desk)."
15800,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,QYBURN’S LAB,How's your work coming along?
15801,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,QYBURN’S LAB,Very well.
15802,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,QYBURN’S LAB,You've made progress?
15803,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,QYBURN’S LAB,"More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but…"
15804,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,QYBURN’S LAB,"Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediately""."
15805,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,QYBURN’S LAB,"Shh. Easy, friend."
15806,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.
15807,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She’s suffered enough.
15808,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,I'll never hurt her. You have my word.
15809,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,"I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go."
15810,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.
15811,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,(Approaching). And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.
15812,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,"Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. (Bows)."
15813,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,He seems pleased.
15814,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,Shouldn't he be?
15815,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,"(They begin walking). I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must."
15816,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,"I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue."
15817,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,Then I have delivered everything I've promised.
15818,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.
15819,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,"The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear."
15820,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,The Queen will be enraged.
15821,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,"Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day."
15822,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,"And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. (They stop, and Roose holds up a letter). A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale."
15823,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,"A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken."
15824,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,"I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?"
15825,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
15826,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?
15827,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,"The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply."
15828,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_14,I'd like to read the reply.
15829,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
15830,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,Volantis is a large city.
15831,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
15832,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.
15833,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,"Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse."
15834,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.
15835,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,(Walks over to him). I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
15836,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,It's a perfectly good face.
15837,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,I'm losing my mind.
15838,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,"If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that."
15839,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,"Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. (Pulls his hood up). What am I? (Varys shakes his head). One more drunk dwarf."
15840,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,Slaves.
15841,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. (Shot of a man with a fly tattooed onto his cheek). Flies for dung shovelers. (Shot of a man with a hammer tattooed onto his cheek). Hammers for builders. (Shot of a man inspecting women with tears tattooed onto their cheeks). Tears for whores. Lest they forget.
15845,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,(Aside) We should keep moving.
15849,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.
15851,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. (Varys shushes him worriedly).
15853,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?
15854,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,(Covering his face). Come on. Let's find a brothel.
15856,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE,It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.
15857,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,"See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust."
15858,varys,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,Thank you.
15859,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,Curious... hair. (She looks at him).
15861,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.
15862,varys,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.
15866,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,"Well, (Watches her kiss the man), she's taken."
15867,varys,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,Where're you going?
15868,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,I need to speak to someone with hair.
15869,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,Hello?
15870,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,Hello.
15871,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,You've got no drink.
15872,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,You've got no money.
15873,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,"Do I look like a man without money? (She looks at him incredulously). Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. (She laughs). But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? (Sits down). I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it."
15874,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.
15875,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,That’s because they’ve never met a queen.
15876,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,You're just saying that.
15877,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,"You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you."
15878,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,Why?
15879,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,Because you have a skeptical mind.
15880,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,"(Smiles). Alright, then. I'm warning you. We’re gonna have to wash you first."
15881,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,Come on.
15882,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,"(After a moment). I'm, I'm sorry, I can't."
15883,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,Of course you can. You're shy.
15884,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,I'm not.
15885,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,Have another drink.
15886,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,BROTHEL_5,"Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I’ll go for a piss, that’s a start."
15887,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,/EXT. WINDOW,"No need to worry, I was just - (Turns to see it’s not Varys, but Jorah). Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige."
15888,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,/EXT. WINDOW,You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -
15889,jorah mormont,5,43,high sparrow,/EXT. WINDOW,I'm taking you to the Queen.
15890,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT,Is that Estermont?
15892,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?
15893,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,"This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night."
15894,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,You ever been to Dorne?
15895,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,No.
15896,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.
15897,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,You should be happy to go back. (Drinks some water).
15898,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,"(Gets up, walking to his knife). There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. (Pulls out his knife from the sandbag). And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess."
15899,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,"We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,"
15900,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,(Incredulously) Your niece?
15901,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. (Sits down).
15902,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,That's why you're here.
15903,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,"I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one."
15904,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,Because I don't want to start a war.
15905,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.
15906,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,It has to be me.
15907,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,"(Gets up starts walking). If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, (Grabs some rope and walks back), who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -"
15908,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,It has to be me.
15909,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,"(Sheaths his sword). You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that."
15910,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,(Quietly) Varys set him free.
15911,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,"Well, if you ever see the little fucker, (Lays down), give him my regards."
15912,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,BELOW DECK,"He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards."
15913,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown's debts. Given the expense of rebuilding the royal -
15914,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,How much can the Crown afford?
15915,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,"With winter coming, half what they ask. Less."
15916,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?
15917,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,"Well, House Tyrell could front the gold, and the the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter."
15918,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,"You've already given us too much. (Gets up and walks to a window). No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank."
15919,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,Absolutely.
15920,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,In person.
15921,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,"(After a moment, looks at her surprised). Me? (Qyburn smiles)."
15922,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,"We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified."
15923,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,"I will be honored, Your Grace."
15924,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. (Smiling). He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.
15925,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,My very own Kingsguard? Please express -
15926,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,"Safe travels, Lord Tyrell."
15927,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,"(Raises his hands). Of course, of course, (Gathers his belongings, and then gets up). I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos."
15928,pycelle,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.
15929,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_3,(Walking out). Not small enough.
15930,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,"May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?"
15931,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,No. (Smiles).
15932,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. (Smiles).
15933,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,"I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure. But the truth is, (Chuckles), I don't like the taste."
15934,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,Hmm.
15935,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,(After a moment). How may I serve?
15936,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.
15937,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,"Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods."
15938,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,"Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. (HS raises an eyebrow). In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven."
15939,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,"Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago."
15940,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,"If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy."
15941,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.
15942,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,"An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven."
15943,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,"An honor I never expected. Or indeed, ever wished for."
15944,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,"Which is why you were chosen. (HS smiles). You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most."
15945,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,All sinners are equal before the Gods.
15946,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,(Smiles. Continues after a moment). What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.
15947,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER,May the Father judge him justly. (Smiles).
15949,olyvar,5,44,sons of the harpy,BROTHEL_6,(Angrily). This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.
15954,loras tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,STAIRWELL,Get your hands off of me.
15955,lancel lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,STAIRWELL,"Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of Gods and men."
15956,loras tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,STAIRWELL,Who do you think you are?
15957,lancel lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,STAIRWELL,Justice. (Loras grunts and struggles).
15958,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,HALLWAY_4,Why is my brother in a cell?
15959,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,HALLWAY_4,"I, I don't know. I, I didn't order it."
15960,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,HALLWAY_4,We both know who did. (Walks away). You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.
15961,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,HALLWAY_4,(Standing up). Are you saying my mother is behind this?
15962,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,HALLWAY_4,She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.
15963,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,HALLWAY_4,Aren't you and mother getting along?
15964,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,HALLWAY_4,"(Scoffs). Oh, my sweet, sweet King. (Sits down). Do you have any affection for me at all?"
15965,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,HALLWAY_4,(Takes her hand). Of course I do. You're my Queen.
15966,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,HALLWAY_4,I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.
15967,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,HALLWAY_4,I'll set him free for you.
15968,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,HALLWAY_4,Do you promise?
15969,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,CERSEI’S CHAMBERS,I demand that Ser Loras be freed now!
15970,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,CERSEI’S CHAMBERS,(Turns around). Did I arrest him?
15971,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,CERSEI’S CHAMBERS,"Well, no... But you armed the Faith Militant. You gave the High Sparrow an army."
15972,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,CERSEI’S CHAMBERS,"I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. (Begins walking towards her desk). Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions."
15973,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,CERSEI’S CHAMBERS,Then can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?
15974,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,CERSEI’S CHAMBERS,"I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy."
15978,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE GREAT SEPT,"You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?"
15984,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE GREAT SEPT,We'll find another way.
15986,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS,My Queen?
15987,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS,There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.
15988,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS,"You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm. And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law."
15989,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS,I'm going to speak to the High Sparrow.
15990,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS,Are you? When?
15991,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS,I--I don't know.
15992,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS,You don't know?
15993,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS,He was praying just now.
15994,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS,(Walking out). I have to send word to Grandmother.
15995,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS,Will you come back later? (Margaery stops).
15996,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS,"I need to be with my family, Your Grace. (Continues walking)."
15997,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS,Of course.
15998,selyse baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,You think highly of this boy.
15999,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,(To some of the men sparring). Good.
16000,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
16001,selyse baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,A bastard by some tavern slut.
16002,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,"Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way."
16003,selyse baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,I should have given you a son.
16004,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,Not your fault.
16005,selyse baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,Whose then? (Looks at their daughter Shireen). I gave you nothing but weakness. (Turns back). And deformity. (Stannis shakes his head).
16006,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,(Walking towards them). Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.
16007,selyse baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,My Lady.
16008,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,Her father is the Lord's chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins.
16009,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,You march on Winterfell soon?
16010,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,We must. To beat the snows.
16011,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again.
16012,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,I won't. I need you.
16013,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,"You only need faith, my King."
16014,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,"(Walking away). And you, my Lady, what do you need?"
16015,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,CASTLE BLACK_8,To serve my Lord.
16016,sam,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,Lord Ashford. (Jon signs). Lady Caulfield. (Jon signs). Lord Smallwood.
16017,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,Never even heard of these people.
16018,sam,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,They haven't heard of you either. (Jon signs). But we need men and they have some.
16019,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?
16020,sam,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,"(Chuckles, looking at the next letter). More than Lord Wibberley."
16021,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,Not him.
16022,sam,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,"I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North."
16023,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,He murdered my brother.
16024,sam,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.
16025,sam,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,"Apologies, my Lady."
16026,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,Lord Commander.
16027,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,How can I help you?
16028,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,"Come with us when we ride south. (Walks forwards). None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? (Turns to Jon)."
16029,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
16030,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. (Walks in front of Jon).
16031,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,"You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions."
16032,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,No visions. No magic. Just life.
16033,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,"Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it."
16034,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,"The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows."
16035,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,I don't think Stannis would like that very much.
16036,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,Then we shouldn't tell him. (Starts unbuttoning Jon’s coat).
16037,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,I can't.
16038,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,Why?
16039,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,I swore a vow. (Melisandre looks at him incredulously). I loved another.
16040,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.
16041,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,I know. But I still love her.
16042,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,JON’S CHAMBER,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
16043,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,STANNIS’S ROOM,Are you lonely?
16044,shireen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,STANNIS’S ROOM,"(Turns around, holding something). Just bored."
16045,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,STANNIS’S ROOM,My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.
16046,shireen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,STANNIS’S ROOM,"(Looks up). Were you bored a lot, too?"
16047,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,STANNIS’S ROOM,"I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -"
16048,shireen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,STANNIS’S ROOM,I like it. (Walks to a table). I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. (Picks up an X from the table).
16049,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,STANNIS’S ROOM,Why do you say that?
16050,shireen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,STANNIS’S ROOM,"She told me, ""I don't want to bring you."""
16051,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,STANNIS’S ROOM,She shouldn't have said that.
16052,shireen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,STANNIS’S ROOM,"Are you ashamed of me, father?"
16053,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,STANNIS’S ROOM,"When you were an infant, (Stands up and walks around his desk), the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, (Shireen smiles), and you pressed it to your cheek. (Looks down. Shireen’s smile drops). By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. (Walks to the table and adjusts the objects on it). I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. (Turns to her). Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. (Shireen smiles). I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. (Walks towards her). You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter."
16054,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,I thought I might find you here. (Sansa turns to him). Your Aunt Lyanna.
16055,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,"Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful."
16056,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,"I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?"
16057,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,"Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her."
16058,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,Come. (Takes her arm). Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. (They begin walking away).
16059,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,Dressed for riding?
16060,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,I am.
16061,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,Where are you going?
16062,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,King's Landing.
16063,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,King's Landing?
16064,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,Cersei sent for me. (They stop). We must not let her sniff out any trouble.
16065,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,You can't leave me here!
16066,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,"I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long."
16067,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,How do you know?
16068,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,"(They begin walking again). Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell."
16069,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,You don't know that.
16070,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,"I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne."
16071,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,You think he'll defeat the Boltons?
16072,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,"He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. (They stop). As it happens, I am a betting man."
16073,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,And if you're right?
16074,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,"Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North."
16075,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,"But I, I wouldn't… Wardeness of the North"
16076,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.
16077,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,"What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?"
16078,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,"Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours."
16079,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,I don't know how to do that.
16080,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.
16081,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,His father frightens me.
16082,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,"He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you’ve learnt to maneuver from the very best. (Puts a hand on her shoulder). I return before too long. (Puts a hand behind her head). You'll be strong without me. (She nods, and he kisses her). The North will be yours. Do you believe me?"
16083,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL,I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.
16084,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,Breakfast.
16085,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,That would have been a shit way to die.
16086,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,"As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die."
16087,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.
16088,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
16089,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,"No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me."
16090,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,Sounds like all the rest.
16091,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,What about you? What shit way would you choose?
16092,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,"In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune."
16093,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
16094,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?
16095,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,In the arms of the woman I love.
16096,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,She want the same thing?
16097,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,Let's go.
16098,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,"The captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?"
16099,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,Pentoshi.
16100,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,And he's headed to Oldtown?
16101,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,As I said. Why?
16102,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?
16103,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,A bag of gold.
16104,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
16105,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,It was a heavy bag.
16106,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.
16107,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,How many you count?
16108,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,Four.
16109,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,How many you think you can take?
16110,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,"One, if he's slow."
16112,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,"Fucked in the arse. (Both get up). Hiya! (The riders approach them). Morning, lads. Glad we found you."
16114,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,Cooper. (Points to Jaime). This is Darnell.
16116,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.
16118,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,"Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really."
16119,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,I thought the sharks would get us. (Bronn looks at him).
16121,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,I could have sworn those were shark fins.
16122,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,Dolphins maybe.
16124,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,"Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home."
16126,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,That one should be slow enough.
16127,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,Nice move! (Jaime turns to him).
16128,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,Luck.
16129,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,You had a wonderful teacher.
16130,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.
16131,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,First we need to bury these bodies.
16132,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,Birds have to eat too.
16133,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,"Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war."
16134,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
16135,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING,"(Holding out his hand). I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really."
16136,tyene sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,BEACH_4,Nama!
16137,ellaria sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,BEACH_4,"Nym, Obara."
16138,obara sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,BEACH_4,Will it be war?
16139,ellaria sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,BEACH_4,"Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves."
16140,obara sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,BEACH_4,Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.
16141,ellaria sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,BEACH_4,"We don't need an army to start a war. (Drinks water). Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them."
16142,nymeria,5,44,sons of the harpy,BEACH_4,We may have a problem.
16143,obara sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,BEACH_4,"A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne."
16144,ellaria sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,BEACH_4,"He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war."
16145,tyene sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,BEACH_4,(Walks towards her). I'm with you. Always. (Elaria puts a hand to her face).
16146,ellaria sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,BEACH_4,Nym? (Nymeria nods). Obara?
16147,obara sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,BEACH_4,"When I was a child, (Begins walking), Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl."
16148,obara sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,BEACH_4,(Smiles). I made my choice long ago.
16149,tyrion lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA,Thank you. (After a long pause). Who are you?
16150,jorah mormont,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA,Your captor.
16151,tyrion lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA,Do you have wine?
16152,jorah mormont,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA,No.
16153,tyrion lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA,I can't sleep without wine.
16154,jorah mormont,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA,Then stay awake.
16155,tyrion lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA,You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.
16156,jorah mormont,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA,I'm not taking you to your sister.
16157,tyrion lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA,You said you were taking me to the Queen.
16158,jorah mormont,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA,I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.
16159,tyrion lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA,(Chuckles). What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
16160,jorah mormont,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA,What business would you have with the Queen?
16161,tyrion lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA,"Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? (Holds out his hands expectantly. Jorah makes no move to respond). A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. (Jorah looks downtrodden). And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely."
16162,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,Everyone looks happy enough from up here. (Barristan chuckles). What?
16163,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,"I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing."
16164,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,Why?
16165,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,"He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them."
16166,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,He sang to them?
16167,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.
16168,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,And what did you do?
16169,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. (Daenerys looks surprised). Well he liked to see how much he could make.
16170,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,He was good?
16171,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,He was very good. Viserys never told you?
16172,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. (Sits down).
16173,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.
16174,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,And what did you do with the money?
16175,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,"Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. (They both laugh)."
16176,daario naharis,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,"(Entering). Your Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber."
16177,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,How many others are there?
16178,daario naharis,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,Fifty a hundred.
16179,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,"Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?"
16180,daario naharis,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.
16181,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,"I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me."
16182,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY,Your Grace. (Leaves).
16183,hizdahr zo loraq,5,44,sons of the harpy,AUDIENCE CHAMBER,All men must die. But not all can die in glory.
16184,missandei,5,44,sons of the harpy,AUDIENCE CHAMBER,Glory?
16185,hizdahr zo loraq,5,44,sons of the harpy,AUDIENCE CHAMBER,"Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have."
16186,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,AUDIENCE CHAMBER,Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
16187,hizdahr zo loraq,5,44,sons of the harpy,AUDIENCE CHAMBER,"Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season."
16188,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,AUDIENCE CHAMBER,I do not recognize this tradition.
16189,hizdahr zo loraq,5,44,sons of the harpy,AUDIENCE CHAMBER,"Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. (Shots of Sons of the Harpy walking through tunnels with torches). Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start."

16192,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,THRONE ROOM_5,"""Barristan the Bold"" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks."
16193,daario naharis,5,45,kill the boy,THRONE ROOM_5,"We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide."
16194,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,THRONE ROOM_5,I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.
16195,hizdahr zo loraq,5,45,kill the boy,THRONE ROOM_5,But... I'm the leader of my family.
16196,hizdahr zo loraq,5,45,kill the boy,THRONE ROOM_5,"No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace!"
16197,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,DRAGON CHAMBER,(in Valyrian) Walk forward.

(One of the men is mumbling). But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must."
16201,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,DRAGON CHAMBER,(Valyrian) But she does not give up on them.
16202,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,DRAGON CHAMBER,"(Valyrian) Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, (Looks at Hizdahr), maybe none of you are. Maybe, (Touching Hizdahr’s arm), I should let the dragons decide."

16206,aemon,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY,"And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying."
16207,sam,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY,"Don't say that, Maester Aemon."
16208,aemon,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY,"A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing."

16213,aemon,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY,"Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death."
16214,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY,"I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order."
16215,aemon,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY,"Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it."
16216,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY,But you don't know what it is.
16217,aemon,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY,"That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born."

16220,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,What about you?
16221,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,Hard to lead when you're in chains.
16222,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,What if I unchained you?
16223,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,Why would you do that?
16224,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
16225,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
16226,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,"For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you."

16228,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,It is.
16229,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,Why now?
16230,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,"Because now, (Leans forward), I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."

16232,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,(Stands up). I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
16233,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,They won't kneel for you and neither will I.
16234,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
16235,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.
16236,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,"And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
16237,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,(Stands up). Easy thing to say to a man in chains.
16238,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
16239,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?
16240,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,Up on Storrold's Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
16241,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,We'll need ships.
16242,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
16243,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,ROOM_2,"All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding won’t be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go."

16252,alliser thorne,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_2,We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.
16253,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_2,And we've slaughtered theirs.
16254,eddison tollett,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_2,"I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. (Men mumble in agreement). They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it."
16255,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_2,"You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that."
16256,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM_1,"Thank you. (Olly walks away). Olly. (He stops). If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right."
16257,olly,5,45,kill the boy,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM_1,"You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them."
16258,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM_1,It's not a trick.
16259,olly,5,45,kill the boy,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM_1,"They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew."
16260,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM_1,I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.

16264,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,COURTYARD_2,(Turns around). Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.
16265,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,COURTYARD_2,Thank you. You've lived here a long time?
16267,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,COURTYARD_2,Did you know Lord Eddard?
16269,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,COURTYARD_2,Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.
16271,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,COURTYARD_2,I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.
16273,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,COURTYARD_2,Someone who swore to keep her safe.
16275,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,COURTYARD_2,Her mother.
16277,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,COURTYARD_2,That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?

16279,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS,I saw you staring at her.
16280,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS,I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.
16281,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS,You said you'd marry me.
16282,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS,And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.
16283,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS,Do you think she's pretty?
16284,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS,Of course I do. I'm not blind.
16285,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS,"You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you."

16287,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS,"(Laughs). You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? (She tries to hit him, but he restrains her). You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?"
16288,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS,(Smiles). Never.

16304,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,OUTSIDE_1,"I know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember."

16306,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,DUNGEON ENTRANCE,What is it?
16307,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,DUNGEON ENTRANCE,"That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it."

16331,walda frey,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.
16332,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.
16333,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,"You're right. Very strange. More wine, please."
16334,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,"I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. (Theon begins pouring wine). I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?"
16335,theon greyjoy,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,"(Turns around). Yes, master."
16336,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,"That's his new name, Reek."
16337,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,Why are you doing this?
16338,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,"Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? (He gestures Theon over). An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers."
16339,theon greyjoy,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,"(After a moment, stuttering). I'm sorry."
16340,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,"Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye."
16341,theon greyjoy,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,I'm sorry.
16342,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,Sorry about what?
16343,theon greyjoy,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,For killing your brothers.
16344,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,"There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. (Theon turns to leave). You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?"
16345,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,"Yes, yes, very good."
16346,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_3,Wonderful. (Sips wine).

16352,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,Sure of what?
16353,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?
16354,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.
16355,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,So how did you manage it?
16356,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,Manage what?
16357,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,Getting her pregnant.
16358,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.
16359,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,"Of course, but how did you find it?"
16360,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,"You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl."
16361,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,And if it's a boy?
16362,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,You're worried about your position.
16363,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.
16364,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,You've never asked me about your mother.
16365,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,"Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are."
16366,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,ROOSE’S WAR ROOM,"She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. (Stands up). But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. (After a moment). Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?"

16377,sam,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY_1,"Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound."
16378,gilly,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY_1,I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.
16379,sam,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY_1,Well -
16380,gilly,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY_1,Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
16381,sam,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY_1,It's where they train the maesters.

I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker."
16388,sam,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY_1,"I did, Your Grace."
16389,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY_1,How?
16390,sam,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY_1,With a dagger made of dragonglass.
16391,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY_1,Dragonglass?

16393,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,LIBRARY_1,I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?

16400,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_4,It's time.
16401,davos seaworth,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_4,"Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men."

But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise."
16403,davos seaworth,5,45,kill the boy,DINING HALL_4,I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.

What do you think?"

About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live."

Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip.

16457,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,RIVER SURROUNDED BY WOODS,"And then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end.

16469,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SHORE,I suppose that's why they send them there.

16471,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SHORE,"We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat."

16522,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,SHORE_1,Why?
16523,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,SHORE_1,Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
16524,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,SHORE_1,I’m sure you’ve visited many brothels in many cities.
16525,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,SHORE_1,I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn’t commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.
16526,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,SHORE_1,"As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man."
16527,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,SHORE_1,What do you know about my father?
16528,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,SHORE_1,"I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”"
16529,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,SHORE_1,You didn’t know. I’m sorry. I am.
16530,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,SHORE_1,How?

16532,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,SHORE_1,How?
16533,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,SHORE_1,He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.
16534,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,SHORE_1,We better keep moving.

More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me."
16540,arya stark,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,I’ve devoted my life to him now. You don’t want to hurt anymore. Drink.

16543,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert’s Rebellion."
16544,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Do you believe in anything?
16545,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,I believe in many things.
16546,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?"
16547,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,No.
16548,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I’d find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?"
16549,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,No.
16550,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,It's hard to be a cynic after that.
16551,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen.
16552,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,No it doesn’t.
16553,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?"
16554,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,First we have to conquer the world.
16555,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"We? Alright, let’s assume your dreams come true. She’s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"
16556,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Then she rules.
16557,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That’s justice?
16558,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,She is the rightful heir.
16559,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?"
16560,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Shh! It’s a slave ship
16561,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Why is it anchored?

16563,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,--water.
16564,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"Got a lot of fight in you, huh?"
16565,slaver,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Salt mines.
16566,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.
16567,slaver,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,What about the dwarf?
16568,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Worthless. Cut his throat.
16569,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let’s discuss this!"
16570,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf’s cock has magic powers.
16571,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can’t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?"
16572,slaver,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,It will be a dwarf-sized cock.
16573,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Guess again.
16574,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.
16575,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
16576,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"We’re bound to Volantis, not Slaver’s Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits."
16577,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"The fighting puts in Mereen! You’re in luck then, you’re about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms."
16578,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,(looks at Jorah) Him.
16579,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Him? He’s got to be 60 years old.
16580,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"Sure, he’s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!"
16581,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Is that true?
16582,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself."
16583,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,The Kingslayer!
16584,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Jousting. You’re talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.
16585,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.
16586,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Liar.
16587,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"It’s no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver’s Bay, put a sword in my hand, I’ll prove my worth."
16588,lancel lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - STREETS,Lord Baelish.
16589,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - STREETS,Yes? (Lancel approaches him) Lancel Lannister.
16590,lancel lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - STREETS,Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.
16591,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - STREETS,That’s quite a family to abandon.
16592,lancel lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - STREETS,"The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run."
16593,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - STREETS,Well done.
16594,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - STREETS,I’m here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I’ll be delayed?
16595,lancel lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - STREETS,"Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You’ll find that there’s little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King’s Landing."
16596,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - STREETS,"We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining."
16597,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,"Do you think it’s wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?"
16598,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
16599,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.
16600,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,The King’s orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras’ perversion?
16601,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,House Tyrell won’t tolerate these insults.
16602,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,"House Tyrell won’t tolerate it? I’m the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys."
16603,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,One’s choice of companion is a curious thing.
16604,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you’re still in mourning.
16605,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
16606,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,"She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."
16607,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
16608,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
16609,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
16610,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,Good. (Cersei gets up) If there’s nothing else.
16611,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,"There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn’t trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell."
16612,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,That’s not possible.
16613,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,"My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen."
16614,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
16615,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
16616,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,We were fools to trust a turncloak.
16617,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
16618,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
16619,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,"I would counsel patience, your grace."
16620,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,"Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor."
16621,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,"Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they’re done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."
16622,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,"Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn."
16623,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,"That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force."
16624,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
16625,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,"Ser Jaime, then."
16626,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I’ve no idea when he’ll be back.
16627,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,"Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow."
16628,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,"Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man."
16629,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,"You wouldn’t risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?"
16630,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,And if you succeed?
16631,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,Name me Warden of the North.
16632,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,I’ll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
16633,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,I’ll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
16634,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,And I’ll l know you’re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark’s head on a spike.
16635,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM,As I said. I live to serve.
16636,trystane martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - GARDEN,I’m going to ask him tomorrow.
16637,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - GARDEN,What if he says no?
16638,trystane martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - GARDEN,He won’t. You’ve waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?
16639,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - GARDEN,"Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you…"
16640,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - GARDEN,We can’t. Not yet.
16641,trystane martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - GARDEN,Why not?
16642,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - GARDEN,You know why not. Someone will see.
16643,trystane martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - GARDEN,You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.
16644,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - GARDEN,How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?
16645,trystane martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - GARDEN,I like the way your eyes go squinty when you’re jealous.
16646,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - GARDEN,"They don’t go squinty, and you didnt answer the question."
16647,doran martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Doran and Areo on the balcony.,They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.
16648,areo hotah,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Doran and Areo on the balcony.,"Yes, my prince."
16649,doran martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Doran and Areo on the balcony.,You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.
16650,areo hotah,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Doran and Areo on the balcony.,I remember how.
16651,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE,The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman’s blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman’s wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...
16652,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE,"Alright, thats enough."
16653,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE,I’m coming to the best part.
16654,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE,We’re trying to blend in. We don’t want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
16655,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE,This song really is all about the ending.
16656,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE,It can wait. Up there.
16657,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE,That’s the Water Gardens.
16658,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE,"Once we got the princess, then what?"
16659,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE,I like to improvise.
16660,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE,That explains the golden hand.
16661,ellaria sand,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,SHADOWY ROOM,"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn."
16662,sand snakes,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,SHADOWY ROOM,For Oberyn.
16663,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,"Well, she’s made herself at home."
16664,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,Myrcella.
16665,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,"Uncle Jaime? I don’t understand, what are you doing here?"
16666,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,Let’s speak in private.
16667,trystane martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,I am Trystane Martell.
16668,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,Trystane is my intended.
16669,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,Excellent. Good to meet you.
16670,trystane martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,"We weren’t expecting you, Ser Jaime."
16671,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,"Why don’t you let them have some time alone, son?"
16672,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,Let’s not do something stupid.
16673,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,No!
16674,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,That was something stupid.
16675,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,"We have to go, Myrcella, now."
16676,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,You hurt him!
16677,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,"You’ll be fine, I promise, but we have to--"
16678,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,Oh for fuck’s sake.
16679,obara sand,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,You’re coming with me.
16680,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,I don’t want to!
16681,obara sand,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,"I wasn’t asking, princess."
16682,areo hotah,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,Drop you weapons!
16683,obara sand,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?
16684,areo hotah,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,Drop your weapons!
16685,areo hotah,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,"When you were whole, it would have been a good fight."
16686,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,WATER GARDENS,You fight pretty good for a little girl.
16688,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,inside the carriage.,"Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on."
16689,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - GARDEN,"Rumors and gossip, that’s all they got. It’s theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King’s Landing there’d be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."
16690,margaery tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - GARDEN,Everyone knew about him and Renly.
16691,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - GARDEN,Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
16692,margaery tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - GARDEN,But he was the king’s brother.
16693,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - GARDEN,"And Loras is the queen’s brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable."
16694,margaery tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - GARDEN,Cersei is behind this.
16695,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,KING’S LANDING - GARDEN,"Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister."
16696,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,"Your Grace, I have travelled a long way."
16697,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,You must be exhausted.
16698,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,"Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren’t writing anything."
16699,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,"Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns."
16700,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
16701,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,Beg your pardon.
16702,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,I know you’re behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
16703,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
16704,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,You’ll get your apology when I get Loras.
16705,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
16706,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,"Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
16707,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
16708,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,Do you expect the alliance to continue after you’ve thrown our future into prison?
16709,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,"As I said, i didn’t imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--"
16710,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,What veil?
16711,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
16712,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,I didn’t trust your father. I didn’t particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
16713,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,CERSEI’S ROOM_1,"House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I’m sure they don’t. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we’ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna."
16714,high sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
16715,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,I don’t pay attention to rumors.
16716,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,"You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis’ army closed in"
16717,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,He was my friend. He was my king.
16718,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,"Wasn’t Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly."
16719,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,I was wrong to support Renly’s claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.
16720,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,Wearing Renly’s armor.
16721,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,Why does it matter what I wore?
16722,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,"Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy."
16723,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,Of course I deny them.
16724,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,You never lay with Renly Baratheon.
16725,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,Never.
16726,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,Nor any other man.
16727,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,Never.
16728,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM,That will be all Ser Loras.

16924,gilly,5,47,the gift,CASTLE BLACK - BEDROOM,"Don’t be stupid Sam, you’re not a fighter."
16925,sam,5,47,the gift,CASTLE BLACK - BEDROOM,What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?

16948,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,MEREEN - DAENERYS’ CHAMBER,Don’t be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he’s smart enough to understand that.
16949,daario naharis,5,47,the gift,MEREEN - DAENERYS’ CHAMBER,I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.
16950,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,MEREEN - DAENERYS’ CHAMBER,Are you jealous?
16951,daario naharis,5,47,the gift,MEREEN - DAENERYS’ CHAMBER,Do you think I’m petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?
16952,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,MEREEN - DAENERYS’ CHAMBER,I do.

16976,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,"A man of the people, is that your game? It’s an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei’s dirty work for her."

16988,sparrow,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don’t have one in your library I’ll give you my own.
16989,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,I’ve read the seven pointed star.
16990,sparrow,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,Then you’ll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.
16991,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,"Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?"
16992,sparrow,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,Yes. The Gods’ laws must be applied to all equally.
16993,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,"If it’s equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I’ll make sure the hungry know who to blame,"
16994,sparrow,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,"Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell?

17009,myrcella baratheon,5,47,the gift,DORNE_1,You looked different when I left. You had more hair.

17017,myrcella baratheon,5,47,the gift,DORNE_1,"It’s not complicated at all, it’s simple. I love Trystane, I’m going to marry him, and we’re staying right here."
17018,jaime lannister,5,47,the gift,DORNE_1,I don’t understand.

17054,petyr baelish,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BAELISH’S BROTHEL,It felt like the safest place.
17055,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BAELISH’S BROTHEL,"Not for your clientele, clearly."
17056,petyr baelish,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BAELISH’S BROTHEL,"It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn’t exist until we invented them."
17057,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BAELISH’S BROTHEL,"You’ve always been rather impressed with yourself, haven’t you?"
17058,petyr baelish,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BAELISH’S BROTHEL,The past is the past. The future is all that’s worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.

So do you deny a part in all of this?"
17062,petyr baelish,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BAELISH’S BROTHEL,Cersei summoned me to King’s Landing. I dared not refuse her.
17063,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BAELISH’S BROTHEL,And what did she want?
17064,petyr baelish,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BAELISH’S BROTHEL,"A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."

17079,hizdahr zo loraq,5,47,the gift,FIGHTING PIT_1,"Your Grace, it’s a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged."
17080,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,FIGHTING PIT_1,I’ve sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
17081,tyrion lannister,5,47,the gift,FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA_1,What are you doing?
17082,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,FIGHTING PIT_4,Get him out of my sight.
17083,jorah mormont,5,47,the gift,FIGHTING PIT_4,"Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift."

17087,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BLACK CELL,"This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It’s quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."
17088,margaery tyrell,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BLACK CELL,I know you did this.
17089,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BLACK CELL,We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
17090,margaery tyrell,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BLACK CELL,"Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You’re not very good at those, I’m afraid. Perhaps that’s why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me."
17091,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BLACK CELL,You’re upset. You’re not thinking clearly. I’ll visit again when you’ve had a chance to calm down.
17092,margaery tyrell,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BLACK CELL,I don’t want to see you again.
17093,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BLACK CELL,"I do hope you change your mind about that. I’ve been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."
17094,margaery tyrell,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BLACK CELL,Leave.
17095,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BLACK CELL,"Yes, I’m afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever."
17096,margaery tyrell,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BLACK CELL,Get out you hateful bitch!
17097,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,KING’S LANDING - BLACK CELL,"Sleep well, sister."
17098,high sparrow,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,Thank you. (to Cersei) You saw her?
17099,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,Yes.
17100,sparrow,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,And?
17101,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
17102,sparrow,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
17103,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,Who will stand judge?
17104,sparrow,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
17105,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,Will you be one of them?
17106,sparrow,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,I will.
17107,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
17108,sparrow,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,Then they will be at The Mother’s mercy.
17109,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,What does The Mother’s mercy entail?
17110,sparrow,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,"It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."
17111,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
17112,sparrow,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King’s Landing?
17113,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,I think I may have heard at one point.
17114,sparrow,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.
17115,sparrow,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,Who carved this altar do you know?
17116,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,I’m afraid i don’t.
17117,sparrow,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,No one does. There’s no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn’t inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.
17118,sparrow,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,"A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird."
17119,sparrow,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,And he has much to say about you.
17120,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,Move. Let me go immediately.
17121,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL,You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!
17122,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,BLACK CELL,Look at me. Look at my face. It’s the last thing you’ll see before you die.
17123,jorah mormont,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,"Your Grace, I want to say--"
17124,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
17125,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,If only I were otherwise.
17126,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn’t I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
17127,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
17128,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
17129,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It’s too soon to know if you deserve my service.
17130,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,If you’d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
17131,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,"When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
17132,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
17133,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
17134,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,I have a very large army and very large dragons.
17135,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
17136,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,So you want to advise me. Very well. (looks to Jorah) What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
17137,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,I know.
17138,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,Why should the people trust a queen who can’t keep her promises?
17139,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,"Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can’t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
17140,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
17141,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,"Yes, many opportunities."
17142,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,And did he?
17143,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,No. Not until forced to do so.
17144,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,"He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
17145,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,So I should kill him?
17146,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,"A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you’re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you’re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
17147,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN - PYRAMID_1,Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
17148,septa,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS,Confess.
17149,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS,My son. Let me speak to--
17150,septa,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS,Confess. I meant it.
17151,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS,My face will be the last thing you see before--
17152,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"My name is Lana. I’m an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more."
17153,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,EXT. BRAAVOS - MARKET,"Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"
17154,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,"Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade."
17155,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.
17156,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,How will she serve him?
17157,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
17158,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,What will she do there?
17159,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,She will see.
17160,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,See what?
17161,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,"How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her."
17162,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,"Oysters, clams and cockles!"
17163,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
17164,thin man,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,Your oysters fresh?
17165,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,Best in the city.
17166,thin man,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,You wouldn’t lie to an old man would you?
17167,thin man,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.
17169,thin man,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,Can’t do it.
17171,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
17172,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
17173,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,A girl tells a man that she has seen.
17174,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,"If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money."
17175,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,"But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn’t have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?"
17176,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,The Many Faced God. You said you didn’t know what I would see at the docks.
17177,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
17178,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,And then what?
17179,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,A gift for the Thin Man.
17180,waif,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,She is not ready.
17181,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,"Perhaps she is, perhaps she’s not."
17182,waif,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,And if she’s not?
17183,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE,It is all the same to the Many Faced God.
17184,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.
17185,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,The charges?
17186,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,"Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert."
17187,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,All lies.
17188,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,"Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you’ll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason."
17189,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,I wish you’d said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
17190,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,"I’m afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council."
17191,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,Tell him I need to speak to him.
17192,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,I implored him to visit you but he would not.
17193,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,"What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
17194,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,"Your arrest, and Queen Margaery’s arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched."
17195,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,"You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
17196,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,"I tried my grace, he wouldn’t see me. He wouldn’t see anyone."
17197,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,I can’t stay here.
17198,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,"There is a way, Your Grace. A way out."
17199,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,"Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won’t. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness."
17200,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_1,Goodbye my queen. The work continues.
17201,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,Why. Why Theon.
17202,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
17203,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,"Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?"
17204,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,"I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
17205,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,"Good. If it weren’t for you I’d still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would."
17206,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
17207,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,"They weren’t “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you’d know them since they were born."
17208,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,They weren’t. They were only--
17209,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,Only what?
17210,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,I can’t..
17211,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,Tell me!
17212,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,"I can’t, not unless the master says..."
17213,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,"Tell me, they weren’t what?!"
17214,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,They weren’t...
17215,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,They weren’t Bran and Rickon! I couldn’t find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
17216,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,You didn’t…?
17217,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,"Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
17218,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,I can’t talk to you anymore.
17219,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,"Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--"
17220,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER_1,"Not Theon, Reek!"
17222,roose bolton,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - HALL,"And how high can Stannis’ horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny."
17223,roose bolton,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - HALL,You disagree?
17224,ramsay bolton,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - HALL,"Stannis isn’t from the North. You are, father. I think you’re missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders."
17225,roose bolton,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - HALL,And what do you recommend?
17226,ramsay bolton,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - HALL,"That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows."
17227,roose bolton,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - HALL,A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can’t touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn’t get an army through if we wanted to.
17228,ramsay bolton,5,48,hardhome,WINTERFELL - HALL,I don’t need an army. I need 20 good men.
17229,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,So have you decided yet? Whether I’m worthy of your service?
17230,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,Have you decided yet whether you’re going to have me killed?
17231,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,It’s probably my safest option.
17232,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,I can see why you would think so. It’s what your father would have done.
17233,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,And what would your father do?
17234,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I’d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
17235,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,Is that why you killed him?
17236,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,"Some day if you decide not to execute me, I’ll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we’ll need more wine than this."
17237,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
17238,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,"So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
17239,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,I’m terrible?
17240,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,I’ve heard stories.
17241,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
17242,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
17243,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,Which kind is that?
17244,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
17245,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
17246,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,"Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
17247,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,Perhaps it won’t come to that.
17248,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,It’s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
17249,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,Varys? King Robert’s spy master?
17250,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
17251,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
17252,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn’t have to do. I suspect he’s the main reason you weren’t slaughtered in your crib.
17253,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,But you trust him?
17254,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,"Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
17255,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,The brother who killed my father.
17256,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,That’s the one.
17257,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
17258,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,"Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
17259,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,I’m not going to kill you.
17260,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,No? Banish me?
17261,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,No.
17262,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,"So if I’m not going to be murdered, and I’m not going to be banished..."
17263,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,You’re going to advise me. (takes his wine cup) While you can still speak in complete sentences.
17264,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,Advise you on what?
17265,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,How to get what I want.
17266,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
17267,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,If I want jokes I’ll get myself a proper fool.
17268,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,I’m not entirely joking. There’s more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
17269,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,I fought so that no child born into Slaver’s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
17270,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,"And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
17271,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,The common people.
17272,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,"Let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen. Here in Slaver’s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won’t back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won’t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
17273,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,"Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They’re all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
17274,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,It’s a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You’re not the first person to have dreamt it.
17275,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,MEEREEN_4,I’m not going to stop the wheel. I’m going to break the wheel.
17276,jorah mormont,5,48,hardhome,FIGHTING PIT_5,You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.
17278,jorah mormont,5,48,hardhome,FIGHTING PIT_5,I’ve been flogged if it makes you happy. I’m the best you’ve got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
17280,jorah mormont,5,48,hardhome,FIGHTING PIT_5,Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
17281,septa,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_2,Thirsty? Confess.
17282,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_2,"I’ll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
17283,septa,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_2,Confess.
17284,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_2,I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.
17285,septa,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_2,Confess.
17286,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,BLACK CELLS_2,"I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die."
17287,gilly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,Does it hurt?
17288,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,No.
17289,gilly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,Good.
17290,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,How are you?
17291,gilly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,I’m not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.
17292,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,You know what I mean.
17293,gilly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,I’m good.
17294,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,Are you scared?
17295,gilly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,A little.
17296,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,Me too.
17297,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,Who’s there?
17298,olly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,Olly.
17299,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,Come in.
17300,olly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,I heard what happened.
17301,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It’s only natural.
17302,olly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,Figured you were hungry.
17303,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,You’re a good lad.
17304,olly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,Wanted to ask you something. (Olly looks at Gilly) If you’ve got the time.
17305,gilly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,I need to check on baby Sam.
17306,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,Now then. How can I help?
17307,olly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,It’s about the Lord Commander.
17308,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,Yes?
17309,olly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,He’s going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.
17310,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,We’ve been fighting them for years.
17311,olly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,This wasn’t a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why’s he saving them?
17312,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,"Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."
17313,olly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,"The one he’s travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village."
17314,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,Olly...
17315,olly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,How can he trust him?
17316,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,"I’ve seen the army of the dead. I’ve seen the white walkers, and they’re coming for us, for all the living. And when it’s time we’ll need every last man we can find."
17317,olly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?
17318,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,"Jon’s taking a risk, but he has to. We don’t stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
17319,olly,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,You believe that?
17320,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,With all my heart.
17321,sam,5,48,hardhome,CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM,Try not to worry Olly. I’ve been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.
17322,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE,You trust me Jon Snow?
17323,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE,Does that make me a fool?
17324,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE,We are fools together now.
17325,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE,Lord of Bones. Been a long time.
17327,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE,War.
17329,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE,We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.
17331,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE,I’m not giving an order.
17333,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE,He’s not my prisoner.
17335,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE,We’re allies.
17337,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE,I don’t fight for the crows.
17338,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE,We’re not here to fight. We’re here to talk.
17340,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE,Gather the elders and let’s talk.
17341,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,My name’s Jon Snow. I’m Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. We’re not friends. We’ve never been friends. We won’t become friends today. This isn’t about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what’s out there.
17342,karsi,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,You built that wall to keep us out.
17343,loboda,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?
17344,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,In normal times we wouldn’t. But these aren’t normal times. The white walkers don’t care if a man’s Free Folk or Crow. We’re all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
17345,karsi,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,"Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe."
17346,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,It’s not a trick. It’s a gift for those who join us.
17347,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,Dragonglass. A man of the Night’s Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
17348,loboda,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,You saw this?
17349,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,No. But I trust the man.
17350,karsi,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,There are old stories about Dragonglass.
17351,loboda,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.
17352,karsi,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,And with the things we’ve seen you don’t believe them?
17353,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
17354,karsi,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,Come with you where?
17355,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,There are good lands south of the wall.  The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
17356,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,"I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night’s Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We’re prepared to give you that new life."
17357,karsi,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,If…?
17358,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
17359,loboda,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,Where is Mance?
17360,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,He died.
17361,loboda,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,How?
17362,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,I put an arrow through his heart.
17363,loboda,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.
17364,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,"None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt’s orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that’s what we need today"
17365,karsi,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,"I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows."
17366,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,"I’m not asking you to forget your dead. I’ll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I’m asking you to think about your children now. They’ll never have children of their own if we don’t band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can’t stop them. The Night’s Watch can’t stop them. And all the southern kings can’t stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we’ll give the fuckers a fight."
17367,karsi,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,"You vouch for this man, Tormund?"
17368,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,"He’s prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He’s young, but he knows how to lead. He didn’t have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him."
17369,loboda,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.
17370,karsi,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,"So would mine, but fuck 'em, they’re dead."
17371,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,This is the way.
17372,wildling elder,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,I’m with Tormund. We stay here we’re dead men. At least with King Crow there’s a chance.
17374,loboda,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,"Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they’re gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That’s our enemy. That has always been our enemy."
17375,karsi,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN,I fucking hate Thenns.
17376,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_1,How many are with us? 5000?
17377,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_1,I’m not good at counting.
17378,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_1,We’re leaving too many behind.
17379,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_1,The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.
17380,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_1,And he knew them better than I ever will.
17381,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_1,They’re running out of food and there’s nothing to hunt. They’ll come around.
17382,karsi,5,48,hardhome,Karsi loading two children onto a boat.,"Johnna is gonna look after you. She’s in charge, you listen to her."
17384,karsi,5,48,hardhome,Karsi loading two children onto a boat.,"I need to get the old folks on the boats. I’m right behind you, I promise. (she kisses them on the forehead) Go on."
17385,wun wun,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN_1,Lokh kif rukh?
17386,loboda,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - GATE,Shut the gate.
17387,loboda,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - GATE,Shut the gate!!
17389,loboda,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - GATE,Ready your arrows!
17390,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_3,Get in line! Get in line!
17391,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_4,Hold the line! Hold the line!
17393,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_4,Get them to the ship and come back for me!
17395,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_4,Now!
17396,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_4,You should be on one of those boats.
17397,karsi,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_4,So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you’re not there ?
17398,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_4,You have my word. I’ve given orders.
17399,karsi,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_4,Don’t think you’re gonna be there to enforce those orders !
17400,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_4,"If they get through, everyone dies !"
17401,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_4,Night’s Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!
17402,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_5,The Dragonglass!
17403,loboda,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_5,"You’re with me, lad! Now!"
17404,loboda,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - CABIN_3,Get the glass.
17405,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,"Jon crawling across the snow, coughing up blood. A man grabs him and Jon puts Longclaw to his neck. The man turns out to be Edd and they lower their weapons.",The Dragonglass!
17406,eddison tollett,5,48,hardhome,"Jon crawling across the snow, coughing up blood. A man grabs him and Jon puts Longclaw to his neck. The man turns out to be Edd and they lower their weapons.",Fuck the glass! We’re gonna die here.

17408,tormund,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_6,"Wun Wun, to the sea."
17409,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,HARDHOME - SHORE_6,Let’s go now! Now!
17410,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP - MORNING,"A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--"
17411,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP - MORNING,Horses?
17412,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP - MORNING,"We’re still getting a count, but hundreds are dead."
17413,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP - MORNING,20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
17414,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP - MORNING,The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
17415,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP - MORNING,"Put last night’s guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them."
17416,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP - MORNING,"Unless there’s a thaw, we can’t press forward to Winterfell, and we don’t have enough food to get us back to Castle Black."
17417,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP - MORNING,We’re not returning to Castle Black.
17418,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP - MORNING,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can’t march forward, and we won’t march back…"
17419,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP - MORNING,Have the dead horses butchered for meat.
17420,alliser thorne,5,49,the dance of dragons,THE WALL_4,Open the gates.
17421,jon snow,5,49,the dance of dragons,CASTLE BLACK_13,It was a failure.
17422,sam,5,49,the dance of dragons,CASTLE BLACK_13,It wasn’t.
17423,jon snow,5,49,the dance of dragons,CASTLE BLACK_13,"I went to save them, I failed."
17424,sam,5,49,the dance of dragons,CASTLE BLACK_13,"You didn’t fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else."
17425,jon snow,5,49,the dance of dragons,CASTLE BLACK_13,I don’t think that fact’s lost on them.
17426,alliser thorne,5,49,the dance of dragons,"many men of the Night’s Watch glaring at Jon, then Olly who exchanges a long look with Jon from the top of the stairs. Alliser walks down the steps to Jon.","You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed."
17427,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ TENT,"You sent for me, Your Grace."
17428,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ TENT,"Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I’m sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I’ll make sure the Night’s Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes."
17429,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ TENT,"Your Grace, you’ve named me your Hand."
17430,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ TENT,Yes.
17431,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ TENT,"The King’s Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war."

17433,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ TENT,A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
17434,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ TENT,"And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn’t name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don’t come back empty handed."
17435,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ TENT,"Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me."
17436,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ TENT,My family stays with me.
17437,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ TENT,At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.

17441,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT,Well that sounds like a proper story.
17442,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT,"Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection."
17443,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT,"But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield."
17444,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT,And burnt him to a crisp.
17445,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT,"Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess."
17446,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT,Do you like it?

17451,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT,Of course I will.
17452,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT,But why am I getting a present?
17453,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT,"Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. (beat) I’ll be gone for a few days, Princess. I’ll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I’m back."
17454,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT,You’ll just have to read it yourself.
17455,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,Prince Doran. (bows)
17456,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,"Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit."
17457,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,Princess Myrcella.
17458,myrcella baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,Uncle.
17459,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,What a lovely dress.
17460,myrcella baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,You don’t like it?
17461,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,You must be cold.
17462,myrcella baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.
17463,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,Prince Trystane. How’s your jaw?
17464,trystane martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,A fleabite.
17465,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,What are you doing in Dorne?
17466,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,"Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella."
17467,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.
17468,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,We received a threatening message. The princess’s necklace in the jaws of a viper.
17469,myrcella baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,That necklace was stolen from my room.
17470,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
17471,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,We can’t behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I’ve seen war. I’ve seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I’ve seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don’t want to lead my people into that hell.
17472,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,"No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters."
17473,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,"And that is precisely what we are doing. (raises glass) Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms."
17474,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,King Tommen insists on his sister’s return to the capital?
17475,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,I’m afraid he does.
17476,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,"I cannot disobey my King’s command. (Ellaria glares at Doran) She will return with you to King’s Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand."
17477,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,I accept.
17478,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,"One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council."
17479,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,You have my word.
17480,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,The word of a Kingslayer.
17481,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,No wonder you can’t stand. You have no spine.
17482,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,"You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won’t."
17483,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,May I inquire into the fate of my man?
17484,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,"Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King’s Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?"
17485,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it’s me.
17486,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he’s to rule one day. I’ll let him decide.
17487,trystane martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.
17488,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,You’re a good man.
17489,trystane martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE,On one condition.
17490,nymeria,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - CELL_1,"Why do we play? I’m better than you, I’ll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don’t think, I can’t recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- (slaps) -- pain? That one hurt didn’t it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister."
17491,tyene sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - CELL_1,You’re going to miss.
17492,nymeria,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - CELL_1,I never miss.
17493,tyene sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - CELL_1,You will. You’re thinking too much. Now you’re nervous. “What if she’s right?”
17494,nymeria,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - CELL_1,Luck.
17495,tyene sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - CELL_1,Now it’s my turn.
17496,nymeria,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - CELL_1,You’re too slow. You’ve always been too slow.
17497,bronn,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - CELL_1,Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?
17498,areo hotah,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - CELL_1,You’ll find out very soon.
17499,tyene sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - CELL_1,"Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?"
17500,bronn,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - CELL_1,The most beautiful woman in the world.
17501,tyene sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - CELL_1,And that’s the truth!
17502,nymeria,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - CELL_1,Slut.
17503,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE_1,"Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
17504,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE_1,
17505,bronn,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE_1,Only the one.
17506,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE_1,I believe you’ve already met Prince Trystane.
17507,bronn,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE_1,Prince. Sorry about the other day.
17508,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE_1,Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He’s agreed to grant you your freedom.
17509,bronn,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE_1,I’m glad to hear it. The pie looks good.
17510,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE_1,There was one condition.
17511,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE_1,Perhaps some soup instead?
17512,arya stark,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR_1,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--"
17514,arya stark,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR_1,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!"
17515,thin man,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR_1,Come on.
17516,thin man,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR_1,"Some oysters, girl! I’m talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!"
17517,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR_1,"Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free."
17518,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR_1,Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.
17519,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR_1,And how goes the harvest in the Reach?
17520,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR_1,"Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I’ll be sure to send the Arbor’s finest your way."
17521,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR_1,I’m afraid I don’t partake.
17522,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - IRON BANK,"Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course."
17523,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - IRON BANK,I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.
17524,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - IRON BANK,Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.
17525,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - IRON BANK,Most unfortunate for the glovers.
17526,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - IRON BANK,"If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble."
17527,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - IRON BANK,"We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell."
17528,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - IRON BANK,You are the world's best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.
17529,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,IRON BANK - LATER,I’m afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
17530,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,IRON BANK - LATER,"Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?"
17531,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,IRON BANK - LATER,I don't have that gift.
17532,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,IRON BANK - LATER,"It's not a gift, it’s a skill, anyone can learn it. “So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown…”"
17533,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - BROTHEL - DOORWAY,I thought that old shit would never stop singing.
17535,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - BROTHEL - DOORWAY,"The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king."
17536,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - BROTHEL - DOORWAY,"This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos."
17538,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,BRAAVOS - BROTHEL - DOORWAY,"Oh, I’m buying. But I never was good at sharing."
17539,brothel keeper,5,49,the dance of dragons,BROTHEL_7,Sell your fish somewhere else.
17542,arya stark,5,49,the dance of dragons,BROTHEL_7,Three coppers.
17543,jon snow,5,49,the dance of dragons,BROTHEL_7,Here’s a silver because the lady likes you.
17544,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,BROTHEL - BACK ROOM,Too old.
17545,head prostitute,5,49,the dance of dragons,BROTHEL - BACK ROOM,Brea.
17546,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,BROTHEL - BACK ROOM,Too old.
17548,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,BROTHEL - BACK ROOM,Too old.
17549,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,BROTHEL - BACK ROOM,Do you have what I want or not?
17555,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,BROTHEL - BACK ROOM,Good.
17556,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,BROTHEL - BACK ROOM,I’ll tell you when we’re done.
17557,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,BROTHEL - BACK ROOM,You’ll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.
17561,jaqen h'ghar,5,49,the dance of dragons,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_2,And?
17562,arya stark,5,49,the dance of dragons,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_2,The Thin Man wasn’t hungry today.
17563,jaqen h'ghar,5,49,the dance of dragons,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_2,Perhaps that’s why the man is thin.
17564,arya stark,5,49,the dance of dragons,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_2,Tomorrow.
17565,jaqen h'ghar,5,49,the dance of dragons,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_2,Tomorrow.
17566,jaqen h'ghar,5,49,the dance of dragons,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_2,A girl has work to do.
17567,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE_2,"Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die."
17568,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - PALACE_2,I believe in second chances. I don’t believe in third chances.
17569,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - JAIME’S ROOM,You write like a 7 year old.
17570,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - JAIME’S ROOM,Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
17571,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - JAIME’S ROOM,He didn’t try to make you pay?
17572,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - JAIME’S ROOM,Then maybe he’s changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you’ll be bringing her daughter home
17573,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - JAIME’S ROOM,She will.
17574,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - JAIME’S ROOM,"You love her very much, don’t you?"
17575,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - JAIME’S ROOM,"Of course, she’s my niece."
17576,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - JAIME’S ROOM,I wasn’t talking about her.
17577,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - JAIME’S ROOM,"You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen.  It’s always changing, who we’re supposed to love and who we’re not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want."
17578,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,DORNE - JAIME’S ROOM,I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.
17579,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,Father. Aren’t you cold?
17580,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,No. What are you reading?
17581,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,The Dance of Dragons.
17582,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,What’s it about?
17583,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,"It’s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered."
17584,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,“The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
17585,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,That’s just what they call it.
17586,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,Doesn’t make much sense.
17587,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,I think it’s poetic.
17588,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,"If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?"
17589,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,I wouldn’t have chosen either. It’s all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
17590,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,"Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it."
17591,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,"It’s alright, father."
17592,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,You don’t even know what I’m talking about.
17593,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,It doesn’t matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?
17594,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,Yes there is.
17595,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,"Good, I want to. I’m the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I’m your daughter."
17596,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,SHIREEN’S TENT_1,Forgive me.
17597,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP_2,Where’s my father? I want to see my father.
17598,melisandre,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP_2,"It will all be over soon, Princess."
17599,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP_2,"Where’s my father? No you can’t do this, father where are you?!"
17600,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP_2,"Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!"
17601,selyse baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP_2,It’s what the Lord wants. It’s a good thing. A great thing.
17602,melisandre,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP_2,"The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way."
17603,selyse baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP_2,"If we don’t act then we’ll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice…"
17604,melisandre,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP_2,"Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!"
17605,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP_2,"Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!"
17606,selyse baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP_2,I can’t.
17607,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP_2,There’s no other way. She has King’s blood.
17608,melisandre,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP_2,"Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!"
17609,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP_2,"Mother, don’t do this please! Please help! Don’t do this! Please, father! Mother, help!"
17610,selyse baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,STANNIS’ CAMP_2,No...
17611,daenerys targaryen,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,Where have you been?
17612,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,Just making sure everything’s in order.
17615,quick,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."
17617,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,They’re waiting for you. Clap your hands.
17618,daario naharis,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,"That one, the smaller man, no question, that’s where you should put your money."
17619,tyrion lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,The smaller man it is.
17620,daenerys targaryen,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,I’m not putting my money anywhere.
17621,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
17622,daario naharis,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. (looks at Hizdahr) He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.
17623,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,"I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not."
17624,daenerys targaryen,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,"Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?"
17625,daario naharis,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,"Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn’t get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here (he puts a dagger to his neck) or here (he puts the dagger to Hizdahr’s neck). And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren’t. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy."
17626,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,You don’t approve?
17627,tyrion lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,There’s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
17628,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,"Fair enough, yet -- it’s an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?"
17629,tyrion lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,It’s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
17630,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT,I’m not talking about myself. I’m talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.
17631,daenerys targaryen,5,49,the dance of dragons,"pit workers carrying the decapitated head out of the pit, leaving a trail of blood behind.",That is greatness?
17632,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,"pit workers carrying the decapitated head out of the pit, leaving a trail of blood behind.",That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen.

17791,jorah mormont,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
17792,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,"He’s right. The dragon headed north. If we’re going to find her, that’s where we’re to go."

17795,jorah mormont,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,You’ve been here for how many days now? I’ve fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
17796,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,You betrayed her!
17797,jorah mormont,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,Careful now.
17798,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,"And she exiled you, twice, I believe?"

17802,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,"Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep."

17809,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,I have fought. I don’t claim to be a great warrior.
17810,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,Are you good on a horse?
17811,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,Middling.
17812,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,So mainly you talk?
17813,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,And drink. I’ve survived so far.
17814,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,"Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. (to Missandei, Grey Worm, and Jorah) None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen."
17815,jorah mormont,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,He’s a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
17816,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,They wouldn’t. They will listen to Grey Worm.
17817,grey worm,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,I’ll come with you. I’ll find our queen.
17818,missandei,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
17819,grey worm,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,I am.
17820,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,"He is, he’s the toughest man with no balls I’ve ever met. But you still can’t go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen."
17821,missandei,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,"It’s true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half."
17822,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID_2,"And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen’s closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. (to Tyrion) Try not to ruin her. (to Jorah) Looks like it’s you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let’s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about."
17824,varys,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - BALCONY,I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
17825,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - BALCONY,I suppose there’s no point in asking how you found me.
17826,varys,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - BALCONY,"The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you’ve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons."
17827,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - BALCONY,"Well, she didn’t execute me, so that’s a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I’m stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?"
17828,varys,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - BALCONY,Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies’ strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
17829,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - BALCONY,If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
17830,varys,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - BALCONY,"If only. (beat) A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?"
17831,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - BALCONY,I did miss you.
17832,varys,5,50,mother's mercy,MEEREEN - BALCONY,"Oh, I know."
17833,daenerys targaryen,5,50,mother's mercy,COUNTRYSIDE - PLATEAU,We have to go home.
17834,daenerys targaryen,5,50,mother's mercy,COUNTRYSIDE - PLATEAU,"My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? (pause) We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?"
17835,daenerys targaryen,5,50,mother's mercy,COUNTRYSIDE - PLATEAU,How far did you carry me? (surveys the area)
17836,daenerys targaryen,5,50,mother's mercy,COUNTRYSIDE - PLATEAU,"Drogon, we need to return. My people need me."
17837,daenerys targaryen,5,50,mother's mercy,COUNTRYSIDE - PLATEAU,"Well, there’s no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper."
17838,septa,5,50,mother's mercy,CERSEI’S CELL,Confess. Confess.

17848,sparrow,5,50,mother's mercy,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW’S ROOM,You had a husband.
17849,cersei lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW’S ROOM,A husband of whoring every chance he got.
17850,sparrow,5,50,mother's mercy,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW’S ROOM,His sins do not pardon your own.
17851,cersei lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW’S ROOM,May the gods forgive me.

17857,cersei lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW’S ROOM,I do.
17858,sparrow,5,50,mother's mercy,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW’S ROOM,There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.
17859,cersei lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW’S ROOM,"A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother’s children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers’. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it."
17860,sparrow,5,50,mother's mercy,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW’S ROOM,"Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence."
17861,cersei lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW’S ROOM,Trial? I have confessed?
17862,sparrow,5,50,mother's mercy,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW’S ROOM,To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.
17863,cersei lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW’S ROOM,I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother’s mercy. I haven’t seen my son… I don’t know how long it’s been. I need to see him. Please.
17864,sparrow,5,50,mother's mercy,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW’S ROOM,"You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep."

17885,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,CASTLE BLACK_15,It’s not their fight!
17886,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,CASTLE BLACK_15,Stannis?

17935,ramsay bolton,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - ROOM,"Myranda wasn’t, though. What could I do to her that those hounds couldn’t? She was fearless. There was nothing she wouldn’t do."

17943,roose bolton,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1,"I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark. Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?"
17944,ramsay bolton,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1,No.
17945,roose bolton,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1,A reckoning will come. We need the North to face it. The entire North. They won’t back us without Sansa Stark.

18577,olenna tyrell,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,"I was invited, my dear, o help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen’s imprisonment."
18578,cersei lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,Thank you for bringing it up. It’s well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.
18579,olenna tyrell,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,Margaery is the queen. You are not the queen because you’re not married to the king. I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family.
18580,kevan lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,This is a Small Council meeting. You have no position on the Small Council.
18581,jaime lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,I’m Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council.
18582,cersei lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,"Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?"
18583,pycelle,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,"Well, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King’s council. Of course, that was the Mad King. King Robert saw things differently."
18584,cersei lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,"What about Myrcella’s death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?"
18585,jaime lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne. We've got a lot to discuss. All of us together.
18586,cersei lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,"And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it."
18587,kevan lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER,"No, we cannot make you leave. And you cannot make us stay. Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all."

18590,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,"Oh, I'm, sorry, your Grace. That’s not possible. Not yet."
18591,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,When will it be possible?
18592,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,When she's fully atoned for her sins.
18593,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,You’ve cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city. That wasn’t a full atonement?
18594,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,"No. She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins."
18595,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,I want you to let her see Myrcella’s resting place.
18596,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,I am the king.
18597,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,You are.
18598,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,And what does that mean to you?
18599,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,It means a great deal to me. The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world. Do you know who told me that? Your mother.
18600,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you’ve put her through?
18601,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,"How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother’s presence? It was through their own mothers. There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that. But when she speaks of you, the Mother’s love outshines it all. Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world. Because it doesn’t come from this world. But you know that. You’ve felt it. You’ve seen her when she talks to you."
18602,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,Yes.
18603,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,It’s a great gift. One I never had. Envy. One more thing for me to atone for.
18604,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,"You Grace, may I? Do you mind? It's my knees."
18605,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,Of course.
18606,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,"When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you."
18607,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,I still don’t understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured.
18608,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,It’s not what I want. It’s what the gods want. They make their will known to us and it’s up to us to either accept or reject it.
18609,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,Please.
18610,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,"If we’re to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings. A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can. And no one is wiser than the gods."
18611,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,My grandfather once said something similar. Except for the part about the gods.
18612,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM,The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not. As they work through your mother. There’s so much good in all of us. The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.

18646,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Your father was a cunt.

18648,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,"Your father was a cunt and that’s why you killed him.  I might’ve done the same to my father, if he hadn’t have done me the favor of dying on his own."

18650,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Mmm.

18652,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,"The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.  We’re farther north than any of you fuckers.

18653,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,So now you’ve come seeking help?

18661,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Why would I trust a man who won’t honor tradition?
18662,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Your father honored tradition. Knelt for Robb Stark. Called him King of the North. Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?
18663,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.

19202,euron greyjoy,6,55,the door,New Scene_4,A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
19203,yara greyjoy,6,55,the door,New Scene_4,I’m glad you’re here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.
19204,euron greyjoy,6,55,the door,New Scene_4,I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren’t for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn’t win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.

19210,yara greyjoy,6,55,the door,New Scene_4,I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
19211,euron greyjoy,6,55,the door,New Scene_4,"Right idea, except I’m the one who’s going to build the Iron Fleet because I’m the one who knows how to use it. I’ve been all over the world. I’ve seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I’m going to build that fleet and I’m going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock."
19212,euron greyjoy,6,55,the door,New Scene_5,I’m not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we’re going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn’t born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.

19252,kinvara,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,You don’t need to persuade me. I came to help.
19253,kinvara,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
19254,tyrion lannister,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,Yes.
19255,kinvara,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.

20362,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT,No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.
20363,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,You think there’s hope?
20364,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,"I’ve never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they’ve never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there’s hope. You want to avenge your king, don’t you?"
20365,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,It wasn’t the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
20366,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,You saw these demons?
20367,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,What?
20368,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,"No, it’s a manner of speaking. Not actual demons."
20369,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,"Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn’t have demons in his skull. He didn’t torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you."
20370,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,"Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings."
20371,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,Jon Snow’s not a king.
20372,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,"No, he’s not."
20373,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat’s milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
20374,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,"No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle."
20375,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,So what do you do all night?
20376,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I’m far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
20377,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT,Happy shitting.

20384,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT,I’m ordering you not to bring me back.
20385,melisandre,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT,"I am not your servant, Jon Snow."
20386,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT,You’re in my camp. I’m the commander.
20387,melisandre,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT,I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.

20389,melisandre,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT,"I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn’t want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you."
20390,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT,Why?
20391,melisandre,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT,I don’t know. Maybe you’re only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.

Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."

20892,marwyn,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB,"Not a very strong proposition, is it?"
20893,sam,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB,"Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
20894,marwyn,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB,Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.

20896,marwyn,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB,The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.

Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--""The end is near! How will we survive?"" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended."

21095,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,It's something he said to me the first night we met.  You know him better than any of us.  What do you think?
21096,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters.  He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk.  ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.  Join us.  Together we can end her tyranny."""
21097,davos seaworth,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"Sounds like a charmer.  Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming."
21098,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,What?
21099,davos seaworth,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"Fire kills Whites, you told me.  What breathes fire?"
21100,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
21101,davos seaworth,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"No, too dangerous."
21102,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,But?
21103,davos seaworth,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?"
21104,cersei lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,"If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it.  Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.  But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown.  With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores.  Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts.  Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought.  This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty."
21105,cersei lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,"You all remember the Mad King.  You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.  His daughter is no different.  In Essos her brutality is already legendary.  She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.  And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons."
21106,cersei lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,"It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords.  We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her."
21107,randyll tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,"She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace.  The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms.  How do you propose to stop them?"
21108,qyburn,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,"We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord."
21109,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,Lord Tarley.
21110,randyll tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,"Ser, Jaime.  I believe you know my son."
21111,dickon tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,"Ser, Jaime."
21112,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,"Rickon, isn't it?"
21113,dickon tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,Dickon.
21114,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,That's it.
21115,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,Thank you for coming.  The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever.  They might not have come if you hadn't.
21116,randyll tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,"If my queen summons me, I answer the call.  And I've heard what she does to those that defy her."
21117,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,Do you ride for Hornhill today?
21118,randyll tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,I have an army to mobilize.  It won't be long until the fighting starts.
21119,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,And what side will you be fighting for?  You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.  Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
21120,randyll tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,"It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime.  How may I serve?"
21121,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.  I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies.  All of her enemies.
21122,randyll tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,Including Olenna Tyrell?  I'm a Tarley.  That name means something.  We're not oath breakers.  We're not schemers.  We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings.   I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
21123,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,"You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."
21124,randyll tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,I've known Olenna since I was a child.
21125,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,"She was a great woman, once.  Now she's broken.  She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores.  The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.  I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice.  Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?"
21126,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM,When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south.  I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
21127,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,The infection has spread too far.  You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
21128,jorah mormont,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,How long?
21129,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,"It will be years before it kills you.  It could be 10, could be 20."
21130,jorah mormont,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,But how long 'till...
21131,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,"Your mind?  Six months, maybe fewer."
21132,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,"Pardon, Archmaester.  I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black.  She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured.  Isn't there some way --"
21133,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,Does this look like a baby to you?
21134,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,No.
21135,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
21136,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,No.
21137,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
21138,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,"This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser.  Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men.  As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day.  How you choose to spend that time is up to you."
21139,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,"Come, Samwell."
21140,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,"Should we send word to your family, Ser..."
21141,jorah mormont,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,Jorah.  Jorah Mormont.
21142,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,Mormont?
21143,jorah mormont,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,There's no need.  I've been dead to them for years.
21144,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS,"Come, Samwell."
21145,qyburn,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?"
21146,cersei lannister,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"No, I can't say I have.  I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room."
21147,qyburn,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
21148,cersei lannister,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,They were his trophies.  He couldn't keep them around.  They would have made him look small.  Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.  I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
21149,qyburn,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"Balerion the Dread.  The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.  Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.  Powerful, but not invincible."
21150,qyburn,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.  If they can be wounded, they can be killed."
21151,qyburn,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace.  If you'd kindly pull that lever."
21152,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,"If you want the Iron Throne, take it.  We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons.  We should hit King's Landing now.  Hard.  With everything we have.  The city will fall within a day."
21153,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,"If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms."
21154,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,"It's called war.  You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding."
21155,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,I know how you wage war.  We don't poison little girls here.  Myrcella was innocent.
21156,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,She was a Lannister.  There are no innocent Lannisters.  My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
21157,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,That's enough.  Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen.  You will treat him with respect.
21158,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
21159,olenna tyrell,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,"That's very nice to hear.  Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter.  The common people loved her, the nobles loved her.  And what is left of her now?  Ashes.  Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really.  They won't obey you unless they fear you."
21160,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,"I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council.  I'm grateful to all of you.  But you have chosen to follow me.  I will not attack King's Landing.  We will not attack King's Landing."
21161,olenna tyrell,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?  By asking nicely?
21162,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides.  Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
21163,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
21164,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,"Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country.  If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.  Our army should be Westerosi."
21165,elia martell,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
21166,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,You are.
21167,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
21168,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army.  Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
21169,olenna tyrell,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,"So, your master plan is to use our armies?  Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?"
21170,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,The unsullied will have another objective.  For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.  And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.  Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
21171,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,Do I have your support?
21172,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,You have mine.
21173,elia martell,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,"Dorne is with you, Your Grace."
21174,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,"Thank you all.  Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?"
21175,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.  But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
21176,olenna tyrell,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,"Peace.  Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his?  Peace never lasts, my dear.  Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?"
21177,olenna tyrell,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE,"He's a clever man, your Hand.  I've known a great many clever men.  I've outlived them all.  Do you know why?  I ignored them.  The lords of Westeros are sheep.  Are you a sheep?  No.  You're a dragon.  Be a dragon."

21179,missandei,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,You leave tomorrow.  Were you going to say goodbye?
21180,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,I will see you when I return.
21181,missandei,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,But you don't know when that will be.
21182,greyworm,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,No one knows.
21183,missandei,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,I wish you good fortune.
21184,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,Missandei --
21185,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
21186,missandei,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,Why?
21187,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,You know why.
21188,missandei,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,I don't.
21189,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,You are my weakness.
21190,missandei,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,That's what I am?  Your weakness?
21191,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,"When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears.  One boy is scared of dogs.  One boy hates high places.  One is frightened of the ocean.  They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff.  They throw him in the water.  If he learns to swim, good.  If he drowns, good.  Either way, strong Unsullied.  But I had no fears.  I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always."
21192,missandei,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,I believe it.
21193,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth.  Now I have fear.
21194,missandei,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,I do too.
21195,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,No.
21196,missandei,7,62,stormborn,- DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS,I want to see you.  Please.
21197,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,It might be useful.  Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.
21198,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,"Archmaester, I wanted to --"
21199,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,And this one.
21200,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,Maester Faol was quite the opposite.  A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
21201,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,I wanted to ask you --
21202,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,"If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research.  If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style.  I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread."
21203,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,What?  You don't like the title?  What would you call it then?
21204,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,Possibly something a bit more poetic?
21205,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,"We're not poets, Tarley."
21206,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,"Archmaester, if I could just have a moment."
21207,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,This is your moment.  Use it wisely.
21208,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.  There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured.  I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.
21209,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.
21210,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,"Oh, you are?"
21211,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,Yes.  Should I tell you how he died?  From Greyscale.
21212,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,Oh.
21213,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,- CITADEL LIBRARY,The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.
21214,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS,Hello.
21215,jorah mormont,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS,What are you doing?
21216,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS,You're Jorah Mormont.  You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.
21217,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS,"My name is Samwell Tarley.  I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black.  I knew your father.  I was with him when he died.  You're not dying today, Ser Jorah."
21218,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS,Drink this.
21219,jorah mormont,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS,What is it?
21220,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS,"Rum.  Drink it all, please.  I'm afraid this is going to hurt."
21221,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS,If you could take off your shirt.
21222,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS,"If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.  I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here.  If they hear you screaming then we're both finished."
21223,jorah mormont,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS,Have you ever done this before?
21224,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS,"No.  No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got.  Have a seat.  I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --"
21225,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS,"Shh,  shhh.  Again, I'm sorry.  Please try not to scream."
21231,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,Ary!
21232,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,"Hello, Hot Pie.  Sit down.  Who's that for?"
21233,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,Mmm.  This is good.
21234,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,You think so?  The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.  Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
21235,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,I didn't do that.
21236,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,You've been making pies?
21237,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,One or two.
21238,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,I can't believe you're here.  Did you meet the big lady?
21239,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,Big lady?
21240,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,The lady knight.  I figured she was a knight because she had armor on.  She was looking for your sister but I told her about you.  Did she ever find you?
21241,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,She found me.
21242,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,What happened to you Ary?
21243,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,You got any ale?
21244,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,Where are you heading?
21245,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,King's Landing.
21246,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,Why?
21247,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,I heard Cersei's queen now.
21248,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,I heard she blew up the Great Sept.  That must have been something to see.  Boom.
21249,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,Hmm.
21250,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,I can't believe someone could do that.
21251,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,Cersei would do that.
21252,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
21253,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,Why would I go there?  The Boltons have it.
21254,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,No.  The Boltons are dead.
21255,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,What?
21256,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards.  He's King in the North now.
21257,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,You're lying.
21258,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,Why would I lie about that?  He's your brother right?
21259,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,Thanks for the pie.
21260,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,Friends don't pay.  I can't believe I thought you were a boy.  You're pretty.
21261,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,Thanks.
21262,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,"Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.  Try not to get killed."
21263,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS,"No, I won't.  I'm like you, Ary.  I'm a survivor."
21264,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - KING'S QUARTERS,Come in.
21265,wolkan,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - KING'S QUARTERS,"A raven, My King, from the Citadel."
21266,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley.  He was my brother at the Night's Watch.  A man I trust as much as anyone in this world.  He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
21267,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone.  It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
21268,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,"He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.  She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.  She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons."
21269,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
21270,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,"We need this Dragonglass, My Lords.  We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army.  We need to mine it and turn it into weapons."
21271,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,"But more importantly, we need allies.  The Night King's army grows larger by the day.  We can't defeat them on our own.  We don't have the numbers.  Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire.  I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.  Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
21272,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?  The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
21273,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,I know that.
21274,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,"She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.  The north is one of those seven kingdoms.  This isn't an invitation, it's a trap."
21275,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,"It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that.  You know him.  He's a good man."
21276,yohn royce,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,"Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa.  I remember the Mad King all too well.  A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister."
21277,robett glover,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,"We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom."
21278,lyanna mormont,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,"Winter is here, Your Grace.  We need the King in the North in the north."
21279,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,"You all crowned me your king.  I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home.  It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds.  But the odds are against us.  None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.  None of you.  We can never hope to defeat them alone.  We need allies, powerful allies.  I know it's a risk.  But I have to take it."
21280,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,Then send an emissary.  Don't go yourself.
21281,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,Daenerys is a queen.  Only a king can convince her to help us.  It has to be me.
21282,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,You're abandoning your people.  Your abandoning your home.
21283,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,I'm leaving both in good hands.
21284,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,Whose?
21285,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL,"Yours.  You are my sister.  You are the only Stark in Winterfell.  Until I return, the north is yours."
21286,petyr baelish,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT,I delivered his bones myself.  I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.  It seems like a lifetime ago.  Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
21287,petyr baelish,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT,"I was sorry when he died.  Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much.  So did I.  She wasn't fond of you, was she?  Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.  Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North.  Last best hope against the coming storm."
21288,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT,You don't belong down here.
21289,petyr baelish,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT,Forgive me.  We have never talked properly.  I wanted to remedy that.
21290,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT,I have nothing to say to you.
21291,petyr baelish,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT,"Not even thank you?  If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield.  You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them.  I love Sansa as I loved her mother."
21292,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT,Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
21293,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,RIVERLANDS_4,Nymeria?
21294,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,RIVERLANDS_4,"Nymeria, it's me, Arya.  I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell.  I'm finally going home.  Come with me."
21295,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,RIVERLANDS_4,Come with me.
21296,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,RIVERLANDS_4,That's not you.
21297,nymeria,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP,You can't have them all.  It's not fair.
21298,obara sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP,I'm oldest.
21299,tyene sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP,Momma will want Cersei for herself.
21300,obara sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP,She's not my momma.  You can have Cersei.  I want The Mountain.
21301,nymeria,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP,The Mountain killed father.  He'll crush you with one hand.
21302,tyene sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP,Father got careless.  That's what Momma says.
21303,obara sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP,"Will you shut up about Momma?  Momma, momma."
21304,tyene sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP,Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.
21305,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,"How can you drink this piss?  When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world.  Have you ever been to Dorne?"
21306,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,A few times.  Never stayed long.
21307,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,A boy in every port?
21308,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,"A boy, a girl.  Depends on the port."
21309,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,Could we get some more?
21310,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,I thought it wasn't for you.
21311,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,I'm developing a taste for it.
21312,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,He's not your servant.
21313,theon greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,It's fine.
21314,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,"So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands."
21315,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,Once I kill my uncle.
21316,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,"And what will you be, handsome?"
21317,theon greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,Whatever my queen demands.
21318,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,"He'll be my advisor, my protector."
21319,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,"Oh, I see.  Your protector."
21320,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,So if someone gets too close to you --
21321,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,He might have to intervene.
21322,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,-- hold that person back.
21323,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,Until they've made their intentions known.
21324,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,Why are you standing all the way over there then?  A foreign invasion is under way.  It seems like you don't need a protector.
21325,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,Stay here.

21386,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"Forgive me, Ser Davos.  I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen.  Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity.  But do I have my facts wrong?"
21387,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"I wasn't there, Your Grace."
21388,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"No.  Of course not.  But still, an oath is an oath.  In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?"

21390,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"Forever.  So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee."
21391,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,I am not.
21392,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"Oh.  Well, that is unfortunate.  You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?"
21393,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,Break faith?  Your father burned my grandfather alive.  He burned my uncle alive.  He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
21394,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"My father was an evil man.  On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family.  And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father.  Our two houses were allies for centuries.  Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known.  Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.  I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.  Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.  Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.  Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
21395,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,You're right.  You're not guilty of your father's crime.  And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
21396,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,Then why are you here?
21397,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,Because I need your help and you need mine.
21398,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
21399,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,I did.
21400,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?"
21401,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,They're hard to miss.
21402,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"But still, I need your help?"
21403,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"Not to defeat Cersei.  You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.  Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."
21404,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,Almost.
21405,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,But you haven't stormed King's Landing.  Why not?  The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.  It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it.  Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
21406,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
21407,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair."
21408,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,You told me you liked this man.
21409,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,I do.
21410,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child."
21411,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,I believe he's calling all of us children.  Figure of speech.
21412,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north."
21413,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north."
21414,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,I am not your enemy.  The dead are the enemy.
21415,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,The dead?
21416,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,Is that another figure of speech?
21417,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,The Army of the Dead is on the march.
21418,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,The Army of the Dead?
21419,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
21420,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"No, I don't think you're either of those things."
21421,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,The Army of the Dead is real.  The White Walkers are real.  The Knight King is real.  I've seen them.  If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --
21422,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,-- we're finished.
21423,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,I was born at Dragonstone.  Not that I can remember it.
21424,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.  Robert was your father's best friend, no?  I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib.  Not that it matters now of course.  I spent my life in foreign lands.  So many men have tried to kill me.  I don't remember all of their names.  I have been sold like a brood mare.  I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled.  Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile?  Faith.  Not in any gods.  Not in myths and legends.  In myself.  In Daenerys Targaryen.  The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born.  The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea.  Any sea."
21425,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,They did for me.  I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.  And I will.
21426,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.
21427,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,The war against my sister has already begun.  You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --
21428,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,-- whatever you saw beyond the wall.
21429,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,You don't believe him.  I understand that.  It sounds like nonsense.
21430,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.  You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros.  He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen.  He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.  He was named King in the North.  Not because of his birthright.  He has no birthright.  He's a damn bastard.  All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him."
21431,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things.  He fought those things for the good of his people.  He risked his life for his people.  He took a knife in the heart for his people.  He gave his own --"
21432,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die.  And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
21433,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.
21434,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys.  Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.
21435,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,There's no time for that.  There's no time for any of this.  While we stand here debating --
21436,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,It takes no time to bend the knee.  Pledge your sword to her cause.
21437,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,And why would I do that?
21438,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you.  As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name.  And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.  The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them.  And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
21439,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"That's fair.  It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion."
21440,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,You must forgive my manners.  You will both be tired after your long journey.  We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
21441,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,Am I your prisoner?
21442,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,Not yet.
21443,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.
21444,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,And?
21445,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,Two or three ships escaped.  The rest sunk our captured.  Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured.  The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
21446,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,All of them?
21448,theon greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,SEA OF DORNE_2,Euron has her.
21450,theon greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,SEA OF DORNE_2,I couldn't save her.  I tried.
21452,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,KING'S LANDING - STREETS,This is the life.  Look at them.  Cheering for a Greyjoy.
21453,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,KING'S LANDING - STREETS,"I have to be honest, it's making me hard.  Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?"
21454,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,KING'S LANDING - STREETS,Oh no!
21455,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,KING'S LANDING - STREETS,What a twat.
21456,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,My queen.  Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.
21457,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,I give you --
21458,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,-- what no other man could give.  Justice.  Justice for your murdered daughter.
21459,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.
21460,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,A bit more than a true friend.
21461,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
21462,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,There's only one reward I want.
21463,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,You shall have what your heart desires --
21464,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,-- when the war is won.
21465,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,"With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country."
21466,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,"There's nothing quite like it, is there?  The love of the people.  I suppose you wouldn't know."
21467,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,"This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
21468,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,"Or yours.  They just like severed heads really.  Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers."
21469,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,Advice?
21470,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,Does she like it gentle or rough?  A finger in the bum?
21471,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_2,"Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now.  We'll talk later."
21472,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"I want you to know I understand.  Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you.  I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head.  I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking."
21473,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"The sound of your scream.  I never heard a sound like that.  I thought, that's true love.  Oberyn looked beautiful that day.  He really did.  No one moved like him.  No one had such skill with a spear.  Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.  If only he hadn't taunted him.  He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.  But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?  Now he's burried somewhere.  And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever.  That must be difficult for you.  When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child.  I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse.  I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms.  I never got to have a mother.  But Myrcella did.  She was mine and you took her from me.  Why did you do that?"
21474,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,It doesn't matter now.
21475,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"Your daughter is a beauty too.  Brown eyes, those lips.  A perfect Dornish beauty."
21476,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,I imagine she is your favorite.
21477,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites.  But still, we're only human.  We love who we love."
21478,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,I'm sorry.  I can't understand you.  The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying.  It must be frustrating.
21479,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,We all make our choices.  You chose to murder my daughter.  You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
21480,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"Do you feel powerful now?  I don't sleep very well, not at all really.  I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies.  How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter.  I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's.  It would be poetic I suppose but fast.  Too fast."
21481,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
21482,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"She's so beautiful.  The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right."
21483,tyene sand,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,Momma!
21484,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know.  Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.  The long goodbye, was that it?"
21485,qyburn,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,The Long Farewell.
21486,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,That's the one.
21487,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,How long does the poison take?
21488,qyburn,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"Difficult to say.  Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution."
21489,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,But death is certain?
21490,qyburn,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain."
21491,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,"Your daughter will die here in this cell.  You will be here watching when she does.  You will be here the rest of your days.  If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat.  You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made."
21492,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS,Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.  I don't want her to miss a thing.
21493,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS,No.
21494,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS,Don't.
21495,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS,What are you doing?  No one can see us like this ?
21496,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS,I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  I'll do as I please.
21498,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS,Good.  And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
21500,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,"No, thank you."
21501,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,"My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son.  From all reports he was a fine young man."
21502,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.
21503,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,Condolences and congratulations.  You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms.  That's quite an accomplishment.  The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.
21504,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
21505,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,Indeed.  But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.
21506,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
21507,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,"Your father never minced words either.  But, yes, your debts are considerable.  And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts.  We both know how expensive war can be."
21508,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,And we both know gold wins wars.  Your vaults are empty.  Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.
21509,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies.  You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
21510,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
21511,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,We don't make bets.  We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
21512,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,That's a fancy way of saying bet.  The war has already begun.  I've drawn first blood.  I decapitated the Dornish snake.  My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
21513,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
21514,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
21515,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,For now.  Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons.  How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
21516,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,"Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.  Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl.  You want to invest in her?  I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade.  How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
21517,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,"The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true."
21518,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch.  In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
21519,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts.  Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
21520,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,Your father's daughter indeed.
21521,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM,Give me a fortnight.  Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.
21522,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.  You're making it difficult.  You look a lot better brooding than I do.  You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
21523,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,I'm a prisoner on this island.
21524,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,"I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.  You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
21525,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,Except to my ship.  They took my ship.
21526,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,I wouldn't say we took your ship.
21527,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,I'm not playing word games with you.  The dead are coming for us all.
21528,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,"Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
21529,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,It's hard for me to fathom.  It really is.  If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
21530,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,You probably don't believe me.
21531,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,I do actually.
21532,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,You didn't before.  Grumpkins and snarks you called them.  Do you remember?  You said it was all nonsense.
21533,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,"It was all nonsense.  Everybody knew it.  But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
21534,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
21535,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,Good question.
21536,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,I know it's a good question.  I'm looking for an answer.
21537,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,"People's minds aren't made for problems that large.  White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
21538,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.  I can't help them from here.  I'd like to leave.
21539,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
21540,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,"Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.  Don't go south.  Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader.  And here I am.  A northern fool."
21541,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,"Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us.  And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye.  Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't.  Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now.  While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter.  She protects people from monsters, just as you do.  That's why she came here.  And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting.  That's not a reasonable thing to ask."
21542,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,So do you have anything reasonable to ask?
21543,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,What do you mean?
21544,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,Maybe you are a northern fool.  I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
21545,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Dragonglass?
21546,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"Yes.  Volcanic glass, obsidian.  He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
21547,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Why are we talking about glass?  We just lost two of our allies.
21548,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
21549,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
21550,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them.  I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
21551,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
21552,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
21553,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Which wise man said this?
21554,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,I don't remember.
21555,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
21556,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"I would never do that...to you.  The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.  All of his advisors would have told him not to come.  I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway.  You don't have to believe him.  Let him mine the Dragonglass.  If he's wrong it's worthless.  You didn't even know it was here.  It's nothing to you.  Give him something by giving him nothing.  Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally.  Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand.  Casterly Rock."
21557,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people?  Did you notice that?
21558,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,You must allow them their flights of fancy.  It's dreary in the north.
21559,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,Amazing thing to see.
21560,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.
21561,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,You lost two brothers as well?
21562,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are.  Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
21563,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,You've been talking to Tyrion?
21564,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,He is my Hand.
21565,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,He enjoys talking.
21566,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,We all enjoy what we're good at.
21567,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,I don't.
21568,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
21569,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,I never expected that you would.
21570,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
21571,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,I haven't either.
21572,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it.  Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
21573,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,Thank you.
21574,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
21575,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS,"You better get to work, Jon Snow."
21576,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,How much do we have?
21577,wolkan,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"4,000 bushels, My Lady."
21578,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,What does that mean?
21579,yohn royce,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more."
21580,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
21581,wolkan,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,I'm not entirely certain.  I'll check Maester Llewyn's records.  He kept a copy of every raven scroll.
21582,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell."
21583,wolkan,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"No, My Lady, most likely not."
21584,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"We must prepare for that eventuality.  Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be.  We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north.  If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them."
21585,yohn royce,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"Very wise, My Lady."
21586,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?"
21587,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
21588,yohn royce,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"No, My Lady."
21589,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?"
21590,yohn royce,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"They should indeed.  Pardon me, My Lady."
21591,yohn royce,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"You there, why isn't there leather on these?"
21592,petyr baelish,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,Command suits you.  The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
21593,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,So they should be.
21594,petyr baelish,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,I know Cersei better than anyone here.  If you turn your back on her --
21595,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
21596,petyr baelish,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,I only meant to say --
21597,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous?  Thank you for your wise council."
21598,petyr baelish,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"One of two things will happen.  Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end.  Or life will win out.  And what then?"
21599,petyr baelish,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"Don't fight in the north or the south.  Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind.  Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once.  Live that way and nothing will surprise you.  Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."
21601,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_5,"Hello, Sansa."
21602,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,I wish Jon was here.
21603,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,Yes.  I need to speak to him.
21604,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,Your father's last living true born son.  You're Lord of Winterfell.
21605,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,I can never be the Lord of Winterfell.  I can never be lord of anything.  I'm the three-eyed raven.
21606,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,I don't know what that means.
21607,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,It's difficult to explain.
21608,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,"Try, please, for me."
21609,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,"It means I can see everything.  Everything that's ever happened to everyone.  Everything that's happening right now.  It's all pieces, fragments.  I need to learn to see better.  When the long night comes again I need to be ready."
21610,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,How do you know all of this?
21611,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,The three-eyed raven taught me.
21612,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,I thought you were the three-eyed raven.
21613,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,I told you it's difficult to explain.
21614,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,Bran --
21615,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.  I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home.  It was so beautiful that night.  Snow falling just like now.  And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.
21616,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,"I have to go back inside, Bran."
21617,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE,I'll stay a bit longer.
21618,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,Hmm.
21619,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,Hmm.  Does it hurt?
21620,jorah mormont,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,A bit.  Less than before.
21621,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,The infection no longer appears to be active.
21622,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,Unusual.  Unlikely.  One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.
21623,jorah mormont,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,I don't know anything about that.  I just started feeling better.  I assumed it was the rest that did it.
21624,jorah mormont,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,And the climate.
21625,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"The climate?  You're free to go, Ser.  This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer."
21626,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening."
21627,jorah mormont,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,How bad is it?
21628,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,I suppose I'll find out this evening.
21629,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,Where will you go?
21630,jorah mormont,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.  I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could.  Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.  The only place for me is with her.
21631,jorah mormont,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,I owe my life to her and you.
21632,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,Your father saved me more than once.  It's the least I could do.
21633,jorah mormont,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,Perhaps our paths will cross again?
21634,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,I hope they do.
21635,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,You treated him?
21636,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,Yes.
21637,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,Who told you to treat him?
21638,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,No one.
21639,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
21640,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,I seem to remember you.
21641,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,But you treated him anyway?
21642,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,I did.
21643,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,"I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful.  Especially on someone of that age.  You could have infected yourself and others.  You could have devastated the entire Citadel.  But you didn't.  It's a meticulous, difficult procedure.  Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed.  But you succeeded.  How?"
21644,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,I read the books and followed the instructions.
21645,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,That man is alive because of you.  You should be proud.
21646,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,"Thank you, Archmaester."
21647,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,Come here.
21648,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away.  I need you to make copies of them.
21649,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY,You were expecting a reward?  Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.  You'd better get started.  Be mindful of the paper mites.  They like flesh as well.
21650,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_2,We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
21651,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_2,"Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet.  To send our remaining ships after him --"
21652,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_2,I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
21653,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_2,But you'll have to go yourself.  Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place.  You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
21654,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_2,"I wouldn't be alone.  I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal.  What can anyone do to them?"
21655,missandei,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_2,They can still do something to you.  It only takes one arrow.
21656,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_2,It's too great a risk.  You're too important.
21657,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_2,What about Casterly Rock?
21658,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_2,The Unsullied will be there soon.
21659,missandei,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_2,And what will they face?
21660,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_2,A difficult situation.  They know we're coming.
21661,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_2,Yes.  Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister.  She will be ready.
21662,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK,No one has ever taken the rock.
21663,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK,"The Lannister army is still the army my father built.  Well trained and well provisioned.  10,000 men at least.  They will see us coming."
21664,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK,They will be ready.
21666,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK,The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
21667,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK,The fight up the walls will be hard.  We'll be at a disadvantage.  Many men will die.
21668,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,"Interesting thing about my father.  He built our house up from near ruin.  He built our army.  He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers.  That was beneath him.  So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find.  Me.  He was right.  I was low.  The company I kept low, women mostly.  They weren't welcome at the Rock.  Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.  I couldn't walk them through the front gates.  I couldn't have them in my chambers.  So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself."
21669,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS,It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
21670,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS,"No better place for low pursuits.  Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress."
21671,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS,"As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."""
21672,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS,And so it begins.  They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.  They will be outnumbered.  They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
21673,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS,"But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.  They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them.  They will be fighting for you.  And that is why they will triump."
21675,grey worm,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS,There are supposed to be more than this.  Many more.
21676,grey worm,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS,Where are they?  Where are the rest of the Lannisters?
21677,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,It's done?
21678,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,It is.
21679,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,And now the rains weep for our whores.  Did we fight well?
21680,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,I suppose as well as can be expected.
21681,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,It was never our forte.  Golden roses indeed.  Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
21682,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,"The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.  Well, it is to me.  My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne."
21683,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,So you'll just let them take it?
21684,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,"For now.  They won't be able to hold it.  Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left.  Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros."
21685,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,"And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?"
21686,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.  There are always lessons in failures.
21687,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,Yes.  You must be very wise by now.
21688,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,My father always said I was a slow learner.
21689,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,"If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry?  I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.  No more learning from my mistakes, eh?  How will you do it?  With that sword?"
21690,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,"That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?  Not that he ever used it.  What did he call it?"
21691,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,Widow's Wail.
21692,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,"He really was a cunt, wasn't he?  I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders.  I never lost a night's sleep over them.  They were necessary.  And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did.  But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining.  That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination.  She's a monster, you do know that?"
21693,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,"To you, sure.  To others as well.  But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
21694,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,You love her.  You really do love her.  You poor fool.  She'll be the end of you.
21695,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,"Possibly.  Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?"
21696,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,What better person to discuss it with?  What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room?  But perhaps you're right.  If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.

21701,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,Cersei had several ideas.  Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.  Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.  I talked her out of those.
21702,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,Will there be pain?
21703,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,No.  I made sure of that.
21704,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,That's good.
21705,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS,"I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple.  It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father.  It was horrible enough for me.  A shocking scene.  Not at all what I intended.  You see, I'd never seen the posion work before.  Tell Cersei.  I want her to know it was me."

21866,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_6,They were here together the Children and the First Men.
21867,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_6,Doing what?  Fighting each other?
21868,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_6,"They fought together against their common enemy.  Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together.  We need to do the same if we're going to survive."
21869,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_6,Because the enemy is real.  It's always been real.
21870,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_6,And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
21871,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_6,"No, I don't think I can."
21872,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_6,I will fight for you.  I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
21873,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_6,"My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered."
21874,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_6,They will if their king does.  They chose you to lead them.  They chose you to protect them.  Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
21875,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_6,What is it?
21876,tyrion lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_6,We took Casterly Rock.
21877,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_6,That's very good to hear.
21878,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_6,Isn't it?
21879,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.  Perhaps --
21880,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,You will stay.  All my allies are gone.  They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
21881,tyrion lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,We still have the largest army.
21882,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
21883,tyrion lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.  We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.  Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.  We have a plan.  It's still the right plan.
21884,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,"The right plan?  Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach."
21885,tyrion lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,If I've underestimated our enemies --
21886,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,"Our enemies?  Your family, you mean.  Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all."
21887,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,Enough with the clever plans.
21888,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,I have three large dragons.  I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
21889,tyrion lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,We've discussed this.
21890,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,My enemies are in the Red Keep.  What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
21891,tyrion lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,A smart one.
21892,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,What do you think I should do?
21893,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,I would never presume to --
21894,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,I'm at war.  I'm losing.
21895,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,What do you think I should do?
21896,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,I never thought that dragons would exist again.  No one did.  The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen.  Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen.  Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
21897,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_1,"But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different.  You're just more of the same."
21898,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,Don't lunge.
21899,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,Don't go where your enemy leads you.
21900,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,Up.
21901,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,And don't --
21902,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
21903,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,Nice sword.  Very nice dagger.
21904,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --
21905,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,It's been awhile since I've trained.
21906,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,"I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady."
21907,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,He didn't beat the hound.  You did.  I want to train with you.
21908,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,"You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?"
21909,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,"Move aside, Podrick."
21910,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,"You can't use that, My Lady.  It's too small."
21911,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,I won't cut you.  Don't worry.
21912,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,I'll try not to.
21913,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,Who taught you to do that?
21914,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_6,No one.
21915,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,What do you think of her?
21916,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,Who?
21917,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,I believe you know of whom I speak.
21918,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,I think she has a good heart.
21919,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,A good heart?  I've noticed you starring at that good heart.
21920,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,"There's no time for that.  I saw the Night King, Davos.  I looked into his eyes.  How many men do we have in the north to fight him?  10,000?  Less?"
21921,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,Fewer.
21922,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,What?
21923,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,"Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth."
21924,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,"Ser Davos, Lord Snow."
21925,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,"King Snow, isn't it?  No?  That doesn't sound right.  King Jon?"
21926,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,It doesn't matter.
21927,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,"Forgive me, but may I ask a question?"
21928,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,Of course.
21929,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,"Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?"
21930,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,I'm a bastard.  My mother and father weren't married.
21931,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,Is the custom different in Naarth?
21932,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
21933,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,The sounds liberating.
21934,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,Why did you leave your homeland?
21935,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,I was stolen away by slavers.
21936,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,I'm sorry.
21937,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,"If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?"
21938,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,She bought me from my master and set me free.
21939,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,"That was good of her.  Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?"
21940,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.  Because I believe in her.
21941,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --
21942,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.
21943,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,You believe that?
21944,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,"I know it.  All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her.  She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew.  She's the queen we chose."
21945,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,You'll forgive me if I switch sides.
21946,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_7,Is that a Greyjoy ship?
21947,theon greyjoy,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_2,Jon.  I didn't know you were here.
21948,theon greyjoy,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_2,"Sansa, is she all right?"
21949,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_2,What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.
21950,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_2,We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.  We thought you were dead.
21951,theon greyjoy,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_2,I should be.
21952,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_2,Your sister?
21953,theon greyjoy,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_2,Euron has her.  I came to ask the queen to help get her back.
21954,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_2,The queen is gone.
21955,theon greyjoy,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_2,Where did she go?
21956,randyll tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,All of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.
21957,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,Good.
21958,randyll tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,"We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall.  If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time."
21959,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,We are stretched a bit thin.
21960,randyll tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,"With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility."
21961,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,Let's give them fair warning first.  These men fought well at Highgarden.
21962,dickon tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,Ser Jaime.

21966,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,And?
21967,dickon tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,It was glorious.
21968,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,Come on.  Your father's not here.
21969,dickon tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,All my life we've been pledged to House Tyrell.  I knew some of those men.  I hunted with them.
21970,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,They didn't deserve to die.  But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl.  So here we are.
21971,dickon tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,I didn't expect it to smell like that.
21972,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,Men shit themselves when they die.  Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?
21973,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,"Well, I learned it when I was 5."
21974,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS,What?

22026,randyll tarly,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND,Step back and shut your mouth.
22027,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND,Who are you?
22028,randyll tarly,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND,A stupid boy.
22029,dickon tarly,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND,"I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley."
22030,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND,You are the future of your house.  This war has already wiped one great house from the world.  Don't let it happen again.  Bend the knee.
22031,dickon tarly,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND,I will not.
22032,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND,"Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell."
22033,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND,I meant what I said.  I'm not here to put men in chains.  If that becomes an option many will take it.  I gave them a choice.  They made it.
22034,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND,"Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
22035,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND,I'm not beheading anyone.
22036,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND,Your Grace --
22037,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND,"Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die."
22038,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND,Dracarys.
22039,qyburn,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,My Lord.
22040,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,How many men did we lose?
22041,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,We haven't done a full counting.
22042,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,"It's armies that win wars.  We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us.  We can buy mercenaries."
22043,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,"They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be."
22044,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,"I just saw the Dothraki fight.  They'll beat any mercenary army.  They'll beat any army I've ever seen.  Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.  Her dragon burned a thousand wagons.  Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.  They couldn't stop it.  And she has three of them.  This isn't a war we can win."
22045,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,"So what do we do?  Sue for peace?  I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered.  And in her mind she's winning.  What sort of offer do you think she'd make?"
22046,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
22047,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,He didn't.
22048,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,"You saw the crossbow, you saw his body."
22049,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,I'm not talking about father.  Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.  He had nothing to do with it.
22050,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,After all this time it still amazes me --
22051,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,It was Olenna.  She confessed before she died.
22052,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
22053,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,After.
22054,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,And you believed her?
22055,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen?  Which one would Margerey been better able to control?  Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?  She was telling the truth.
22056,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,I shouldn't have listened to you.  She should have died screaming.
22057,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,"She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house.  And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them."
22058,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY,So we fight and die or we submit and die.  I know my choice.  A soldier should know his.
22059,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
22060,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,"That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are.  Gorgeous beasts."
22061,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,"They're not beasts to me.  No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children."
22062,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,You weren't gone long.
22063,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,No.
22064,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,And?
22065,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
22066,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,You're not sure how you feel about that?
22067,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,"No, I'm not."
22068,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
22069,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,Thousands.
22070,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,We both want to help people.  We can only help them from a position of strength.  Sometimes strength is terrible.  When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
22071,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,Ser Davos gets carried away.
22072,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,So it was a figure of speech?
22074,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,He is my friend.
22075,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,Your Grace.
22076,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,"Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend."
22077,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,I served with your father.  He was a great man.
22078,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,You look strong.  You found a cure?
22079,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,"I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.  I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
22080,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS,It would be my honor.
22081,bran stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_2,Ravens.  We need to send ravens.
22083,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,I remember Wolkan.   A bit timid but a sharp mind.
22086,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,It is a bit much.  Still we ought to --
22087,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,Brandon Stark --
22088,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,-- the crippled boy.
22089,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,Do you know him?
22090,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,I let him through the Wall years ago.  I saw him go beyond the wall.
22091,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,And?
22092,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,"Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could.  Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one.  Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say."
22094,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.
22095,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,"Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.  If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it.  If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it.  And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good."
22096,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,It could be done.  And this news could be authentic.  It's possible.  It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.
22098,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,"Archmaester, please.  It's real.  I've seen it."
22099,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification.  I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
22100,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,Archmaester --
22101,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,"That will be all, Tarley."
22105,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,I'm afraid so.
22107,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,I don't have the heart to tell him yet.  He's a good lad.
22108,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER,Right.  The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...
22109,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_2,All rulers demand that people bend the knee.  It's why they're rulers.  She gave Tarley a choice.  A man who had taken up arms against her.  What else could she do?
22110,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_2,Not burn him alive alongside his son.
22111,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_2,"I am her hand, not her head.  I can't make her decisions for her."
22112,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_2,That's what I used to tell myself about her father.  I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive.  I was only a purveyor of information.
22113,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_2,"It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it.""  As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it.""  When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it."""
22114,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_2,Daenerys is not her father.
22115,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_2,And she never will be... with the right counsel.  You need to find a way to make her listen.
22116,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_2,Who is that for?
22117,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_2,Jon Snow.
22118,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_2,Did you read it?
22119,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_2,It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
22120,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_2,What's it say?
22121,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_2,Nothing good.
22122,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,I thought Arya was dead.  I thought Bran was dead.
22123,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,I'm happy for you.  You don't look happy.
22124,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch.  If they make it past the wall --
22125,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years.  Presumably --
22126,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,I need to go home.
22127,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,You said you don't have enough men.
22128,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,We'll fight with the men we have.  Unless you'll join us.
22129,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,And give the country to Cersei?  As soon as I march away she marches in.
22130,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,Perhaps not.  Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children.  What if we prove her wrong?
22131,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
22132,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,So bring the dead to her.
22133,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
22134,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,We don't have to bring the whole army.  Only one soldier.
22135,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,Is that possible?
22136,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
22137,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
22138,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
22139,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,The only person she listens to is Jaime.  He may listen to me.
22140,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,And how would you get into King's Landing.
22141,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,"I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter."
22142,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,"Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men."
22143,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,Fair point.  How do you propose to find one?
22144,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
22145,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.  Allow me to serve you.
22146,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,The free folk will help us.  They know the real north better than anyone.
22147,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,They won't follow Ser Jorah.
22148,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,They won't have to.
22149,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,You can't lead a raid beyond the wall.  You're not in the Night's Watch anymore.  You're King in the North.
22150,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,I'm the only one here whose fought them.  I'm the only one here who knows them.
22151,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,I haven't given you permission to leave.
22152,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_4,"With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.  I am a king.  And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive.  I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people.  Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance."
22153,robett glover,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - THE GREAT HALL,"The King in the North should stay in the north.  We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have."
22154,yohn royce,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - THE GREAT HALL,"The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark."
22155,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - THE GREAT HALL,"You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king.  He is doing what he thinks is best."
22156,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,I warned Jon this would happen.  He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
22157,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,He didn't.  He trusted you to hold it for him.
22158,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,"Well, he's not making it easy.  The northern lords are proud."
22159,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,These are mother and father's chambers.
22160,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,And?
22161,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,Nothing.
22162,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,Don't do that.
22163,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,What?
22164,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,Say what you mean.
22165,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,You always liked nice things.  It made you feel better than everyone.
22166,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,Are you angry with me?
22167,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
22168,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,"I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell."
22169,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,Their opinions are important to you?
22170,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,"Glover has 500 men.  Royce has 2,000.  Offend them and Jon loses his army."
22171,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,Not if they lose their heads first.
22172,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,"Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands.  We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together.  Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together."
22173,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,"And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want."
22174,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,How can you even think such a horrible thing?
22175,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,"You're thinking it right now.  You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away."
22176,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,I have work to do.
22177,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS,My lady.
22178,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH,Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
22179,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH,Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.
22180,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH,There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.  The guards hardly ever patrol it.  Too many steps.
22181,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH,You're not staying here?
22182,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH,I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
22183,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH,What if someone takes the boat?
22184,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH,Then we're fucked.  Best hurry.
22185,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,We don't have time for this.  We should be preparing the city for a siege.  The Dothraki are coming.
22186,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,All the more reason for you to train.  Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
22187,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
22188,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,And here I am ready to train.
22189,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,Why down here?
22190,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
22191,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
22192,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,"Oh, you won't be swinging it at me."
22193,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,I'll leave you to it.
22194,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
22195,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,"You made me look like a complete fool.  I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me.  You abandoned the family home.  Completely unsentimental.  Father would have been proud."
22196,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,Don't talk about our father.
22197,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,Listen to me --
22198,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
22199,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
22200,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,"He was going to execute me.  He knew I was innocent.  He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am.  The little monster sent to punish him.  Do you think I wanted to be born this way?  Did he think I chose --"
22201,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,What do you want?
22202,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,Daenerys will win this war.  You're a military man.  You must know there is no way around it.  Daenerys is not her father.  She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
22203,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
22204,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS,I -- I don't.  Daenerys doesn't.  Not right now anyway.  She has a more important request.
22205,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,I wasn't sure I'd find you.
22206,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,I thought you might still be rowing.
22207,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,"I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.  I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel."
22208,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
22209,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,I haven't been here in years.  Why should they recognize me?  Sometimes I hardly do.  Nothing fucks you harder than time.
22210,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,Anybody give you any trouble?
22211,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,Here I am arming Lannisters.  I never get a second look.  You were right.  Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
22212,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,Don't be so sure.  Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.  Bad things are coming.
22213,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,You came to get me.  You want me to come with you.
22214,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,I think you need to understand --
22215,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,I'm ready.  Let's go.
22216,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,You should know what you're heading into.
22217,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father?  They tried to kill me.
22218,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,"I've been getting ready.  I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes."
22219,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,You might want to bring one of those swords.
22220,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,"I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --"
22221,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM,-- this I know.
22222,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,Keep your father's name to yourself.  The situation is complicated enough already.
22223,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,Who should I say I am?
22224,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,"I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --"
22226,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,"No weapons, friends.  I promise.  What can I do for you?"
22228,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,It is.
22230,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,That they are.  I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.
22231,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,Still five gold dragons?
22234,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,15?
22236,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
22238,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,Not more gold.
22243,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,Come and have a look.
22244,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,Fermented crab.
22246,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,"Fermented crab.  One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week.  A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.  Five minutes later, he's back in the race.  Here, have a taste."
22247,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.
22249,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.
22252,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,Fish hook.  Some men you just can't teach.
22254,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,Perhaps there's some arrangement?
22256,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,This is Gendry.
22257,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,He'll do.
22258,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,That won't be necessary.
22259,qyburn,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,Ser Jaime.
22260,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,Why was QYBURN here?
22261,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,He's Hand of the Queen.  Why are you here?
22262,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,I met with Tyrion.
22263,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,What did our brother have to say?
22264,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,Daenerys wants to meet.
22265,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,To discuss a surrender?
22266,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,To discuss an armistice.
22267,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,She just won a great victory.  Why would she want a truce now?
22268,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.  Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
22269,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,Are you going to punish him?
22270,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,Tyrion?
22271,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,Bronn.
22272,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,He betrayed you.  He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent.  Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
22273,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,You let it happen.  Why?
22274,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,"I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest.  She has the numbers.  If we want to beat her we have to be clever.  We have to fight her like father would have.  Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house.  For this."
22275,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,Who will you say is the father?
22276,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,You.
22277,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,People won't like that.
22278,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,Do you remember what father used to say about people?
22279,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
22280,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS,Never betray me again.
22281,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,We're leaving today.  The king's got a lot on his mind.
22282,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,I understand.
22283,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
22284,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,You don't have to worry.
22285,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges."
22286,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,Understood.
22287,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"Begging your pardon, Your Grace."
22288,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,You survived King's Landing.
22289,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,Yet again.
22290,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"Your Grace, this is --"
22291,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"It's Gendry, Your Grace.  I'm Robert Baratheon's son.  Bastard son."
22292,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,He was meant to keep that to himself.
22293,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,Our fathers trusted each other.  Why shouldn't we?
22294,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,I saw your father once at Winterfell.
22295,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,I met yours in my shop.
22296,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,You're a lot leaner.
22297,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,You're a lot shorter.
22298,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,I grew up on stories about them.
22299,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"All I ever knew was they fought together and won.  Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why.  Let me come with you."
22300,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,Don't be a fool.  You're not a soldier.
22301,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"No, but I'm a fighter.  And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that."
22302,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,Do you know how to use one?
22303,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"Well, that's a problem."
22304,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,I prefer a hammer.
22305,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,He can handle himself.
22306,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,We could use the help.
22307,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life."
22308,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"I owe you my life.  Twice over.  But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war."
22309,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,Yeah.  Nobody mind me.  All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
22310,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_4,"You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont.  Nobody glowers quite like you.  Not even Grey Worm."
22311,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_4,This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us.  Remember?
22312,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_4,It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
22313,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_4,Take it with you.  You'll bring it back.  Our queen needs you.
22314,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_4,We should be better at saying farewell by now.
22315,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_4,"Your Grace, I --"
22316,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_4,If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.
22317,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_4,But I've grown used to him.
22318,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_4,"I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace."
22319,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_4,Heave!
22320,gilly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS,Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?
22321,sam,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS,No.
22322,gilly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS,"15,782."
22323,gilly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS,Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.
22324,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS,None anymore.
22325,gilly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS,"That's true.  This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything.  He even recorded his own bowel movements.  What does ""annulment"" mean?"
22326,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS,It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
22327,gilly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS,Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne.  Is that a common thing --
22328,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS,"These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored.  But that's all right, isn't it.  We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynard's 15,782 shits."
22329,gilly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS,Steps.  That number was steps.
22330,gilly,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. CITADEL,Are you sure you want to do this?  You always wanted to be a maester.
22331,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. CITADEL,I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.
22332,wolkan,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,"I found it, my Lord."
22333,wolkan,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,It took some searching.  Maester Llewyn's archives are thorough.
22334,petyr baelish,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?
22335,wolkan,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,"Yes, my Lord."
22336,petyr baelish,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,Lady Stark thanks you for your service.
22338,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?
22339,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,I've been failing at that job of late.
22340,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,How many queens are there now?
22341,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,Two.
22342,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?
22343,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,Both.
22344,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,How many men did you bring?
22345,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,Not enough.
22346,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,The big woman?
22347,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,We were hoping some of your men could help.
22348,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,I'll be staying behind.  I'm a liability out there as you well know.
22349,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,You are.
22350,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,You really want to go out there again?
22351,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL,You're not the only ones.
22352,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall.  Said they were on their way here.
22353,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,You're The Hound.  I saw you once at Winterfell.
22354,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,They want to go beyond the Wall too.
22355,beric dondarrion,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,"We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to.  Our lord told us the great war is coming."
22356,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,Don't trust them.  Don't trust any of them.
22357,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,They're the Brotherhood.  And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.
22358,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,Thoros?
22359,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,I hardly recognized you.
22360,thoros,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,Ser Jorah Mormont --
22361,thoros,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,They won't give me anything to drink down here.  I haven't been feeling like myself.
22362,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,You're a fucking Mormont?  Like the last Lord Commander?
22363,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,He was my father.
22364,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,He hunted us like animals.
22365,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,"You returned the favor, as I recall."
22366,beric dondarrion,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.
22367,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,Our reasons aren't your reasons.
22368,beric dondarrion,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
22369,beric dondarrion,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not.  We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --
22370,sandor clegane,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,"For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole.  Are we coming with you or not?"
22371,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,Don't you want to know what we're doing?
22372,thoros,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?
22373,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,He's right.  We're all on the same side.
22374,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,How can we be?
22375,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS,We're all breathing.
22376,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,Are you all right?
22377,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,Ever been north before?
22378,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,Never seen snow before.
22379,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,"Beautiful, eh?  I can breath again.  Down south the air smells like pig shit."
22380,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,You've never been down south.
22381,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,I've been to Winterfell.
22382,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,That's the north.
22383,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,How do you live up here?  How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
22384,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,"You have to keep moving.  That's the secret.  Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best."
22385,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
22386,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,We have to make due with what we've got.
22387,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,This one is maybe not so smart.
22388,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,Davos says he is a strong fighter.
22389,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,Good.  That's more important than being smart.
22390,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,"Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead.  So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?  And?"
22391,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
22392,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,"You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling.  Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man.  The king beyond the wall never bent the knee.  How many of his people died for his pride?"
22393,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,"Are you still mad at us, boy?"
22394,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,You sold me to a witch.
22395,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,"Priestess.  I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction."
22396,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,We're fighting a great war.  Wars cost money.
22397,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,"I wanted to be one of you.  I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave.  Do you know what she did to me?  She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --"
22398,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,Sounds all right so far.
22399,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,-- and put leeches on me.
22400,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,Was she naked too?
22401,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,She needed your blood.
22402,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,Yes. Thank you.  I know that.
22403,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,It could have been worse.
22404,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,She wanted to kill me.  They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
22405,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,"But they didn't, did they?  So what you whinging about?"
22406,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,I'm not whinging.
22407,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.  That's whinging.
22408,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,This one's been killed six times.  You don't hear him bitching about it.
22409,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,Good lad.
22410,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
22411,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,He was a good man.  He deserved a better son.  Were you with him at the end?
22412,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,I was a prisoner of the Wildlings.  But we avenged him.  I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
22413,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,"I can't think of a worse way for him to go.  The Night's Watch was his life.  He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him."
22414,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,I hate that he died that way.  My father was the most honorable man I ever met.  He was good all the way through.  And he died on the executioner's block.
22415,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,Your father wanted to execute me.
22416,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,I heard.
22417,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,He was in the right of course.  It didn't make me hate him any less.
22418,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,I'm glad he didn't capture you.
22419,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,Me too.
22420,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,"Your father gave me this sword.  He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw."
22421,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
22422,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries.  It's not right for me to have it.
22423,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,He gave it to you.
22424,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,I'm not his son.
22425,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,I brought shame to my house.  I broke my father's heart.
22426,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_5,I forfeited the right to claim this sword.  It's yours.  May it serve you well and your children after you.
22427,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,Father used to watch us from up here.  He wouldn't say much.  You probably don't remember.  You were inside knitting all the time.
22428,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,I remember.
22429,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,"One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick.  I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground.  Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw.  There was one arrow in the target.  There was no one around, just like now.  No one to stop me.  So I started shooting.  And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.  I wasn't very good.  Finally I hit the bullseye.  It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th.  I don't remember.  But I hit the bullseye and I heard this."
22430,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me.  I knew what I was doing was against the rules.  But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong.  The rules were wrong.  I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.  Now he's dead.  Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
22431,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,What?
22432,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,"That's your pretty handwriting.  Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you.  ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart.  Our good King Robert is dead.  Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --"
22433,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,You don't have to read it.  I remember.
22434,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,"""Father has been charged with treason.  He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne.  The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort.  I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark.  Your faithful sister, Sansa."""
22435,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,They forced me to do it.
22436,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,Did they.  With a knife at your throat?  Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
22437,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,You don't know what it was like.  I was a child.
22438,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,So was I.  I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
22439,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,They told me it was the only way to save father.
22440,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,And you were stupid enough to believe them.  I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block.  I remember the pretty dress you were wearing.  I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
22441,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,You were there?
22442,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
22443,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,And what did you do?  Did you come running to the rescue?  Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
22444,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,I wanted to.
22445,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,But you didn't.  Just like me.
22446,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,I didn't betray him.  I didn't betray Robb.  I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
22447,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,"You should be on your knees thanking me.  We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.  You didn't win it back.  Jon didn't win it back.  He lost the Battle of the Bastards.  The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?"
22448,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,I was training.
22449,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,"Training.  Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine."
22450,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,"Oh, I don't know about that.  I can imagine quite a lot."
22451,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,You never would have survived what I survived.
22452,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,I guess we'll never know.
22453,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,What are you doing to do with that letter.
22454,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,I don't know yet.
22455,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,Who did you show it to?  Where did you find it?
22456,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,"You're scared, aren't you?  What are you scared of?  You didn't commit any crimes.  No one's going to hang you."
22457,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,Arya --
22458,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry?  No.  That's not Jon.  He'll understand.  You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
22459,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,"Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting?  This is exactly what she wants.  This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --"
22460,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,"The northern lords will read it.  They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.  What would little Lyanna Mormont say?  She's younger than you were when you wrote this.  Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
22461,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,You're angry.  Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
22462,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_8,Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.  I'll go with anger.
22463,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,You’re the one they call the dog.
22464,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Fuck off.
22465,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,They told me you were mean.  Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?
22466,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,I don't give two shits about Wildlings.
22467,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Gingers I hate.
22468,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Gingers are beautiful.  We are kissed by fire.  Just like you.
22469,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Don't point your fucking finger at me.
22470,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
22471,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,I didn't trip.  I was pushed.
22472,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Ever since you've been mean.
22473,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Will you fuck off?
22474,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,I don't think you're truly mean.  You have sad eyes.
22475,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Do you want to suck my dick?  Is that it?
22476,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Dick?
22477,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Cock.
22478,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Ah.  Dick.  I like it.
22479,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,I bet you do.
22480,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Nope.  It's pussy for me.  I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell.  If I ever get back there.  Yellow hair.  Blue eyes.  Tallest woman you've ever seen.  Almost as tall as you.
22481,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Brienne of Tarth.
22482,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,You know her?
22483,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
22484,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,"Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me."
22485,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,How does she look at you?  Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
22486,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,You do know her.
22487,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,We've met.
22488,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,I want to make babies with her.  Think of the great big monsters.  They'd conquer the world.
22489,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
22490,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,I'm good at killing people.
22491,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,You don't much look like him.
22492,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Who's that?
22493,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Your father.  I suppose you favor your mother.
22494,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,You knew him?
22495,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Of course I did.  When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain.  Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back.  Thoros has brought me back six times.  We both serve the same lord.
22496,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,I serve the north.
22497,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,The north didn't raise you from the dead.
22498,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,The lord of light never spoke to me.  I don't know anything about him.  I don't know what he wants from me.
22499,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,He wants you alive.
22500,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Why?
22501,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,I don't know.
22502,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,"That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know.  So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
22503,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,I think about that all the time.  I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing.  We're soldiers.  We have to know what we're fighting for.  I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
22504,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,So what are you fighting for?
22505,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Life.  Death is the enemy.  The first enemy and the last.
22506,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,But we all die.
22507,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,The enemy always wins.  And we still need to fight him.  That's all I know.  You and I wont find much joy while we're here.  But we can keep others alive.  We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
22508,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,"""I am the shield that guards the realms of men."""
22509,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that.  Maybe that's enough.
22510,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Aye.  Maybe that's enough.
22511,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,That's what I saw in the fire.
22512,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,A mountain like an arrowhead.
22513,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,Are you sure?
22514,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL,We're getting close.
22515,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,Do you know what I like about you?
22516,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,I honestly don't.
22517,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,You're not a hero.
22518,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,Oh.  I've been heroic on occasion.
22519,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
22520,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"I don't want you to be a hero.  Heroes do stupid things and they die.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."
22521,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"It's interesting these heroes you name.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
22522,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,Jon Snow's not in love with me.
22523,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"Oh, my mistake.  I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."
22524,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,He's too little for me. I didn't mean
22525,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,As heroes go he is quite little.
22526,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,I know you're brave. I wouldn't have chosen a coward as my Hand.
22527,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"So if all goes well, I'll finally get to meet your sister. From everything you've told me about her she'd rather murder me than speak with me."
22528,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"Oh first she'd torture you in some horrible way, then she'd murder you. Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me. But if we go to the capital, we'll go with two armies, we'll go with three dragons, and anyone touches you, King's Landing burns down to the foundation stone."
22529,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,And right now she's thinking of how to set a trap.
22530,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,Of course she is. And she's wondering what trap you're laying for her.
22531,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,Are we? Laying any traps?
22532,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"If we want to create a new and better world, I'm not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start."
22533,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?
22534,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"Yes, you'll need to be ruthless if you're going to win the throne. You need to inspire a degree of fear. But fear is all Cersei has. It's all my father had, and Joffrey. It makes their power brittle. Because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead."
22535,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.
22536,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"He did. But you once spoke to me of breaking the wheel. Aegon built the wheel. If that's the kind of queen you want to be, how are you different from all the other tyrants that came before you?"
22537,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,So we walk into the lion's den?
22538,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,My brother promised me he'd keep a grip on the Lannister forces.
22539,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"Forgive me, but I don't care about any Lannister promises. Except yours."
22540,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,And I promised him I'd keep you from doing anything impulsive.
22541,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,Impulsive?
22542,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,This will be a difficult negotiation. We're sitting down with people who want to see us both headless. My sister is likely to say something provocative.
22543,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,And?
22544,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,And you've been known to lose your temper from time to time. As all our great leaders do
22545,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,When have I lost my temper?
22546,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,Burning the Tarlys for instance.
22547,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,That was not impulsive. That was necessary.
22548,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,Perhaps.
22549,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,Perhaps.
22550,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,Perhaps the father needed to die and not the son. Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate the mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell. We had no time to discuss the possibilities before you ended their possibilities.
22551,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,One can be forgiven for thinking you're taking your family's side in this debate.
22552,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"I am taking their side. You need to take your enemy's side if you're going to see things the way they do. And you need to see things the way they do if you're going to anticipate their actions, respond effectively and beat them. Which I want you to do very much. Because I believe in you and the world you want to build. But the world you want to build doesn't get built all at once. Probably not in a single lifetime. How do we ensure your vision endures? After you break the wheel, how do we make sure it stays broken?"
22553,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"You want to know who sits on the Iron Throne after I'm dead, is that it?"
22554,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"You say you can't have children. But there are other ways of choosing a successor. The Night's Watch has one method, The Iron born folk, although many flaws"
22555,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.
22556,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows fly towards you when you fought on Blackwater Rush, and I saw hundred of arrows miss. But any one of them could have found your heart and end"
22557,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"You've been thinking about my death quite a bit, haven't you? Is this one of the items you've discussed with your brother in King's Landing?"
22558,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,I'm trying to serve you by planning for the long term.
22559,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_6,"Perhaps if you'd planned for the short term, we wouldn't have lost Dorne and Highgarden. We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown."
22560,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,Look!
22561,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,A  bear.
22562,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,Big fucker.
22563,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,Do bears have blue eyes?
22564,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,We have to get him back to Eastwatch.
22565,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,(Shakes his head.) Flask.
22566,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,Go on.
22567,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,You alright?
22568,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,I just got bit by a dead bear.
22569,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,Aye. You did.
22570,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,Funny old life. Alright then.
22571,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,Where did she get it?
22572,petyr baelish,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,I don't know. She seems very resourceful. You're worried.
22573,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,We're asking 20 000 men to fight with us in the worst winter any of them have ever seen. The weather will be the least of their problems. Many of them will be happy to find a good reason to go home.
22574,petyr baelish,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,You question their loyalty?
22575,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,Their loyalty is to JON SNOW. JON SNOW is not here. I haven't heard from him in weeks.
22576,petyr baelish,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,You're the Lady of Winterfell. The King chose you to rule in his absence. And rule you have. Wisely. Ably. They see that. They respect you. Some may even prefer you.
22577,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,"Yes, they turned their backs on JON SNOW when it was time to retake Winterfell and then they named him their king and now they're ready to turn their backs on him again. How far would you trust men like that? They're all bloody wind vanes. If they found out I wrote that letter a woman who's already married not one but two enemies of her House.  By the time JON SNOW comes back, he'll have no army left."
22578,petyr baelish,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,"Arya is not like them. She's your sister. You may have disagreements, but she would never betray her family."
22579,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,She would if she thought I was going to betray JON SNOW.
22580,petyr baelish,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,Is that what she thinks?
22581,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,I don't know what she thinks. I don't know her anymore.
22582,petyr baelish,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,Perhaps Lady Brienne can help. She's sworn to protect both of Catelyn Stark's girls. Did she not?
22583,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,She is.
22584,petyr baelish,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,"And if one of you were planning to harm the other in any way, wouldn't she be honor bound to intercede?"
22585,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR,She would.
22586,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,Something I've always wanted to know.
22587,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,Alright.
22588,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,How drunk were you when you charged through the breach on Pyke?
22589,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,"If I'm being honest, I don't remember charging through the breach. Some of the lads told me about it the next morning. Sounded like a good scrap."
22590,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,Aye. It was a proper scrap. The Ironborn thought you were some kind of god. The way you were waving that flaming sword. I thought you were the bravest man I ever saw.
22591,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,Just the drunkest.
22592,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,Where's the rest of them?
22593,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,If we wait long enough we will find out.
22594,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,(Nods)
22595,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,"Go back to Eastwatch. Get a raven to Daenerys, tell her what's happened."
22596,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,I'm not leaving you.
22597,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,You're the fastest. Go! Now!
22598,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,You're faster without the hammer. Give it! Give it!
22599,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,Come on! Run!
22600,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,Come on!
22601,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,Stop!
22602,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_6,Go!
22603,davos seaworth,7,66,beyond the wall,GENDRY running._1,What happened? Where are the others?
22604,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,GENDRY running._1,Raven. We need to send the raven.
22605,davos seaworth,7,66,beyond the wall,GENDRY running._1,Get the maester! Now!
22606,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,Thoros?
22607,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,Thoros!
22608,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,I say it's one of the better ways to go.
22609,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,"Lord of Light, show us the way. Come to us in our darkness and lead your servant into the light."
22610,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,We have to burn this body.
22611,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,And all the clothes behind him. Unless the Lord of Light is kind enough to send us a bit of fire.
22612,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,Come to us in our darkness. For the night is dark and full of terrors.
22613,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,"We'll all freeze soon. I saw the water. When you killed the white walker, almost all the dead that followed it fell. Why?"
22614,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,Maybe he was the one who turned them.
22615,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,We can go for the walkers. Maybe we'll stand a chance.
22616,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,No. We need to take that thing back with us. There's a raven flying for Dragonstone now. Daenerys is our only chance.
22617,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,No. There's another.
22618,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,Kill him. He turned them all.
22619,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,You don't understand
22620,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,"The Lord brought you back he brought me back No one else, just us. Did he do it to watch us freeze to death?"
22621,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,"Careful, Beric, you've lost your priest. This is your last life."
22622,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,I've been waiting for the end for a long time. Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it.
22623,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._1,Every Lord I've ever met it's been a cunt. Can't see why the Lord of Light should be any different.
22624,wolkan,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior,My lady.
22625,wolkan,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior,My lady?
22626,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior,It's an invitation. To King's Landing.
22627,brienne of tarth,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior,"My lady, you are the Lady of Winterfell."
22628,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior,"I am, and you will represent my interest at this gathering as you see them."
22629,brienne of tarth,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior,"They invited you, they want you there."
22630,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior,"I will not set foot in King's Landing while Cersei Lannister is queen. They want another Stark prisoner, they can come and take me. Until then, I'll remain where I belong. I have work to do here."
22631,brienne of tarth,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior,It's not safe.
22632,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior,Ser Jaime will be there. You said he treated you honourably before.
22633,brienne of tarth,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior,I'm not worried about me. It's not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.
22634,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior,I have many guards who'd happily imprison him or behead him whether or not you're here.
22635,brienne of tarth,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior,And you trust their loyalty? You trust he hasn't been speaking to them behind your back? Let me at least leave Podrick behind to watch over you. He has become a competent swordsman.
22636,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior,"I do not need to be watched over or minded or cared for. I'm not a child, I am the Lady of Winterfell and I am home. This is the safest place for me."
22637,brienne of tarth,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior,My lady. I sworn an oath to protect you and your sister. If I abandon you
22638,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior,"The trip to King's Landing is long, Lady Brienne, and you won't be travelling on summer roads. The sooner you leave, the better your chances of making it on time."
22639,brienne of tarth,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior,"Yes, Milady."
22640,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior,You can't! The most important person in the world can't fly to the most dangerous place in the world.
22641,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior,Who else can?
22642,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior,No one. They knew the risk when they left. You can't win the throne if you're dead. You can't break the wheel if you're dead.
22643,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior,So what would you have me do?
22644,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior,"Nothing. Sometimes nothing is the hardest thing to do. If you die we're all lost. Everyone, everything"
22645,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior,You told me to do nothing before and I've listened to you. I'm not doing nothing again.
22646,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake,Damn cunt.
22647,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake,"Oh, fuck."
22648,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake,Fuck it!
22649,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake,Fall back! Fall back!
22650,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake,Come on!
22651,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake,No!
22652,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake,JON SNOW!
22653,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake,Go! Go now! Leave!
22654,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1,Uncle Benjen! How?
22655,benjen stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1,You ride for the pass.
22656,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1,Come with me.
22657,benjen stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1,It's not time. Go!
22658,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,"The Wall,  Northern Coast",(Nods)
22659,tormund giantsbane,7,66,beyond the wall,"The Wall,  Northern Coast",(Nods)
22660,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,"The Wall,  Northern Coast","We'll meet again, Clegane."
22661,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,"The Wall,  Northern Coast",Fucking hope not.
22662,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,Top of the The Wall,"It's time to go, Your Grace."
22663,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,Top of the The Wall,A bit longer.
22666,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,Not what you're looking for?
22667,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,"(Gasps). I have hundreds of men here at Winterfell, all loyal to me."
22668,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,They're not here now.
22669,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,What are these?
22670,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,My faces.
22671,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,Where did you get them?
22672,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,"In Braavos, while I was training to be a faceless man."
22673,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,What does that mean?
22674,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,"Back in Braavos, before I got my first face, there was I game I used to play. The game of faces. It's simple"
22675,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,I don't want to play.
22676,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,How do you feel about JON SNOW being king? Is there someone else you feel should rule the North instead of him?
22677,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,"Those faces, what are they?"
22678,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,You want to do the asking? Are you sure? The game of faces didn't turn out so well for the last person who asked me questions.
22679,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,Tell me what they are!
22680,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,"We both wanted to be other people when we were younger. You wanted to be a queen. To sit next to a handsome young king on the Iron Throne. I wanted to be a knight, to pick up a sword like father and go off to battle. Neither of us got to be the other person, did we? The world doesn't just let girls decide what they are going to be. But I can now. With the faces I can choose. I can become someone else. Speak in their voice, live in their skin. I can even become you."
22681,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,I wonder what it would feel like to wear those pretty dresses. To be the Lady of Winterfell. All I'd need to find out is your face.
22682,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea",I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
22683,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea",I wish I could take it back. I wish we'd never gone.
22684,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea",I don't. If we hadn't gone I wouldn't have seen. You have to see it to know. Now I know. The dragons are my children. They're the only children I'll ever have. Do you understand?
22685,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea",(Nods.)
22686,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea",We are going to destroy the Night King and his army. And we'll do it together. You have my word.
22687,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea","Thank you, Dany."
22688,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea","Dany? Who was the last person who called me that? I'm not sure, was it my brother? Not the company you want to keep."
22689,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea","Alright. Not Dany. How about ""My Queen""? I'd bend the knee but..."
22690,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea",What about those who swore allegiance to you?
22691,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea",They'll all come to see you for what you are.
22692,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea",I hope I deserve it.
22693,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea",You do.
22694,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea",You should get some rest.
22695,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_1,Oil?
22697,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_1,How many barrels?
22699,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_1,Get 500 more.
22701,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_1,"I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord."""
22702,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_1,The thrill will fade.
22703,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_1,If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?
22704,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_1,Gold?
22705,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_1,I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
22706,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_1,Family.
22707,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_1,"Not without a cock, you don't."
22708,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_1,Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
22709,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_1,Yet your brother chooses to side with the cockless.
22710,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_1,"Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden."
22711,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_1,I think we're about to be the downtrodden.
22714,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship.,How many people live here?
22715,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship.,"A million, give or take."
22716,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship.,That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
22717,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship.,There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
22718,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing_1,Why isn't she with them?
22719,qyburn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing_1,"I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her."
22720,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing_1,And the rest of them?
22721,qyburn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing_1,They're on their way to the dragon pit now.
22722,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing_1,Including our brother.
22723,qyburn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing_1,"Yes, Your Grace."
22724,missandei,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_2,Why did they build it?
22725,jorah mormont,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_2,"Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem."
22726,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_2,"I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world."
22727,davos seaworth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_2,Maybe it still is.
22728,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_2,"Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did."
22729,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_2,I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.
22730,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_2,A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.
22731,podrick payne,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_2,"I never thought I'd see you again, my lord."
22732,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_2,"Supporting the enemy, no less."
22733,podrick payne,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_2,Hard to blame you.
22734,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_2,Cersei will anyway.
22735,podrick payne,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_2,I'm glad you're alive.
22736,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_2,Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.
22737,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside King's Landing_2,(Shakes his head.)
22739,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,Fuck off.
22740,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,I thought you were dead.
22741,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,Not yet. You came pretty close.
22742,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,I was only trying to protect her.
22743,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,You and me both.
22744,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,She's alive. Arya.
22745,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,Where?
22746,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,Winterfell.
22747,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,Who's protecting her if you're here?
22748,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.
22749,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,It won't be me.
22750,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.
22751,podrick payne,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,"It is, my lord."
22752,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,"I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
22753,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,I'm sure your new queen will be happy to restore yours if she ends up on the throne.
22754,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,"You've been thinking about our new queen? Perhaps you’ve been reconsidering your allegiances. Remember my offer – whatever they’re paying you, I’ll pay double.”"
22755,varys,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,"And that would be double what now, exactly?"
22756,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
22757,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,"Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
22758,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,"I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
22759,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,It's good to see you again.
22760,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road.,"Yeah, you, too."
22761,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside the Dragon PIt,"Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first."
22762,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?"
22763,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?
22764,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,You might.
22765,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.
22766,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
22767,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother. You know who’s coming for you. You’ve always known."
22768,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Where is she?
22769,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,She'll be here soon.
22770,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Didn't travel with you?
22771,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,No.
22772,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,We've been here for some time.
22773,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,My apologies.
22774,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,We are all facing a unique--
22775,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"Theon! I have your sister. If you don’t submit to me here, now… I’ll kill her."
22776,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
22777,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.
22778,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes?
22779,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,His wasn't even good.
22780,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
22781,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents."
22782,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Perhaps you ought to sit down.
22783,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Why?
22784,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Sit down or leave.
22785,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face."
22786,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?"
22787,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,We all know that will never happen.
22788,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Then why are we here?
22789,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
22790,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
22791,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
22792,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce."
22793,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Yes. That's all.
22794,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
22795,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
22796,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,The word of a would-be usurper.
22797,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
22798,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,We can destroy them by burning them.
22799,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world."
22800,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
22801,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.
22802,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,How many?
22803,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"A hundred thousand, at least."
22804,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Can they swim?
22805,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,No.
22806,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.
22807,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,What are you talking about?
22808,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me."
22809,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive."
22810,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."
22811,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,(SIGHS)
22812,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"In return, the King"
22813,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Just the King
22814,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"(CHUCKLES) I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son."
22815,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
22816,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.
22817,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Ser Jaime.
22818,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
22819,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.
22820,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother."
22821,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"Oh, fuck loyalty!"
22822,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Fuck loyalty?
22823,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.
22824,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,And tell her what?
22825,davos seaworth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I wish you hadn't done that.
22826,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing."
22827,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I know!
22828,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen  I would have advised it, had you asked. But have you ever considered learning how to lie every now and then? Just a bit?"
22829,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father if you want, tell me that’s the attitude that got him killed. But when enough people make false promises, words stop meaning anything. Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies, and lies won’t help us in this fight."
22830,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
22831,davos seaworth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
22832,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,"Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
22833,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I didn't come all this way to have my Hand murdered.
22834,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
22835,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,I did this. I should go.
22836,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister alone. Or we all go home and we’re right back where we started.
22837,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit,(Nods)
22838,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing portico,You spoke with her?
22839,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing portico,"At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
22840,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing portico,"I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?"
22841,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing portico,"I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another."
22842,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place."
22843,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you."
22844,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"So you bring her here with her pet Northerner,  whom you've convinced to bow down before her."
22845,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,I didn't know about that.
22846,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life."
22847,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"Cersei, I didn't know."
22848,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,the destruction of this family.
22849,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
22850,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,You killed our father
22851,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me."
22852,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one would've touched them if Father was here, no one would have dared-"
22853,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,I have never been more sorry about anything.
22854,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"I will not hear it, not from you."
22855,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,(starts)
22856,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,I will not hear it!
22857,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me."
22858,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"If it weren’t for me, you’d have a mother. If it weren’t for me, you’d have a father. If it weren’t for me, you’d have two beautiful children. I’ve thought about killing you more times than I can count. (turns to the MOUNTAIN) Do it! (turns back to Cersei) Say the word."
22859,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
22860,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,I will not
22861,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
22862,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.
22863,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?"
22864,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
22865,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something."
22866,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,What did you hope for?  To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.
22867,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"Mm, not like this."
22868,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her."
22869,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,Yes.
22870,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,Why?
22871,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,Because I think she will make the world a better place.
22872,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
22873,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
22874,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.
22875,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,"That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter."
22876,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber.,You're pregnant.
22877,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit,No one is less happy about this than I am.
22878,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit,"I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it."
22879,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit,"This place was the beginning of the end for my family. (Speaks Valerian.) A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else."
22880,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit,You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
22881,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit,I can't have children.
22882,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit,Who told you that?
22883,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit,The witch who murdered my husband.
22884,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit,Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
22885,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit,"You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
22886,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit,"So, what now?"
22887,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit,I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
22888,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit,It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
22889,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit,(Laughs)
22890,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit,"My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them."
22891,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
22892,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,"No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?"
22893,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
22894,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,"This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee."
22895,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
22896,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,What does that have to do with anything?
22897,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
22898,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,You think he wants to marry her?
22899,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,"An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King."
22900,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,"Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family."
22901,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,"You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?"
22902,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
22903,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,"Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men."
22904,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?
22905,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,She's your sister. You know her far better than I ever could.
22906,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.
22907,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,Why did she come to Winterfell?
22908,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
22909,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
22910,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.
22911,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,"And after she murders you, what does she become?"
22912,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_2,Lady of Winterfell.
22913,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room,"If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight."
22914,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room,"And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell."
22915,jorah mormont,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room,"Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror."
22916,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room,"It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message."
22917,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room,I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.
22918,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,Jon.
22919,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,Can I speak with you?
22920,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,All right.
22921,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,"What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You could've lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth."
22922,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.
22923,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,"You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step."
22924,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,"It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret."
22925,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,"Not compared to me, you haven't."
22926,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,No. Not compared to you.
22927,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.
22928,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,Our father was more of a father to you than yours ever was.
22929,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,He was.
22930,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.
22931,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,I did.
22932,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,(SIGHS) But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.
22933,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,But the things I've done.
22934,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,"It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark."
22935,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,"When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. (SNIFFLES) She needs me now."
22936,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room,"So, why are you still talking to me?"
22937,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,"Load up. Load up, lads. Go on. Tide's coming in."
22938,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,All of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind.
22939,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,Your sister’s dead.
22940,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,She's not dead.
22941,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,"She's dead. Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead."
22942,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,She's our queen
22943,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,She's your sister and you left her to die.
22944,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,I did. I ran from my uncle. I was a coward.
22945,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,"So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves."
22946,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,We're done with all that.
22947,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,Who says we are?
22948,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,"Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free."
22949,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,"Run away, little Theon. It's what you do best."
22954,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,Stay down or I'll kill you!
22955,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,(panting) I said stay down or I'll kill you!
22956,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing,Not for me. For Yara!
22958,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior,Have my sister
22959,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,Are you sure you want to do this?
22960,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.
22961,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,And what does honor demand?
22962,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.
22963,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"All right, then. Get on with it."
22964,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?
22965,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,My sister asked you a question.
22966,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused."
22967,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?"
22968,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,I did it to protect you.
22969,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon Arryn. You gave Lysa Tears of Lys to poison him. Do you deny it?"
22970,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"Whatever your aunt might have told you, she was a troubled woman. She imagined enemies everywhere."
22971,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn when, really, it was you. The conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters, it was you who started it. Do you deny it?"
22972,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,I know of no such letter.
22973,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father, Ned Stark. Thanks to your treachery, he was imprisoned and later executed on false charges of treason. Do you deny it?"
22974,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.
22975,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,You held a knife to his throat.
22976,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"You said, ""I did warn you not the trust me."""
22977,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"You told our mother this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister, but that was another one of your lies. It was yours."
22978,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you."
22979,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?
22980,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"If we could speak alone, I can explain everything."
22981,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother and Aunt Lysa and that’s what you tried to do to us."
22982,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"Sansa, please."
22983,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn."
22984,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.
22985,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,(Nods.)
22986,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,(to Yohn Royce) I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.
22987,yohn royce,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,I think not.
22988,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy."
22989,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"And yet, you betrayed her."
22990,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,I loved you. More than anyone.
22991,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"And yet, you betrayed me."
22992,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,"When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them."
22993,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell,Sansa! (GASPS) I--
22994,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.
22996,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell."
22997,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,Ser Jaime.
22998,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,Your Grace.
22999,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"My lords, I need a moment with my brother."
23001,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,What are you doing?
23002,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,Preparing the expedition north.
23003,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?"
23004,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.
23005,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father? ? You expect me to command our troops to fight beside foreign scum, to fight for the Dragon Queen?"
23006,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.
23007,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"And I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?"
23008,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!"
23009,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen defend the North. We stay here where we’ve always been.
23010,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,I made a promise.
23011,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,Our child will rule Westeros.
23012,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,Our child will never be born if the dead come south.
23013,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us."
23014,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,And then what?
23015,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,And then we rule.
23016,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!"
23017,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.
23018,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.
23019,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,How many dragons did you see at the pit?
23020,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,Two.
23021,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,What happened to the third?
23022,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!"
23023,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable."
23024,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!
23025,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You should've listened more when Father spoke about the importance of gold. Oh, I know it’s boring for you. You just wanted to hunt and ride and fight. But I listened, I learned. Highgarden bought us the most powerful army in Essos, the Golden Company. Twenty thousand men, horses, elephants, I believe."
23026,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
23027,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen? No one walks away from me. He’s sailing with his fleet to Essos, he’s going to ferry the Golden Company back here to help us win the war for Westeros."
23028,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander of your armies?"
23029,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen."
23030,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,I didn't conspire with him.
23031,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.
23032,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.
23033,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,And that will be treason.
23034,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,Treason?
23035,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"Disobeying your queen's command, fighting with her enemies, what would you call it?"
23036,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,Doesn't matter what I'd call it.
23037,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,I told you no one walks away from me.
23038,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father is gone. It’s just me and you now."
23039,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,There's one more yet to come.
23040,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,"Give the order, then."
23041,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.,I  don't believe you.
23042,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,Come in.
23043,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,Samwell Tarly.
23044,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.
23045,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,I remember everything.
23046,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,You helped us get beyond the Wall. You're a good man.
23047,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,"Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?"
23048,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,I became the Three-Eyed Raven.
23049,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,Oh! I don't know what that means.
23050,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,I can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell?
23051,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,"Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him."
23052,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,He's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen.
23053,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,"You, you saw this  in a vision?"
23054,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,Oh.
23055,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,He needs to know the truth.
23056,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,The truth about what?
23057,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,"About himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt, Lyanna Stark. He was born in a tower in Dorne. His last name isn’t really Snow. It’s Sand."
23058,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,It's not.
23059,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,Dornish bastards are named Sand.
23060,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,"At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony."
23061,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,Are you certain?
23062,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior,It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?
23063,rhaegar targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days."
23064,lyanna stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days."
23065,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback,"Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie. Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt, or rape her."
23066,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Boat interior,He loved her. And she loved him.
23067,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback_1,And Jon -  Jon's real name.
23068,lyanna stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback_1,"His name is Aegon Targaryen. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned."
23069,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Boat Interior,He's never been a bastard-- he’s the heir to the Iron Throne.
23070,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Boat Interior,He needs to know. We need to tell him.
23071,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,Are you all right?
23072,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,"It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me."
23073,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,You did the right thing.
23074,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,You did it.
23075,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady of Winterfell.
23076,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,Does that bother you?
23077,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.
23078,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,You would have. You're the strongest person I know.
23079,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
23080,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,"Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying."
23081,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,"""In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another."""
23082,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,"Father. ‘When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives."
23083,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,I miss him.
23084,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,"Me, too."
23085,beric dondarrion,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Wall.,It's a long way down.
23086,tormund,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Wall.,Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.
23089,tormund,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Wall.,Come on!  Run! Run!
23090,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE,You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won’t freeze off.
23091,varys,8,68,winterfell,HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE,"You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?"
23092,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE,"Because I have balls, and you don't."
23093,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE,I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
23094,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE,Look at you.
23095,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE,You're a man.
23096,bran stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE,Almost.
23097,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE,Where's Arya?
23098,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE,Lurking somewhere.
23099,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE,"Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell."
23100,daenerys targaryen,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE,"Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you."
23101,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE,"Winterfell is yours, Your Grace."
23102,bran stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE,We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.
23103,bran stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE,"He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south."
23104,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,"As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?"
23105,smalljon umber,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,"We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady."
23106,smalljon umber,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,And my lord.
23107,smalljon umber,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,And my queen. Sorry.
23108,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.
23109,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.
23110,wolkan,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,"At once, Your Grace."
23111,lyanna mormont,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,"""Your Grace."""
23112,lyanna stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,But you’re not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I’m not sure what you are now.
23113,lyanna stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,A lord? Nothing at all?
23114,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,It's not important.
23115,lyanna stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,Not important? We named you King in the North.
23117,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,"You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I’ll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North."
23118,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,"If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause."
23119,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,"I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die."
23120,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,"May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?"
23121,daenerys targaryen,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL,Whatever they want.
23122,gendry,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,"Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it."
23124,gendry,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,Are these the last of the wagons?
23126,gendry,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,"All right, let's get it all to the forges."
23127,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,My lord. My lady.
23128,yohn royce,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,My lady.
23129,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.
23130,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,"So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose."
23131,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.
23132,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,It had its moments.
23133,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,Apologies for leaving like that.
23134,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,"Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder."
23135,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,We both survived.
23136,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.
23137,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,"I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-"
23138,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?
23139,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,She did.
23140,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,And you believed her?
23141,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
23142,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
23143,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,You used to be taller.
23144,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,How did you sneak up on me?
23145,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,How did you survive a knife through the heart?
23146,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,I didn't.
23147,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,You still have it.
23148,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,Needle.
23149,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,Have you ever used it?
23150,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,Once or twice.
23151,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,Valyrian steel.
23152,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,Jealous?
23153,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,Too heavy for me.
23154,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,Where were you before? I could've used your help with Sansa.
23155,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,"She doesn't like your queen, does she?"
23156,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
23157,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,She's the smartest person I've ever met.
23158,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,Now you're defending her?
23159,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,You?
23160,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,I'm defending our family. So is she.
23161,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,Yeah. I'm her family too.
23162,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,Don't forget that.EXT – KING'S LANDING - DAYPan down from a view of the Red Keep to see QYBURN walking up to CERSEI LANNISTER who stares out at the sea.
23163,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,"Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall."
23164,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD,Good.
23165,yara greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN,Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?
23166,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN,But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.
23167,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN,If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?
23168,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN,I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.
23169,yara greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN,Are we in King's Landing?
23170,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN,Mm.
23171,yara greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN,You picked the losing side.
23172,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN,Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.
23173,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN,But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.
23174,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,"Twenty-thousand men, is it?"
23175,harry strickland,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,"Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit."
23176,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.
23177,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,Horses?
23178,harry strickland,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,Two thousand.
23179,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,And elephants?
23180,harry strickland,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,"Uh, no elephants, Your Grace."
23181,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.
23182,harry strickland,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,"They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages."
23183,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,"In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland."
23184,harry strickland,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,"We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace."
23185,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,Am I most welcome here?
23186,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.
23187,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,Good. As a true friend and an honored guest
23188,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,I was hoping we could talk in private.
23189,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,After the war. That was our agreement.
23190,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,Wars sometimes last years.
23191,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,"You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her."
23192,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,How?
23193,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,"I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken."
23194,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,You're insolent. I've executed men for less.
23195,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL,They were lesser men.
23196,dirah (prostitue),8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.
23197,craya,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,Burnt up some of my favorite boys.
23198,dirah (prostitue),8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,"Archie, was it?"
23199,craya,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,And William.
23200,dirah (prostitue),8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,Tall handsome William?
23201,craya,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,"Yeah, tall handsome William."
23202,dirah (prostitue),8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.
23203,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.
23204,craya,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,Did you?
23205,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,Nearly killed it.
23206,marei,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,That's brave.
23207,craya,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,That boy Eddie.
23208,dirah (prostitue),8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,The ginger?
23209,craya,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.
23210,dirah (prostitue),8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,How does he sleep with no eyelids?
23211,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,"All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"
23212,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
23213,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,You're kidding me.
23214,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,"Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry."
23215,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,"Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps."
23216,craya,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.
23217,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.
23218,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,Which girl?
23219,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
23220,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,"She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them."
23221,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,"That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside."
23222,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,"So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-"
23223,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.
23224,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,"Yeah, well, good luck with that."
23225,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-
23226,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,She has a keen sense of poetic justice.
23227,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,That fucking family.
23228,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL,"When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?"
23229,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS,I wanted those elephants.
23230,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS,"So, how do I compare to the fat king?"
23231,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS,You're insulting my late husband?
23232,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS,Are you offended?
23233,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS,"Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body."
23234,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS,And the Kingslayer?
23235,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS,"You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?"
23236,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS,Life is boring.
23237,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS,"You're not boring, I'll give you that."
23238,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS,Do I please the queen?
23239,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS,You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.
23240,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS,But now I want to be alone.
23241,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS,I'm going to put a prince in your belly.
23242,yara greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS,"Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships."
23243,yara greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS,We can take our home back.
23244,theon greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS,Daenerys went north.
23245,yara greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS,Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.
23246,theon greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS,You're my queen. I go where you command.
23247,yara greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS,You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.
23248,theon greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,THEON'S SHIPS,What is dead may never die.
23249,wolkan,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,"Welcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me"
23250,varys,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,The Karstarks.
23251,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,"One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway."
23252,davos seaworth,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,Can't argue with that.
23253,davos seaworth,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,"Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses."
23254,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,And our queen is grateful.
23255,davos seaworth,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,"Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it."
23256,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,I sense that you're leading to a proposal.
23257,davos seaworth,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,"A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?"
23258,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,They do make a handsome couple.
23259,varys,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.
23260,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,I'm not that old.
23261,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,Not as old as him.
23262,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
23263,varys,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,"Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth."
23264,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,What is that?
23265,varys,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,Nothing lasts.
23266,daenerys targaryen,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL,Your sister doesn't like me.
23267,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL,"She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up."
23268,daenerys targaryen,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL,She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-
23269,daenerys targaryen,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL,How many today?
23271,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL,What's the matter?
23272,daenerys targaryen,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL,The dragons are barely eating.
23273,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,FLAT CLEARINGJON and DAENERYS walk up to DROGON and RHAEGAL who are standing either side of a pile of bones. The dragons growl softly as they approach.,What's wrong with them?
23274,daenerys targaryen,8,68,winterfell,FLAT CLEARINGJON and DAENERYS walk up to DROGON and RHAEGAL who are standing either side of a pile of bones. The dragons growl softly as they approach.,They don't like the North.
23275,daenerys targaryen,8,68,winterfell,FLAT CLEARINGJON and DAENERYS walk up to DROGON and RHAEGAL who are standing either side of a pile of bones. The dragons growl softly as they approach.,Go on.
23276,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,FLAT CLEARINGJON and DAENERYS walk up to DROGON and RHAEGAL who are standing either side of a pile of bones. The dragons growl softly as they approach.,I don't know how to ride a dragon.

23427,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAYCUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL,"Thank you, Your Grace."
23428,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY,"Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool."
23429,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY,I was a fool.
23430,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY,Not for the first time.
23431,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY,"Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can."
23432,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY,I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.
23433,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,Don't you have something better to do?
23434,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,You make my weapon yet?
23435,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.
23436,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.
23437,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,It's strong enough.
23438,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,"It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know."
23439,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,Are you going to be down in the crypt?
23440,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,"No, but-"
23441,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,But you're a fighter.
23442,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,I've done my share.
23443,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,You've fought them?
23444,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,I did. Some of them.
23445,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,How many?
23446,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,A few. That was enough.
23447,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,What are they like?
23448,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,Bad. Really bad.
23449,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,"""Really bad""?"
23450,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,"Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?"
23451,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,"Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-this is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like."
23452,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,I know Death.
23453,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,He's got many faces.
23454,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,I look forward to seeing this one.
23455,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,My weapon?
23456,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES,I'll get right on it.
23457,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,I'm sorry for what I did to you.
23458,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.
23459,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,I'm not that person anymore.
23460,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,"You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark."
23461,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,You're not?
23462,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,No. I'm something else now.
23463,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,You're not angry at me.
23464,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,I'm not angry at anyone.
23465,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,Why didn't you tell them?
23466,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.
23467,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,What about afterwards?
23468,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,How do you know there is an afterwards?
23469,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,"Well, here we are."
23470,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,"Yes, here we are."
23471,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,Together again.
23472,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,And the masses rejoice.
23473,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,How do they feel about their new queen?
23474,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,She's your new queen too.
23475,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.
23476,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,And she is? Different?
23477,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,She is.
23478,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,You're sure about her?
23479,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,I am.
23480,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,She didn't seem sure about you.
23481,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
23482,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,Hmm.
23483,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
23484,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,Was she lying about the baby too?
23485,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,"No, that part is real."
23486,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.
23487,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,What?
23488,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,"She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."
23489,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,"So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I would've chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-"
23491,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,Your cock.
23492,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,My cock.
23493,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
23494,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_11,Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.
23495,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,Ser Jaime.
23496,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,Lady Brienne.
23497,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,He's come a long way.
23498,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,He's alright. Still has a lot to learn.
23499,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.
23500,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,"I am. It's, uh-it's good ground."
23501,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,It is.
23502,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,"The rise, it should give us some advantage."
23503,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,"If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back."
23504,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,"Yes, I think you're right."
23505,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,What are you doing?
23506,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,What?
23507,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,I think you know.
23508,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,I truly don't.
23509,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.
23510,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,You want me to insult you?
23511,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,No!
23512,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,Good.
23513,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,"I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me."
23514,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE,I better get back.
23515,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS,"Forgive me, khaleesi."
23516,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS,Have you done something to offend me?
23517,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS,Many things.
23518,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS,Long ago and long forgiven.
23519,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS,"But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart."
23520,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS,"When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again."
23521,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS,You made the right choice.
23522,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS,I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
23523,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS,I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
23524,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS,But the mind behind all those words-
23525,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS,He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.
23526,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS,As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.
23527,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS,You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?
23528,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS,"I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me."
23529,yohn royce,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,"The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates."
23530,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.
23531,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,"Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone."
23532,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.
23533,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,"Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone."
23534,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
23535,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.
23536,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
23537,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,"I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei."
23538,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,You never should have either.
23539,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,I thought he knew his sister.
23540,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,Families are complicated.
23541,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,Ours certainly have been.
23542,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,A sad thing to have in common.
23543,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,"We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell."
23544,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,"And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother."
23545,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,"He loves you, you know that."
23546,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,That bothers you.
23547,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.
23548,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,"All my life, I've known one goal"
23549,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.
23550,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,"I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about."
23551,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,Who was the first?
23552,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,Someone taller.
23553,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,"And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?"
23554,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,I take the Iron Throne.
23555,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,"What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?"
23556,wolkan,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,"Apologies, my lady. Your Grace."
23557,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_1,What is it?
23558,theon greyjoy,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL,My queen.
23559,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL,Your sister?
23560,theon greyjoy,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL,"She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name."
23561,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL,But why aren't you with her?
23562,theon greyjoy,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL,"I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me."
23564,davos seaworth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,"You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way."
23566,gilly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,"When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts."
23567,gilly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,They're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.
23569,teela,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,Which way should I go?
23570,davos seaworth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,Which way do you want to go?
23571,teela,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,All the children will be going below when the time comes.
23572,teela,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,But both me brothers were soldiers. I want to fight too.
23573,gilly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,"That's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us."
23574,davos seaworth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,I'm sure a lot of people would.
23575,teela,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,"All right. I'll defend the crypt, then."
23576,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,My little crow.
23577,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,I thought we'd lost you.
23578,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,Almost.
23579,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,How did you find each other?
23580,eddison tollett,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,We met up at the Last Hearth.
23581,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,The dead got there first.
23582,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,The Umbers?
23583,beric dondarrion,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,Fighting for the Night King now.
23584,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,We had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.
23585,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,How long do we have?
23586,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD,Before the sun comes up tomorrow.
23587,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAYCUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALLS,They're coming.
23588,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_12,We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.
23589,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,But there are too many of them.
23590,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – BATTLEMENTS,Far too many.
23591,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_2,Our enemy doesn't tire.
23592,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_2,Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.
23593,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,We can't beat them in a straight fight.
23594,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,"So, what can we do?"
23595,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.
23596,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,"If that's true, he'll never expose himself."
23597,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,"Yes, he will."
23598,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,"He'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens."
23599,samwell tarly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,Why? What does he want?
23600,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,"An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory."
23601,samwell tarly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,"That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you."
23602,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,How will he find you?
23603,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,His mark is on me.

23605,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,"We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest."
23606,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,No. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait for him in the Godswood.
23607,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,You want us to use you as bait?
23608,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,We're not leaving you alone out there.
23609,theon greyjoy,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,He won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. (to Bran) I took this castle from you. Let me defend you now.

23611,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,"When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench."
23612,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.
23613,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,"Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives."
23614,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,"There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it."
23615,davos seaworth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,The dragons should give us an edge in the field.
23616,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,"If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does."
23617,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,Dragonfire will stop him?
23618,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,I don't know. No one's ever tried.
23619,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_2,We're all going to die.

23631,grey worm,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"When Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here. I am loyal to my queen. I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is over and she has won, do you want to grow old in this place? Is there nothing else you want to do, nothing else you want to see?"
23632,missandei,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,Naath. I'd like to see the beaches again.
23633,grey worm,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,Then I will take you there.
23634,missandei,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,My people are peaceful. We cannot protect ourselves.
23635,samwell tarly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,Have you told her yet?
23636,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,No.
23637,samwell tarly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,Mm-hmm. Being careful. Biding your time. Waiting for the perfect-

23639,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,Gilly? Little Sam?
23640,samwell tarly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,They'll be safe down in the crypt.
23641,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,If you want to join them.
23642,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,To protect them.
23643,samwell tarly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed Thenns.
23644,eddison tollett,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,Thenn.
23645,samwell tarly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,"I've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there."
23646,eddison tollett,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,"Well, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked."
23647,samwell tarly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,"Well, calling you ""fucked"" wouldn't be strictly accurate."
23648,eddison tollett,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,Samwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more signs the world was ending.
23649,samwell tarly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,"Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp."
23650,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,Now it's just us three.
23651,eddison tollett,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - NIGHTCUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,"Last man left, burn the rest of us."
23652,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,I wish Father were here.
23653,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.
23654,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,That would be something to see.
23655,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall."
23656,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,Mm.
23657,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.
23658,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.
23659,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,I was speaking in relative terms.
23660,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,Do you miss it?
23661,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,Of course I miss it.
23662,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"Well, my golden lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you."
23663,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,It's not. Things would be easier if it were.
23664,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,The perils of self-betterment.
23665,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,Oh! My lady.
23666,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-"
23667,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.
23668,podrick payne,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"Thank you, milord."
23669,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,I don't think that's wise.
23670,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,The battle might start at any moment.
23671,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,Half cup.
23672,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,And you?
23673,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"No, thank you. I should try and get some sleep."
23674,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.
23675,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,All right. Just a bit.
23676,davos seaworth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"Well, what do we have here?"
23677,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"Ser Davos, join us."
23678,davos seaworth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this."
23679,davos seaworth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.
23680,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"It could be our last night in this world, you know."
23681,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"Yes, well, I'm glad you're here."
23682,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.
23683,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,Would you like a drink?
23684,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,Brought my own.
23685,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"They call you ""King Killer."""
23686,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,I'm sure someone does.
23687,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"They call me ""Giantsbane."" Want to know why?"
23688,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,I killed a giant when I was ten. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.
23689,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk."
23690,davos seaworth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,Maybe I will have that drink.
23691,sandor clegane,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,You never used to shut up. Now you're just sitting there like a mute.
23692,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,Guess I've changed.
23693,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,What are you doing up here?
23694,sandor clegane,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,What's it look like?
23695,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,"No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?"
23696,sandor clegane,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,"I fought for you, didn't I?"
23697,sandor clegane,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,"Oh, for fuck's sake. May as well be at a bloody wedding."
23698,beric dondarrion,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,My lady. It's good to see you again. I'm sorry we parted the way we did.
23699,sandor clegane,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,Was he on your list?
23700,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,For a little while.
23701,beric dondarrion,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,That's all right.
23702,beric dondarrion,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same. This is his moment. When light-
23703,sandor clegane,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,"Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon. Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back nineteen times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall."
23704,sandor clegane,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,Where are you going?
23705,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS,I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.
23706,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,That for me?
23707,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,This'll work.
23708,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,"Last time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell. Took the long road, but…"
23709,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,What did the Red Woman want with you?
23710,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.
23711,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,Why your blood?
23712,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.
23713,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,"I didn't know until she told me. Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me."
23714,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,Was that your first time?
23715,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,"No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock."
23716,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,Your first time with a woman.
23717,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,What? I-I didn't-I wasn't with her.
23718,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?
23719,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,Or after?
23720,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,You don't remember?
23721,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,"Yes, I was."
23722,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,One? Two? Twenty?
23723,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,"Well, I didn't keep count."
23724,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,"Yes, you did."
23725,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,Three.
23726,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.
23727,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,"Arya, I-"
23728,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_2,I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.
23729,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,"It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together."
23730,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,At least we'll die with honor.
23731,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,I think we might live.
23732,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.
23733,davos seaworth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,All without a shred of combat ability.
23734,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,"Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke."
23735,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.
23736,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,"Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne."
23737,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,She's not a ser? You're not a knight?
23738,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,Women can't be knights.
23739,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,Why not?
23740,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,Tradition.
23741,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,Fuck tradition.
23742,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,I don't even want to be a knight.
23743,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,"I'm no king. But if I were, I'd knight you ten times over."
23744,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.
23745,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,I'll prove it.
23746,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,"Kneel, Lady Brienne."
23747,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.
23748,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,"In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave."
23749,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,"In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just."

23751,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,"Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms."
23752,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_2,Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!
23753,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1,We have all we need to win this war.

23755,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1,"Please, listen to me. You're the future of our house."
23756,lyanna stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1,I don't need you to remind me of that.
23757,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS_1,You'll be safer in the crypt. These things we're fighting-
23758,lyanna stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_14,"I will not hide underground. I pledged to fight for the North, and I will fight."
23759,samwell tarly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_14,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-"
23760,lyanna stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_14,It's all right. We're done here.
23761,lyanna stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_14,"I wish you good fortune, cousin."
23762,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_14,"Thank you, my lady."
23763,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_14,What have you got there?
23764,samwell tarly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_14,It's called Heartsbane. It's my family sword.
23765,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_14,You still have a family.
23766,samwell tarly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_14,"Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it. But I can't really hold it upright. Your father, he taught me how to be a man. How to do what's right. This is right. It's Valyrian steel. I'd be honored if you'd take it."
23767,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_14,I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.
23768,samwell tarly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_14,I'll see you when it's through.

24226,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,To climbing mountains.
24227,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,What's she like down there?
24228,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,What? That's not your concern.
24229,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,I haven't been with a woman for years. Give me a morsel.
24230,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,You're a dog.
24231,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,"I am the Imp, and I demand to know."
24232,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,I knew you were fucking her. A pair of tall blond toffs. Must be like looking in the mirror.
24233,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,"Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. Where's your drink? What are you, what are you doing up North?"
24234,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,What are you doing with that?
24235,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,"Oh, this? This is for you. For both of you."
24236,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,You're supposed to be south.
24237,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts. Do you know that?
24238,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,That's a bit rude.
24239,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,"Year after year, I've shoveled Lannister shit, and what do I have to show?"
24240,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,"You're a knight, thanks to me."
24241,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,Thanks to me. And that title's worth as much as a blonde hair from your brother's ballsack.
24242,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,Power resides where men believe-
24243,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,Shut your mouth.
24244,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,I'm just trying-
24245,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,"I've never hit a dwarf before, but say another word and I will belt you."
24246,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,"See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all-"
24247,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,"You couldn't do it on your best day, you one-handed fuck. And your best days are long gone."
24248,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,You broke my nose!
24249,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,I did not break your nose.
24250,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,How do you know?
24251,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,"Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size, and I know what it sounds like. Now listen. Your sister offered me Riverrun. Nice big castle, good lands, plenty of peasants who do what they're told."
24252,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,And you trust Cersei-
24253,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,"I knew your sister was dead the second I saw those dragons. Now, your army may be torn to shit, but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win. And it just so happens I'm a betting man. If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up."
24254,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,"Mmm, that's good. Of course, the odds change if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead. Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one. All of a sudden-"
24255,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,May I speak?
24256,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,Why not? Only death will shut you up.
24257,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,We made a deal long ago. Do you remember?
24258,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,"If anyone offered me money to kill you, you'd pay me double. What's double Riverrun?"
24259,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,Highgarden. You could be Lord of the Reach.
24260,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,Highgarden? Are you mad?
24261,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,It's better than being dead.
24262,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,He's not going to kill us. He wouldn't be talking to us if-
24263,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,"The way I see it, I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive."
24264,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.
24265,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,"No? Who were your ancestors, the ones who made your family rich? Fancy lads in silk? They were fucking cutthroats. That's how all the great houses started, isn't it? With a hard bastard who was good at killing people. Kill a few hundred people, they make you a lord. Kill a few thousand, they make you king. And then all your cocksucking grandsons can ruin the family with their cocksucking ways."
24266,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,Highgarden. Give me your word.
24267,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE,You have my word. None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing. We ride south in the morning. We could use an officer with knowledge of the city's defenses.
24268,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY",For fuck's sake.
24270,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY",Not anymore. I don't like crowds.
24271,arya stark,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY",Me neither.
24272,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY",Why not? They all love you now. You're the big hero.
24273,arya stark,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY",Don't like heroes.
24274,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY",It must have felt good sticking a knife in that horned fucker.
24275,arya stark,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY",Felt better than dying. You're heading to King's Landing?
24276,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY",I have some unfinished business.
24277,arya stark,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY",Me too.
24278,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY",I don't plan on coming back.
24279,arya stark,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY",Neither do I.
24280,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY",Gonna leave me to die again if I get hurt?
24281,arya stark,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY",Probably.
24282,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,My lady.
24283,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,"""My lord"" is the standard response."
24284,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,Why her?
24285,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,You know she loves your brother.
24286,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.
24287,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,"You seem determined to dislike her. A good relationship between the Iron Throne and the North has been the core of every peaceful, prosperous reign we've ever known."
24288,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,"Jon will be Warden of the North, so a good relationship seems likely."
24289,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.
24290,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,"Well, I suppose that's up to him."
24291,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,"Sansa, look at me."
24292,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,"With Jon in the capital, you'll be the true power in the North. I'd feel much better about the future if I left here today believing that you and Daenerys were allies."
24293,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,What are you worried about? Jon's taking our army with him. Your queen still has her dragons--
24294,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,She's your queen too.
24295,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,"You don't have to be her friend. But why provoke her? How is that in the best interest of your family, or the North, or-"
24296,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,You're afraid of her.
24297,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.
24298,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,I don't want Jon to go down there. The men in my family don't do well in the capital.
24299,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,"No, but as your brother once told me, he's not a Stark."
24300,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,Are you all right?
24301,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,"Her people love her, you've seen that. You've seen how they fight for her. She wants to make the world a better place. I believe in her."
24302,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,Tyrion.
24303,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY,What if there's someone else? Someone better?
24304,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,You're not gonna ride the dragon south?
24305,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,Just a horse. Rhaegal needs to heal. He doesn't need me weighing him down.
24306,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,(scoffs). You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.
24307,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,(laughs)
24308,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,I'm taking the Free Folk home. We've had enough of the south. The women down here don't like me.
24309,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,"This is the North, you know. And the Free Folk are welcome to stay."
24310,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,It isn't home. We need room to wander. I'll take them back through Castle Black as soon as the winter storms pass. Back where we belong.
24311,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,It's where he belongs too. A direwolf has no place in the south. Will you take him with you? He'll be happier up there.
24312,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,So would you.
24313,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,"I wish I was going with you. This is farewell, then."
24314,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,You never know.
24315,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,You've got the North in you. The real North.
24316,sam,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,"Yes, well, the nights have been getting longer and there wasn't that much to do in Oldtown. There's only so many books a person can read, so we-"
24317,gilly,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,"I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam. If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon."
24318,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,I hope it's a girl.
24319,sam,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,You're the best friend I ever had.
24320,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_6,"You too, Sam."
24321,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,"Think of the past twenty years. The war, the murder, the misery. All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone who didn't love him back."
24322,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,How many others know?
24323,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,Including us? Eight.
24324,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,"Well, then it's not a secret anymore. It's information. If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon. Then what happens?"
24325,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,"She loses the North. She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that."
24326,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,"No, it's worse than that. He has the better claim to the throne."
24327,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,He doesn't want the throne.
24328,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,"I'm not sure it matters what he wants. The fact is, people are drawn to him. Wildlings, Northmen. He's a war hero."
24329,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,"He loves our queen. And she loves him. If we marry them, they could rule together."
24330,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,(with distaste) She's his aunt.
24331,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,That never stopped a Targaryen before.
24332,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,"No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell. Is marrying your aunt common in the North? You know our queen better than I do. Do you think she wants to share the throne? She does not like to have her authority questioned."
24333,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,Something she has in common with every monarch who ever lived.
24334,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,I worry about her state of mind.
24335,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS,We are advisors to the queen. Worrying about her state of mind is our job. We still have to take King's Landing. Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all. That would solve our problems.
24336,grey worm,8,71,the last of the starks,THE TARGARYEN FLEET_2,Get to the skiff.
24337,grey worm,8,71,the last of the starks,THE TARGARYEN FLEET_2,Now!
24343,missandei,8,71,the last of the starks,THE TARGARYEN FLEET_3,No!
24346,grey worm,8,71,the last of the starks,THE SHORE OF BLACKWATER BAY,Missandei? Missandei!
24347,grey worm,8,71,the last of the starks,THE SHORE OF BLACKWATER BAY,Missandei!
24348,cersei lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY","Our message was well-received, then?"
24349,qyburn,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY",Your people have heard the Usurper is coming. They are grateful for your protection within the walls of the Red Keep.
24350,cersei lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY",You're certain about the dragon?
24351,euron greyjoy,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY",I saw it sink beneath the waves.
24352,cersei lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY",That must have been glorious.
24353,euron greyjoy,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY","The glory is yours, my queen."
24354,cersei lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY","When the war is won, the Lion shall rule the land, the Kraken shall rule the sea, and our child shall one day rule them all."
24355,euron greyjoy,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY",She's coming for you.
24356,cersei lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY","Of course she is. Keep the gates open. If she wants to take the castle, she'll have to murder thousands of innocent people first."
24357,cersei lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,"KING'S LANDING, THE RED KEEP, DAY","So much for ""the Breaker of Chains."""
24358,grey worm,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1,"We will storm the city, my queen. We will kill your enemies. All of them."
24359,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1,Your Grace. I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly if I ever thought you were making a mistake. This is a mistake.
24360,daenerys targaryen,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1,You saw my child fall from the sky.
24361,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1,(nods)
24362,daenerys targaryen,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1,They took Missandei.
24363,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1,"Cersei needs to be destroyed, but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied and the Dothraki, tens of thousands of innocents will die. That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep. These are the people you came here to protect. I beg you, Your Grace. Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat."
24364,daenerys targaryen,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1,"Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys? I'm here to free the world from tyrants. That is my destiny and I will serve it, no matter the cost."
24365,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1,"It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies make it to King's Landing. In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender. Offer her her life in exchange for the throne. If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter, we should make the effort."
24366,daenerys targaryen,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1,"Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter. But perhaps it's good the people see that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed, and Cersei Lannister refused. They should know whom to blame when the sky falls down upon them."
24367,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,I've served tyrants most of my life. They all talk about destiny.
24368,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones and walked out with three dragons. How could she not believe in destiny?
24369,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,Perhaps that's the problem. Her life has convinced her that she was sent here to save us all.
24370,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,And how do you know she wasn't?
24371,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,"Then there's the problem of Jon Snow. Perhaps it's actually a solution. You know them both. Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler?"
24372,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,He doesn't want the throne. That's why he bent the knee.
24373,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,Have you considered the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule?
24374,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,We're discussing treason.
24375,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.
24376,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,Of course I've thought about it. Thoughts aren't treason.
24377,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,"He's temperate and measured. He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros, whose support we are going to need."
24378,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,"Joffrey was a man. I don't think a cock is a true qualification, as I'm sure you'd agree."
24379,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,"And he's the heir to the throne. Yes, because he's a man. Cocks are important, I'm afraid."
24380,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,What about my earlier proposal? They could rule together as king and queen.
24381,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,"She's too strong for him. She'd bend him to her will, as she already has."
24382,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,He could temper her worst impulses.
24383,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,As you have? You're drinking quite a lot. A Targaryen father and a Stark mother. Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.
24384,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,How many kings and queens have you served? Five? Six? I've lost count.
24385,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,You've always known my reasons.
24386,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,"At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person."
24387,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,Even if you know it's a mistake?
24388,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,I believe in our queen. She'll make the right choice. With the help of her loyal advisers.
24389,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,You know where my loyalty stands. You know I will never betray the realm.
24390,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,"What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne."
24391,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,"Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne. We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I. They deserve to live. They deserve food for their children. I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost."
24392,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,"So, what happens to her?"
24393,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,Please. Don't.
24394,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM,I've spoken as honestly as I can. Each of us has a choice to make. I pray we choose wisely.

24407,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE COURTYARD_1,I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister. Seems like I won't get the chance.
24408,brienne of tarth,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT",They're going to destroy that city. You know they will.
24409,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT",Have you ever run away from a fight?
24410,brienne of tarth,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT",You're not like your sister. You're not. You're better than she is. You're a good man and you can't save her. You don't need to die with her. Stay here. Stay with me. (voice breaking) Please. Stay.
24411,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT","You think I'm a good man? I pushed a boy out a tower window, crippled him for life for Cersei. I strangled my cousin with my own hands just to get back to Cersei. I would have murdered every man, woman and child in Riverrun for Cersei."

24425,qyburn,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY",Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. You are her subject.

I know this. I know this because I've seen it. You've always loved your children. More than yourself, more than Jaime more than anything. I beg you. If not for yourself, then for your child. Your reign is over, but that doesn't mean your life has to end. It doesn't mean your baby has to die."

24448,jon snow,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH,She shouldn't be alone.
24449,varys,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH,You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.
24450,jon snow,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH,Aren't you worried for her?
24451,varys,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH,"I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath."
24452,jon snow,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH,We're not much for riddles where I'm from.
24453,varys,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH,We both know what she's about to do.

24458,jon snow,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH,I don't want it. I never have.
24459,varys,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH,"(Sighs.) I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true"

24462,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,There's something you need to know.
24463,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,Someone has betrayed me.
24464,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,Yes.
24465,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,Jon Snow.
24466,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,Varys.
24467,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,He knows the truth about Jon.
24468,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,He does.
24469,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,"Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me."
24470,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
24471,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,And Varys?
24472,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
24473,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,(angrily) You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.
24474,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,It was a mistake.
24475,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?
24476,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,She trusts me.
24477,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,"Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down."
24478,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,"If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone."

24480,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_2,No. It doesn't matter now.
24481,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,CAVERNS BENEATH DRAGONSTONE,It was me.

24485,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT",This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.

24487,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT",What did I say would happen if you told your sister?
24488,jon snow,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT","I don't want it, and that's what I told him."
24489,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT",She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.
24490,jon snow,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT",I love you. And you will always be my queen.

24495,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT","In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived."
24496,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT",They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.
24497,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT",They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?
24498,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT",What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
24499,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT",Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.

24501,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT",But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.

24504,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT",Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.
24505,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT",Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.
24506,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT",It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.

24530,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT,Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.
24531,unsullied,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT,We have orders to guard the prisoner.
24532,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT,Ordered by whom? The queen herself?

24535,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,How did they find you?
24536,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,Did you consider taking it off?
24537,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,"Cersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister."""
24538,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,"And you're going back to her, to die with her."
24539,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,You've underestimated her before.
24540,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
24541,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,Difficult to do from here.
24542,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?
24543,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,"Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise."
24544,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,"To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise."
24545,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.
24546,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,"The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win."
24547,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,"She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be."
24548,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.
24549,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,The city will fall tomorrow.

24551,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.
24552,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,"Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before."
24553,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,Why?
24554,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,"Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life."
24555,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-
24556,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,"There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again."
24557,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,Swear to me.
24558,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,You have my word.
24559,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,"If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered."
24560,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,I'll try.
24561,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,"I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates."
24562,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,Your queen will execute you for this.
24563,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,"If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible."
24564,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,"Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never would've survived my childhood."
24565,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,You would have.
24566,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT,You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.

24703,sandor clegane,8,72,the bells,THE MAP COURTYARD OF THE RED KEEP,Or maybe that dragon will eat her. It doesn't matter. She's dead. And you'll be dead too if you don't get out of here.

24751,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,RED KEEP CELLAR,It's all right.
24752,cersei lannister,8,72,the bells,RED KEEP CELLAR,Please don't let me die.
24753,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,RED KEEP CELLAR,It's all right.

24755,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,RED KEEP CELLAR,Just look- Look at me. Look at me.
24756,cersei lannister,8,72,the bells,RED KEEP CELLAR,Not like this. Not like this. Not like this.
24757,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,RED KEEP CELLAR,Look- Look- Look me in the eye. Don't look away. Don't look- Look at me! Just look at me.
24758,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,RED KEEP CELLAR,Nothing else matters. Nothing else matters. Only us.
24759,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE RUINS OF KING'S LANDING, DAY",I'll find you later.
24760,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,"THE RUINS OF KING'S LANDING, DAY",It's not safe. Let me send some men with you.
24761,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE RUINS OF KING'S LANDING, DAY",I'm going alone.
24762,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_27,"In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen, I sentence you to die."
24763,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_27,Grey Worm!
24764,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_27,It's over.
24765,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_27,These men are prisoners. It is not over until the queen's enemies are defeated.
24766,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_27,How much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.
24767,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_27,They are breathing.
24768,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_27,"Look around you, friend. We won."
24769,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_27,"I obey my queen's commands, not yours."
24770,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_27,And what are the queen's commands?
24771,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_27,"""Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister."" These are free men. They chose to fight for her."
24772,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_27,"Easy, men. Easy! Easy."
24773,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING_27,Jon. We should speak with the queen.
24774,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,(in Dothraki) Blood of my blood.
24775,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.
24776,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms.
24777,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,Torgo Nudho.
24778,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,"(in Valyrian) You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War."
24779,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,(in Valyrian) Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!
24780,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,(in Valyrian) But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!
24781,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,"(in Valyrian) From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel."
24782,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,(in Valyrian) Will you break the wheel with me?
24783,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,You freed your brother. You committed treason.
24784,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.
24785,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,(In Valyrian) Take him.
24786,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,What are you doing here?
24787,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,"Hey, what happened?"
24788,arya stark,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.
24789,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,(sighs) She's everyone's queen now.
24790,arya stark,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,Try telling Sansa.
24791,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.
24792,arya stark,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE,Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.
24793,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,Did you bring any wine?
24794,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,No.
24795,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, ""See, I told you."" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going."
24796,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,(sighs)
24797,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,So is there life after death?
24798,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,Not that I've seen.
24799,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.
24800,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,You didn't.
24801,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not."
24802,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.
24803,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?"
24804,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.
24805,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today."
24806,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
24807,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister."
24808,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day."
24809,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,Cersei left her no choice.
24810,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"The moment the gates fell, the battle was over."
24811,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
24812,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,And she burned down a city for it.
24813,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield."
24814,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,Would you have done it?
24815,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,What?
24816,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?"
24817,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,I don't know.
24818,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"(scoffs) Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know."
24819,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,What's it matter what I'd do?
24820,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men."
24821,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,(sighs)
24822,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
24823,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.
24824,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"""Love is the death of duty."""
24825,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,You just came up with that?
24826,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
24827,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"
24828,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?
24829,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,That's her decision. She is the queen.
24830,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,I'm sorry it came to this.
24831,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?
24832,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
24833,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
24834,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,She doesn't get to choose.
24835,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL,No. But you do. And you have to choose now.
24836,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,"When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet."
24837,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
24838,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,It was necessary.
24839,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,"Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!"
24840,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.
24841,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,And Tyrion?
24842,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,"He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?"
24843,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,Forgive him.
24844,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,I can't.
24845,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,"You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand."
24846,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,"Please, Dany."
24847,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.
24848,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.
24849,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.
24850,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?
24851,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,Because I know what is good. And so do you.
24852,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,I don't.
24853,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,You do. You do. You've always known.
24854,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.
24855,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,They don't get to choose.
24856,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,"Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastard's name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together."
24857,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_5,"You are my queen. Now, and always."
24858,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",Where's Jon?
24859,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",He is our prisoner.
24860,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.
24861,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",We will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.
24862,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest."
24863,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.
24864,yara greyjoy,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
24865,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",You swore to follow a tyrant.
24866,yara greyjoy,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves."
24867,arya stark,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.
24868,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?"
24869,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","If it weren't for you and your men, we would've lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way."
24870,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",We do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.
24871,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",It's not for you to decide.
24872,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.
24873,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",(nods) You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.
24874,yohn royce,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",We don't have a king or queen.
24875,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.
24876,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","Make your choice, then."
24877,edmure tully,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",My lords and ladies.  I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives. What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history. I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country. A veteran of two wars. And I like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst-
24878,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",Uncle? Please sit.
24879,yohn royce,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","Well, we have to choose someone."
24880,sam,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",Why just us?
24881,sam,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone."
24882,edmure tully,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.
24883,yohn royce,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",I'll ask my horse.
24884,edmure tully,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",(to TYRION) I suppose you want the crown.
24885,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",Me? The Imp?
24886,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her."
24887,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",Can't think of a worse choice.
24888,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","Who, then?"
24889,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.
24890,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?"
24891,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
24892,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break."
24893,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm."
24894,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?"
24895,bran stark,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",Why do you think I came all this way?
24896,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.
24897,sam,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",Aye.
24898,edmure tully,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",Aye.

24908,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye."
24909,brienne of tarth,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",Aye.
24910,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years."
24911,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
24913,bran stark,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","Lord Tyrion, you will be my Hand."
24914,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","N- No, Your Grace, I don't want it."
24915,bran stark,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",And I don't want to be king.
24916,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else."
24917,bran stark,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",I choose you.
24918,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",You cannot.
24919,bran stark,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY","Yes, I can. I'm king."
24920,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",This man is a criminal. He deserves justice.
24921,bran stark,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",He just got it. He's made many terrible mistakes. He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.
24922,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"THE DRAGON PIT, DAY",(shakes his head) It is not enough.
24923,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL,Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.
24924,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL,There's still a Night's Watch?
24925,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL,The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.
24926,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL,(sighs)
24927,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL,"You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose."
24928,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL,Was it right? What I did?
24929,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL,What we did.
24930,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL,It doesn't feel right.
24931,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL,Ask me again in ten years.
24932,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL,I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.
24933,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL,I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.
24934,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL,(nods)
24935,unsullied captain,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING WHARFS,(in Valyrian) All the men have boarded.
24936,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING WHARFS,(in Valyrian) Good. We sail for the isle of Naath.
24937,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?
24938,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,"The North is free, thanks to you."
24939,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,But they lost their king.
24940,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.
24941,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,"You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black."
24942,arya stark,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,I can't.
24943,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?
24944,arya stark,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,(chuckles) I'm not going back north.
24945,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,Where are you going?
24946,arya stark,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,What's west of Westeros?
24947,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,(chuckles) I don't know.
24948,arya stark,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.
24949,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,You have your Needle?
24950,arya stark,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,Right here.
24951,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,Your Grace.
24952,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.
24953,bran stark,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL,You were exactly where you were supposed to be.
24954,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,That's not- Uh-
24955,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,What's this?
24956,sam,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.
24957,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.
24958,sam,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"Oh, I wouldn't say that."
24959,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"Oh, he's kind to me. Never would've guessed."
24960,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,He's not kind?
24961,sam,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,He-
24962,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,He what? What does he say about me?
24963,sam,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem."
24964,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,Your Grace.
24965,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,Your Grace.
24966,bronn,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,Your Grace.
24967,sam,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,Your Grace.
24968,bran stark,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,We appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers. And a Master of Laws. And a Master of War.
24969,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks."
24970,bran stark,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,And Drogon? Any word?

24972,bronn,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"The farther away, the better."
24973,bran stark,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,Perhaps I can find him. Do carry on with the rest.
24974,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"As you wish, Your Grace."
24975,brienne of tarth,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,Ser Podrick.
24976,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"(clearing his throat) We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign."
24977,sam,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,Long may he reign.
24978,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,Long may he reign.
24979,brienne of tarth,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,Long may he reign.
24980,bronn,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,Long may he reign.
24981,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,That will improve.
24982,bran stark,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,(smiling) I'm sure it will.
24983,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?"
24984,bronn,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"In full, my lord Hand."
24985,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?
24986,bronn,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,Indeed we can.
24987,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair."
24988,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.
24989,bronn,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin."
24990,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"""Any more."""
24991,bronn,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,You Master of Grammar now too?
24992,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population."
24993,sam,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-
24994,bronn,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,The strong live and the weak don't.
24995,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,Find the best builders and set them to the task.
24996,bronn,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction."
24997,sam,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,Uh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.
24998,bronn,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,"Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly."
24999,brienne of tarth,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.
25000,bronn,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,I think that's a very presumptuous statement.
25001,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_4,I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
