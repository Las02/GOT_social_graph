0,waymar royce,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,"What d'you expect? They're savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they're ripping each other to pieces."
1,will,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,"I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I've never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life."
2,waymar royce,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,How close did you get?
3,will,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,Close as any man would.
4,gared,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,We should head back to the wall.
5,yohn royce,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,Do the dead frighten you?
6,gared,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won't trouble us no more.
7,yohn royce,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,You don't think he'll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
8,will,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.
9,yohn royce,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,"It's a good thing we're not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter ... If I don't catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won't say it again."
10,yohn royce,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
11,will,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,They were here.
12,gared,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,See where they went.
13,yohn royce,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,What is it?
14,gared,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene,It's ...
15,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,Go on. Father's watching.
16,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,And your mother.
17,mordane,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,"Fine work, as always. Well done."
18,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,Thank you.
19,mordane,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,I love the detail that you've managed to get in this corners. ... Quite beautiful ... the stitching ...
20,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,"And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on."
21,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,"Don't think too much, Bran."
22,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,Relax your bow arm.
24,rodrik cassel,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch.
25,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,Get the lads to saddle their horses.
26,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,Do you have to?
27,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,"He swore an oath, Cat."
28,rodrik cassel,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,"The law is law, my lady."
29,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,"Tell Bran he's coming, too."
30,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.
31,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,He won't be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
32,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_1,"Lad, go run back and get the rest."
33,will,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them."
34,will,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"I know I broke my oath. And I know I'm a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I'm no coward. Tell them I'm sorry."
35,will,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"Forgive me, lord."
36,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name ..."
37,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Don't look away.
38,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,King of the Andals and the First Men ...
39,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Father will know if you do.
40,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die."
41,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,You did well.
42,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,You understand why I did it?
43,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Jon said he was a deserter.
44,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,But do you understand why I had to kill him?
45,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Our way is the old way?
46,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
47,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
48,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
49,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,So he was lying?
50,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,A madman sees what he sees.
51,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,What is it?
52,theon greyjoy,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Mountain lion?
53,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,There are no mountain lions in these woods.
54,theon greyjoy,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,It's a freak.
55,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,It's a direwolf.
56,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Tough old beast.
57,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
58,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Now there are five.
59,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,You want to hold it?
60,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Where will they go? Their mother's dead.
61,rodrik cassel,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,They don't belong down here.
62,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Better a quick death. They won't last without their mother.
63,theon greyjoy,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Right. Give it here.
64,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,NO!
65,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Put away your blade.
66,theon greyjoy,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"I take orders from your father, not you."
67,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"Please, father!"
68,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"I'm sorry, Bran."
69,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
70,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves."
71,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,What about you?
72,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,I'm not a Stark. Get on.
73,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,What is it?
74,theon greyjoy,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"The runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow."
75,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you"
76,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid."
77,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools."
78,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,What if Jon Arryn told someone?
79,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,But who would he tell?
80,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,My husband.
81,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on."
82,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,You should be the Hand of the king.
83,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short."
84,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
85,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,You have five northern children. You're not an outsider.
86,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,I wonder if the old gods agree.
87,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,It's your gods with all the rules.
88,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"I am so sorry, my love."
89,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Tell me.
90,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
91,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Your sister. The boy ...
92,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
93,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"He's coming this far North, there's only one thing he's after."
94,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"You can always say no, Ned."
95,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.
96,luwin,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,I'm told he drinks all night.
97,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,How much could he possibly drink? A man of his ... stature.
98,luwin,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.
99,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"In any case, candles."
100,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
101,theon greyjoy,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's [sleek as a mink?]"
102,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
103,theon greyjoy,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
104,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair."
105,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!"
106,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,I saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!
107,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,How many times have I told you
108,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,But he's coming right now! Down our road!
109,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,I want you to promise me
110,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,I promise.
111,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,D'you know what?
112,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,What?
113,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
114,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?"
115,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA's helm]"
116,arya stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Move!
117,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Your Grace.
118,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,You've got fat.
119,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Cat!
120,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Your Grace.
121,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Nine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
122,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours."
123,arya stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Where's the Imp?
124,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Will you shut up?
125,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"Who have we here? You must be Robb. (To Sansa) My, you're a pretty one. (To Arya) Your name is?"
126,arya stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Arya.
127,arya stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,That's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.
128,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Would you please shut up.
129,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,My queen.
130,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,My queen.
131,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
132,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait."
133,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Ned.
134,arya stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Where's the Imp?
135,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
136,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Tell me about Jon Arryn.
137,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"One minute he was fine, and then ... Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man."
138,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,We both did.
139,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"He never had to teach you much, but me ... You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what."
140,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Aye.
141,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. (They laugh. ROBERT sighs.) I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king."
142,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,I'm not worthy of the honor.
143,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses."
144,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
145,ros,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?
146,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,I did hear something about that.
147,ros,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
148,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,And the other brother?
149,ros,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,The queen has two brothers?
150,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.
151,ros,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,I hear they call him the Imp.
152,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,I hear he hates that nickname.
153,ros,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
154,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Clever girl.
155,ros,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion."
156,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Have you?
157,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,The gods gave me one blessing.
158,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Don't get up.
159,ros,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,M'lord.
160,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
161,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention."
162,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"She has odd cravings, our sister."
163,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people."
164,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses."
165,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, (he opens the door; a bevy of whores enter and descend on TYRION) Come on, girls. See you at sundown."
166,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Close the door!
167,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
168,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
169,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,She belonged with me.
170,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"In my dreams, I kill him every night."
171,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,"It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone."
172,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_2,Not all of them.
173,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3,Daenerys!
174,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3,Daenerys! There's our bride to be! Look - a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?
175,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3,We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
176,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3,"Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. (He pulls off her gown.) You have a woman's body now. (She endures it as he strokes her breast.) I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?"
177,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3,No.
178,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_3,"When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today."
180,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Where is he?
181,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
182,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,"(Greets them in Dothraki.) May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen."
183,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,"Come forward, my dear."
184,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Where's he going?
185,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,The ceremony is over.
186,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?
187,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,"Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know."
188,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
189,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,When will they be married?
190,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
191,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Is it true they lie with their horses?
192,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
193,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Do you take me for a fool?
194,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.
195,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
196,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,"So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?"
197,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,I don't know.
198,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,"We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took."
199,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?
200,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
201,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,He's so handsome.
202,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
203,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
204,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
205,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.
206,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
207,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Sansa...
208,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,"Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted."
209,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Is he dead yet?
210,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Uncle Benjen!
211,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?
212,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
213,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,"Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there."
214,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,So take me with you when you go back.
215,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Jon...
216,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,"Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will."
217,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,The Wall isn't going anywhere.
218,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,I'm ready to swear your oath.
219,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
220,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,I don't care about that.
221,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,"You might, if you knew what it meant. ... I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later."
222,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
223,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,What're you doing back there?
224,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.
225,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?
226,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,"My greatest accomplishment. You - you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?"
227,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,"Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though."
228,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
229,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,"And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you."
230,jon snow,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
231,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_4,All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.
232,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,You at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.
233,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
234,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger."
235,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
236,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,The two he was with are still missing.
237,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,A wildling ambush.
238,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
239,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Winter is coming.
240,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Uncle Benjen.
241,benjen stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Robb boy. How are ye?
242,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,I'm good.
243,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Yes. Lovely country.
244,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time."
245,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?"
246,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"Thirteen, Your Grace."
247,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,You're tall. Still growing?
248,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"I think so, Your Grace."
249,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,And have you bled yet?
250,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"No, Your Grace."
251,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,And your dress. Did you make it?
252,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Such talent. You must make something for me.
253,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
254,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,I hear the same.
255,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
256,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Your pardon.
257,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.
258,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"Yes, the king has honored me with his offer."
259,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale."
260,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,I don't fight in tournaments.
261,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,No? Getting a little old for it?
262,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do."
263,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Well said.
264,sansa stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Arya!
265,robb stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Time for bed.
266,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"I'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital."
267,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,I won't let him take you.
268,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.
269,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"I'll say, 'Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'"
270,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,How did he get so fat?
271,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.
273,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Send him in.
274,luwin,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister."
275,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Stay.
276,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,This was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.
277,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,What news?
278,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
279,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying."
280,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?"
281,luwin,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?"
282,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
283,luwin,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord."
284,catelyn stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. (To NED) Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.
285,luwin,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,A different time. Different king.
286,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
287,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it."
288,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,When?
289,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,When their omens favour war.
290,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
291,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
292,jorah mormont,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
293,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?"
294,jorah mormont,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king."
295,illyrio mopatis,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"Dragons' eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful."
296,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"Thank you, Magister."
297,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"She's beautiful. ... Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say 'thank you' in Dothraki."
298,jorah mormont,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,There is no word for 'thank you' in Dothraki.
299,varys,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Make him happy.
300,khal drogo,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,No.
301,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Do you know the Common Tongue?
302,khal drogo,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,No.
303,daenerys targaryen,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Is 'no' the only word that you know?
304,khal drogo,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,No.
305,sandor clegane,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"Rough night, Imp?"
306,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle."
307,sandor clegane,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,I didn't pick you for a hunter.
308,tyrion lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
309,sandor clegane,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,It's not hunting if you pay for it.
310,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
311,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"No, but I'm still better than you."
312,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,I know what I'm putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You're a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I've got.
313,eddard stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,I hope I'll serve you well.
314,robert baratheon,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"You will. And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!"
315,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"Come on, you."
316,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Stop. STOP.
317,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Are you completely mad?
318,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,He saw us.
319,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,It's all right. It's all right.
320,cersei lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,He saw us!
321,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,"I heard you the first time. (To BRAN) Quite the little climber, aren't you? How old are you, boy?"
322,bran stark,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Ten
323,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,Ten.
324,jaime lannister,1,1,winter is coming,Unnamed Scene_5,The things I do for love.
325,jorah mormont,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"You need to drink, child... And eat."
326,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Isn't there anything else?
327,jorah mormont,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,The Dothraki have two things in abundance
328,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Khaleesi!
329,irri,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Your hands.
330,jorah mormont,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there."
331,viys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
332,jorah mormont,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"As you wish, your Grace."
333,viys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?"
334,jorah mormont,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
335,viys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that."
336,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today."
337,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies."
338,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,What good will my sympathies do them?
339,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
340,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
341,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,One word and I'll hit you again.
342,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I'm telling mother!
343,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?"
344,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,You can't...
345,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Do you understand?
346,sandor clegane,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"The Prince will remember that, little lord."
347,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast..."
348,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black."
349,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Little brother.
350,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Beloved siblings.
351,myrcella baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Is Bran going to die?
352,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Apparently not.
353,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,What do you mean?
354,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,The Maester says the boy may live.
355,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
356,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
357,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
358,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers."
359,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
360,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
361,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
362,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day."
363,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say."
364,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on."
365,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family."
366,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Please.
367,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"I would have dressed, your Grace."
368,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now."
369,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I never knew.
370,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."
371,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I am grateful..
372,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Perhaps this time she'll listen.
373,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,A sword for the wall?
374,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I already have one.
375,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Good man. Have you swung it yet?
376,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Of course I have.
377,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."
378,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
379,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Is it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?"
380,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Soon enough.
381,jaime lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life."
382,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway."
383,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,It's good you've got help.
384,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Watch. Nymeria, gloves."
385,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Impressive.
386,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!"
387,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
388,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,A present?
389,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
390,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,It's so skinny.
391,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."
392,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I can be quick.
393,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
394,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I think so.
395,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,First lesson
396,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I know which end to use.
397,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know."
398,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
399,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I came to say goodbye to Bran.
400,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,You've said it.
401,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."
402,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I want you to leave.
403,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
404,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I have no choice.
405,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't."
406,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,You can. You must.
407,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
408,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,You Starks are hard to kill.
409,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,My mother?
410,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,She was very kind.
411,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."
412,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,It was always my color.
413,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Farewell, Snow."
414,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"And you, Stark."
415,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood."
416,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?"
417,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise."
418,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going."
419,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I've half a mind to go with you.
420,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight."
421,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,You should have asked me 20 years ago.
422,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young."
423,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I recall a few chances.
424,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in."
425,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Bessie. She was one of yours.
426,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastard's mother?
427,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Wylla.
428,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
429,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Nor will I.
430,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already."
431,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
432,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night."
433,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
434,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
435,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,She's little more than a child.
436,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
437,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Tell me we're not speaking of this.
438,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on."
439,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?"
440,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."
441,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert."
442,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him."
443,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea."
444,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming."
445,benjen stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
446,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
447,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Why do you read so much?
448,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Look at me and tell me what you see.
449,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Is this a trick?
450,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."
451,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Until your brother killed that King.
452,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"
453,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
454,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms."
455,jon snow,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
456,tyrion lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly."
457,luwin,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us."
458,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Talk to Poole about it.
459,luwin,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention..."
460,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I don't care about appointments!
461,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
462,luwin,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Very good, my Lord. My Lady."
463,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,When was the last time you left this room?
464,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I have to take care of him.
465,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed."
466,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
467,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying..."
468,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop! (Wolf s howling repeatedly)
469,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
470,assassin,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
471,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,No!
472,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Have you ever seen a dragon?
473,irri,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Dragon gone, Khaleesi."
474,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Everywhere? Even in the east?
475,irri,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
476,jhiqui,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,It is known.
477,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
478,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,The moon?
479,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire."
480,irri,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
481,jhiqui,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,It is known.
482,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
483,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy."
484,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,How old were you?
485,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
486,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Nine?!
487,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn."
488,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
489,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Yes.
490,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Will it take three years?
491,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,No.
492,benjen stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Welcome.
493,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
494,luwin,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,The boy was always sure-footed before.
495,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
496,theon greyjoy,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Saw what, my lady?"
497,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
498,rodrik cassel,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him."
499,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
500,theon greyjoy,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
501,luwin,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this."
502,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
503,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I'll ride to King's Landing.
504,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
505,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Mother, you can't."
506,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I must.
507,rodrik cassel,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
508,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
509,rodrik cassel,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
510,robb stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,What about Bran?
511,catelyn stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
512,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes."
513,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Finish a man?
514,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
515,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top."
516,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you."
517,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
518,doreah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?"
519,daenerys targaryen,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
520,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Pardon me, Ser."
521,sandor clegane,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face."
522,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?"
523,sandor clegane,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
524,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me."
525,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts."
526,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
527,mycah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I'll get you!
528,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Arya!
529,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,What are you doing here? Go away.
530,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Your sister? And who are you, boy?"
531,mycah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Mycah, my Lord."
532,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,He the butcher's boy.
533,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,He's my friend.
534,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are."
535,mycah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to."
536,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword."
537,mycah,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick."
538,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?"
539,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Stop it!
540,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Arya, stay out of this."
541,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
542,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!"
543,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"I'll gut you, you little cunt!"
544,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Arya!
545,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Nymeria!
546,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Please don't.
547,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help."
548,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Then go! Don't touch me.
550,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
554,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Go!
555,jory cassel,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
556,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Where is she?
557,jory cassel,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,She's been taken directly before the King.
558,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Who took her?
559,jory cassel,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,The Lannisters found her.
560,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Right, get back."
561,jory cassel,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
562,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Back! Back to the inn. All back!
563,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I'm sorry.
564,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Are you hurt?
565,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,No.
566,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
567,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
568,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly."
569,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
570,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
571,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
572,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,That's not what happened!
573,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
574,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Liar!
575,joffrey baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Shut up!
576,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?"
577,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,In bed asleep.
578,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"She's not. Sansa, come here, darling."
579,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King."
580,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
581,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Liar! Liar liar liar!
582,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Arya!
583,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Stop it! That's enough of that.
584,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Liar liar liar!
585,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Stop! Arya!
586,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
587,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over."
588,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
589,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
590,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Gladly, your Grace."
591,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
592,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,I'd forgot the damned wolf.
594,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,So be it.
595,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,We have another wolf.
596,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,As you will.
597,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,You can't mean it.
598,robert baratheon,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
599,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!"
600,arya stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
601,sansa stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
602,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,s this your command... your Grace?
603,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Where is the beast?
605,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"Ser Ilyn, do me the honor."
606,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,"No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself."
607,cersei lannister,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,Is this some trick?
608,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
609,eddard stark,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
610,sandor clegane,1,2,the kingsroad,Unnamed Scene_6,He ran... Not very fast.
612,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them."
613,jory cassel,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Yes, my Lord."
615,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership."
616,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
617,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes."
618,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
619,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss."
620,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
621,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."
622,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,But you just stood there and watched.
623,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."
624,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
625,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"
626,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"You served him well, when serving was safe."
627,varys,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Lord Stark.
628,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Lord Varys.
629,varys,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
630,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
631,renly baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but..."
632,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."
633,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well."
634,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
635,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
636,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
637,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."
638,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Grand Maester.
639,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,How many years has it been? You were a young man.
640,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,And you served another King.
641,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?"
642,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Without the King?
643,renly baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."
644,varys,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
645,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,We are the lords of small matters here.
646,renly baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
647,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Mmm, how much?"
648,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer."
649,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Can the treasury bear such expense?
650,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
651,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
652,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
653,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,How could you let this happen?
654,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
655,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
656,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen."
657,renly baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"""Counting coppers,"" he calls it."
658,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
659,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
660,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride."
661,varys,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."
662,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Please, it's nearly healed."
663,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It's ugly.
664,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."
665,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."
666,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
667,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Do I have to marry her?
668,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
669,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I don't want to.
670,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
671,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
672,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,How would you handle them?
673,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."
674,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,A royal army?
675,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives."
676,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,And if the northerners rebel?
677,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe."
678,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
679,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,For me. I'm their King.
680,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
681,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'm not asking.
682,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."
683,joffrey baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
684,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
685,mordane,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food."
686,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'm practicing.
687,sansa stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Practicing for what?
688,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The Prince.
689,mordane,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Arya, stop!"
690,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
691,sansa stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The Hound killed your friend.
692,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
693,sansa stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You're an idiot.
694,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive."
695,mordane,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Enough!
696,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,What's happening here?
697,mordane,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
698,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love"
699,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
700,sansa stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
701,mordane,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You've barely eaten a thing.
702,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It's all right. Go on.
703,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,War was easier than daughters.
704,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Go away!
705,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?"
706,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Mine.
707,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
708,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
709,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Come here. Now what do you want with this?
710,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It's called Needle.
711,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
712,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Stick 'em with the pointy end.
713,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,[laughs] That's the essence of it.
714,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
715,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy."
716,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa."
717,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
718,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,So was I! He is a liar.
719,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong."
720,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,But how you can let her marry someone like that?
721,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Well  Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
722,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Winter is coming.
723,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister."
724,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I don't hate her. Not really.
725,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours."
726,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I can keep it?
727,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."
728,old nan,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
729,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I hate your stories.
730,old nan,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
731,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
732,old nan,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds"
733,robb stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,What are you telling him now?
734,old nan,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
735,robb stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
736,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Maybe we do.
737,robb stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall."
738,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead."
739,robb stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Don't ever say that.
740,bran stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'd rather be dead.
741,rodrik cassel,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many."
742,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
743,rodrik cassel,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,My Lady.
745,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I would. We've done nothing wrong.
747,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."
749,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Cat! Go on. Go upstairs. (to his whores)
750,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a
751,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
752,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
753,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
754,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
755,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,A dear friend told me.
756,varys,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Lady Stark.
757,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Lord Varys.
758,varys,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
759,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,How did you know I was coming?
760,varys,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
761,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Do you know whose dagger this is?
762,varys,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I must admit I do not.
763,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."
764,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Yours?
765,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
766,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,To whom?
767,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
772,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,A charming man.
773,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
774,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
775,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
776,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Good news or bad?
777,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Both.
778,pycelle,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
779,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
780,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,My wife is in Winterfell.
781,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Is she?
782,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
783,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You're a funny man. A very funny man.
784,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Ned! [poking her head out of a window]
785,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds."
786,grenn,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"You broke my nose, bastard!"
787,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It's an improvement.
788,grenn,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit."
789,pypar,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
790,grenn,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"What're you looking at, halfman?"
791,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
792,rast,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,What do you care about our faces?
793,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
794,grenn,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"We'll talk later, Lord Snow."
795,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
796,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice
797,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,They hate me because I'm better than they are.
798,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
799,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
800,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,We have proof. We have the blade.
801,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."
802,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
803,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."
804,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
805,petyr baelish,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
806,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,How could you be so stupid?
807,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Calm down.
808,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
809,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
810,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
811,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Then what are you raving about?
812,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
813,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
814,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,And my husband?
815,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us
816,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Let me go.
817,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Never.
818,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Let me go.
819,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
820,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I wish I could see the girls.
821,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It's too dangerous.
822,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Just for a moment.
823,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Until we know who our enemies are...
824,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."
825,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
826,cersei lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,And if you find the proof?
827,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."
828,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
829,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,He still loves you.
830,catelyn stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Does he?
831,eddard stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Off with you.
832,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
833,barristan selmy,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Of course, your Grace."
834,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Who was it?
835,barristan selmy,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
836,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,How'd you do it?
837,barristan selmy,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Lance through the heart.
838,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?"
839,lancel lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"It's empty, your Grace."
840,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,What do you mean it's empty?
841,lancel lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,There's no more wine.
842,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
843,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
844,barristan selmy,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old."
845,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
846,barristan selmy,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."
847,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Your outlaw... Any last words?
848,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I cut his head off, so no."
849,robert baratheon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
850,jaime lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace..."
851,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,
852,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
853,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,From whom?
854,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices"
855,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Tell them all to stop.
856,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
857,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Until I command them otherwise.
858,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You're learning to talk like a Queen.
859,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
860,viys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
861,irri,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
862,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,No!
863,irri,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."
864,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed."
865,viys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
866,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?"
867,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You walk. [to Viserys]
868,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
869,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You're leaving?
870,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
871,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,What kind of reports?
872,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The kind I don't want to believe.
873,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,'m ready. I won't let you down.
874,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon."
875,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,But I'm better than every...
876,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return."
877,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,A bear's balls.
878,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,You're joking?
879,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
880,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,And how do a bear's balls taste?
881,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"
882,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
883,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
884,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
885,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"
886,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
887,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."
888,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
889,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Call me what you like.
890,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
891,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."
892,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
893,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."
894,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm."
895,benjen stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Enjoy the capital, brother."
896,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I always do.
897,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
898,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
899,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
900,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
901,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
902,yoren,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord."
903,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
904,irri,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Yes, Khaleesi."
905,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,What are you doing?
906,irri,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It s a blessing from the Great Stallion."
907,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."
908,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Dothraki don t wear steel dresses.
909,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Armor.
910,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
911,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Slow.
912,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Slow.
913,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"It's true, but it also keeps a man alive."
914,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
915,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I ve heard that your father was a famous warrior.
916,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?"
917,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
918,irri,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
919,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,There are no rabbits.
920,irri,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Find some ducks, she likes ducks."
921,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?"
922,irri,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
923,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I don't think she wants to eat dog.
924,irri,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
925,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,A blessing from the Great Stallion.
926,irri,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,She does not want to eat horse.
927,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
928,rakharo,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
929,jorah mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
930,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
931,aemon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"
932,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Eight... no, nine."
933,aemon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,All of them brief?
934,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
935,aemon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually
936,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers."
937,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
938,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
939,aemon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
940,jeor mormont,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
941,aemon,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready."
942,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It s a boy.
943,khal drogo,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,How do you know?
944,daenerys targaryen,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I know.
945,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
946,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
947,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
948,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
949,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
950,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Of course.
951,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,He'll never walk again.
952,tyrion lannister,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."
953,jon snow,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Farewell, My Lord."
954,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday."
955,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,Who are you?
956,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Your dancing master, Syrio Forel."
957,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it."
958,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It's too heavy.
959,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
960,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,What if I drop it?
961,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."
962,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,I'm a girl.
963,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding..."
964,arya stark,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,A needle.
965,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Ahhh  Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me."
966,syrio forel,1,3,lord snow,Unnamed Scene_7,"Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster."
967,old nan,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,The little Lord's been dreaming again.
968,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,We have visitors.
969,bran stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I don't want to see anyone.
970,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting."
971,bran stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I don't want to go.
972,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! (Hodor enters, hoisting up Bran and carrying him away) Help Bran down the hall."
973,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
974,robb stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
975,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
976,robb stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away."
977,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
978,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
979,luwin,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,He has no memory of that day.
980,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Curious.
981,robb stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Why are you here?
982,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
983,bran stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Kneel, Hodor."
984,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Do you like to ride, Bran?"
985,bran stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Yes. Well, I mean I did like to."
986,luwin,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,The boy has lost the use of his legs.
987,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
988,bran stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I'm not a cripple.
989,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
990,bran stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Will I really be able to ride?
991,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
992,robb stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
993,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
994,robb stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
995,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier."
996,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros."
997,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters."
998,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,He's not my master.
999,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?"
1000,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,She wasn't feeling well.
1001,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?"
1002,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,My lady's whereabouts...
1003,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?"
1004,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Must have been a pretty sight.
1005,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."
1006,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,We were outnumbered 10 to one.
1007,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire."
1008,theon greyjoy,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Careful, Imp."
1009,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out."
1010,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it."
1011,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What in seven hells is that?
1012,pypar,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
1014,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black."
1015,rast,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Come to take the black pudding.
1017,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I yield. Please, no more."
1019,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Enough! He yielded.
1021,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Are you sure you want to do this?
1022,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,No. Yield yield yield! I yield.
1024,pypar,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Well fought!
1025,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Piss off.
1026,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Did he hurt you?
1027,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I've had worse.
1028,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.
1029,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself."
1030,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Why didn't you get up and fight?
1031,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I wanted to. I just couldn't.
1032,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Why not?
1033,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I'm a coward. My father always says so.
1034,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,The Wall's no place for cowards.
1035,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.
1036,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.
1037,pypar,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You're too stupid to be a coward.
1038,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You're too stupid to be a...
1039,pypar,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Quick now, before summer's over."
1040,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Come on here!
1041,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.
1042,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.
1043,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.
1044,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army."
1045,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?"
1046,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
1047,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,But if they did?
1048,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different."
1049,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,And you know these men?
1050,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land."
1051,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You sold slaves.
1052,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Aye.
1053,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Why?
1054,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I had no money and an expensive wife.
1055,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,And where is she now?
1056,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"In another place, with another man."
1057,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Your Grace?
1058,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Yes, my dear?"
1059,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,They call you the last dragon...
1060,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,They do.
1061,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You have dragon's blood in your veins?
1062,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,It's entirely possible.
1063,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
1064,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles."
1065,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
1066,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Really? Why dragons?
1067,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy."
1068,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy."
1069,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I was not locked in. I have seen things.
1070,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What have you seen?
1071,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
1072,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,A pirate ship?
1073,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,A dragon.
1074,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen"
1075,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What happened to the skulls?
1076,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind."
1077,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,That's very sad.
1078,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?"
1079,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"No, your Grace. To teach your sister."
1080,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.
1081,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince..."
1082,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What if I have a girl?
1083,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them."
1084,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What if I only have girls?
1085,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I wouldn't worry about that.
1086,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls."
1087,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Yes, but it's highly unlikely."
1088,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,But what if?
1089,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother."
1090,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,And everyone would hate me.
1091,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Nobody could ever hate you.
1092,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Joffrey does.
1093,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...
1094,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Please shut up about it.
1095,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?
1096,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Aegon the Conqueror.
1097,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,And who built the Red Keep?
1098,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Maegor the Cruel.
1099,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,And how many years did it take to build...
1100,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?"
1101,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes."
1102,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,The Mad King.
1103,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Commonly known as the Mad King.
1104,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Why were they killed?
1105,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You should speak to your father about these matters.
1106,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I don't want to speak to my father, ever."
1107,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
1108,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"No, I won't."
1109,janos slynt,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"It's the Hand's tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords."
1110,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.
1111,janos slynt,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters."
1112,varys,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Dreadful.
1113,renly baratheon,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can."
1114,janos slynt,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I need more men.
1115,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
1116,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I will?
1117,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left."
1118,janos slynt,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use."
1119,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"The sooner this is over, the better."
1120,varys,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes."
1121,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
1122,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?"
1123,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"This heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord."
1124,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.
1125,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel."
1126,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Why?
1127,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
1128,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What did Jon want the night before he died?
1129,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,He came inquiring after a book.
1130,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,A book? What book?
1131,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome."
1132,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I'd like to read it.
1133,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"""The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children."""
1134,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"""Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained"
1135,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read."
1136,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
1137,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask."
1138,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Jon's death...
1139,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Such a tragedy.
1140,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
1141,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating"
1142,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"""The seed is strong""? What does that mean?"
1143,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words."
1144,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
1145,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What else could it be?
1146,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Poison.
1147,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
1148,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
1149,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?"
1150,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Everybody knows that.
1151,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know."
1152,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I've taken enough of your time.
1153,pycelle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor..."
1154,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Thank you. I'll find my own way out.
1155,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
1156,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,It's a hard fall down these steps.
1157,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
1158,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Cats? Syrio says
1159,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
1160,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,He's right about that.
1161,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?
1162,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,He needs to get his strength back first.
1163,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"He wants to be a knight of the King s Guard. He can't be one now, can he?"
1164,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
1165,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
1166,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
1167,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,No. That's not me.
1168,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well."
1169,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.
1170,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"No, that's all right. I'm fine."
1171,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You're not. You're freezing.
1172,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I don't like high places.
1173,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?"
1174,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. ""You're almost a man now,"" he said, ""but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,"" he said, ""then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more."" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?"
1175,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Yes, he is."
1176,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I'm not going to get any better, you know?"
1177,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Well  You can't get any worse.
1178,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I hear you're reading a boring book.
1179,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Pycelle talks too much.
1180,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death."
1181,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
1182,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I promised Cat that I'd help you.
1183,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.
1184,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
1185,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Varys or the Queen?
1186,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
1187,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Yes.
1188,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel."
1189,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Why?
1190,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death."
1191,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you."
1192,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
1193,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!
1194,hugh of the vale,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"As you can see, I'm busy."
1195,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard."
1196,hugh of the vale,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser..."
1197,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"No ""ser."" I'm not a knight."
1198,hugh of the vale,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I see. Well, it just so happens that I am."
1199,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see."
1200,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
1201,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where."
1202,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Let them look.
1203,tobho mott,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage."
1204,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What did Lord Arryn want?
1205,tobho mott,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,He always came to see the boy.
1206,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I'd like to see him as well.
1207,tobho mott,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad."
1208,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,This is fine work.
1209,gendry,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,It's not for sale.
1210,tobho mott,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet..."
1211,gendry,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I made it for me.
1212,tobho mott,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Forgive him, my Lord."
1213,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?"
1214,gendry,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"He just asked me questions is all, my Lord."
1215,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What kind of questions?
1216,gendry,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother."
1217,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Your mother?
1218,gendry,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Who she was, what she looked like."
1219,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What did you tell him?
1220,gendry,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.
1221,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me."
1222,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Find anything?
1223,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,King Robert's bastard son.
1224,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,This is for the King from Lord Stark.
1225,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.
1226,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Three? Four?
1227,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
1228,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Forgive me, my Lord..."
1229,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
1230,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"We've met before, you know."
1231,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Have we? Strange, I've forgotten."
1232,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
1233,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,That's where you got your scar?
1234,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
1235,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Vicious sons of whores.
1236,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,They like their bloodshed.
1237,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
1238,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
1239,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
1240,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Theon? He's a good lad.
1241,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I doubt it.
1242,robert baratheon,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.
1243,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
1244,jaime lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I don't serve Lord Stark.
1245,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Where have you been?
1246,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Watch duty. With Sam.
1247,pypar,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Prince Porkchop. Where is he?
1248,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,He wasn't hungry.
1249,pypar,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Impossible!
1250,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him."
1251,rast,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon."
1252,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,No one touches Sam.
1254,grenn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield."
1256,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!
1257,doreah,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked."
1258,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us."
1259,irri,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Yes, Khaleesi."
1260,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Why did you hit her?!
1261,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.
1262,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
1263,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What's this?
1264,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,It's a gift. I had it made for you.
1265,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
1266,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Please.
1267,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,This stinks of manure. All of it.
1268,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Stop - stop it.
1269,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair."
1270,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
1271,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You do not talk back to me!
1272,viys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
1273,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
1274,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
1275,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I wouldn't doubt it.
1276,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
1277,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Sally on the side?
1278,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd."
1279,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
1280,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
1281,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."
1282,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I find that hard to believe.
1283,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
1284,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You didn't know where to put it?
1285,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I know where to put it.
1286,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Was she... Old and ugly?
1287,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
1288,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What color hair?
1289,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Red.
1290,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I like red hair. And her... Her...
1291,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You don't want to know.
1292,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,That good?
1293,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Better.
1294,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
1295,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What's my name?
1296,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Jon Snow?
1297,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,And why is my surname Snow?
1298,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Because... You're a bastard from the north.
1299,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
1300,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,So... You didn't know where to put it?
1302,samwell tarly,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,It is a bit nippy.
1304,jon snow,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I build my own fires.
1306,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I hit him. I hit the dragon.
1307,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
1308,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,He is still the true King.
1309,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,The truth now
1310,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
1311,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play."
1312,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?"
1313,jorah mormont,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Home.
1314,daenerys targaryen,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.
1315,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Lover's quarrel?
1316,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I'm sorry. Do I...?
1317,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known..."
1318,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
1319,arya stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Why do they call you Littlefinger?
1320,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Arya!
1321,mordane,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Don't be rude!
1322,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname."
1323,robert baratheon,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
1324,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Gods, who is that?"
1325,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Hound's older brother.
1326,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,And his opponent?
1327,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
1328,robert baratheon,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!"
1329,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story."
1330,sansa stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I won't tell anyone. I promise.
1331,petyr baelish,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you."
1332,jory cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"My Lord, Her Grace the Queen."
1333,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Your Grace.
1334,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You're missing your tournament.
1335,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
1336,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us   the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
1337,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,She likes it here.
1338,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her."
1339,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,What are you doing here?
1340,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
1341,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise."
1342,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces."
1343,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"If that's my job, then so be it."
1344,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow."
1345,eddard stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace."
1346,cersei lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,As was I.
1347,marillion,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!"
1348,catelyn stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,And to you.
1349,rodrik cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly."
1350,marillion,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?"
1351,rodrik cassel,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,I'd rather throw myself down a well.
1352,marillion,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!"
1353,masha heddle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room."
1354,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room."
1355,masha heddle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Truly, my lord, we have nothing."
1356,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
1357,bronn,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,You can have my room.
1358,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me."
1359,yoren,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"Aye, my Lord."
1360,marillion,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!
1361,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
1362,masha heddle,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Lady Stark.
1363,catelyn stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?"
1364,knight of house whent,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"It is, my Lady."
1365,catelyn stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
1366,knight of house whent,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,She is.
1367,catelyn stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
1368,knight of house bracken,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Our lord is honored by his trust.
1369,tyrion lannister,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this."
1370,catelyn stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,Knight of House Frey
1371,catelyn stark,1,4,cripples bastards and broken things,Unnamed Scene_8,"This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice."
1372,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
1373,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
1374,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,He'd never worn this armor before.
1375,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
1376,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Who determines the draw?
1377,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark."
1378,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters."
1379,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
1380,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her."
1381,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
1382,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
1383,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime."
1384,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
1385,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
1386,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Yes. That will never happen.
1387,barristan selmy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Robert tends to do what he wants.
1388,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion."
1389,lancel lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go."
1390,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
1391,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You're too fat for your armor.
1392,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?"
1393,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Oh, it s funny, is it?"
1394,lancel lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"No, Your Grace."
1395,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,No? You don't like the Hand's joke?
1396,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You're torturing the poor boy.
1397,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!"
1398,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,The breastplate stretcher?
1399,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,How long before he figures it out?
1400,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Maybe you should have one invented.
1401,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance."
1402,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
1403,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
1404,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,And who's going to hit you back?
1405,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
1406,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
1407,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
1408,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Aye.
1409,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Drink.
1410,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I'm not thirsty.
1411,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
1412,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Your squire... A Lannister boy?
1413,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. ""Cersei Lannister will make a good match"", he told me. ""You'll need her father on your side."" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood."
1414,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Robert?
1415,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!"
1416,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Where's Arya
1417,sansa stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.
1418,sansa stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Thank you, Ser Loras."
1419,sansa stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
1420,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Hey.
1421,sansa stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I can't watch.
1422,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
1423,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I'll take that bet.
1424,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
1425,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Or you could even buy a friend.
1426,sansa stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,He's going to die.
1427,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Ser Loras rides well.
1428,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend."
1429,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?"
1430,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really."
1431,sansa stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
1432,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,No honor but quite a bit of gold.
1433,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Stop this madness in the name of your King!
1434,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I owe you my life, Ser."
1435,sandor clegane,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I'm no Ser.
1436,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Remove his hood.
1437,marillion,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold. (singing)"
1438,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
1439,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I did... often and loudly.
1440,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?"
1441,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,And why would I do that?
1442,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
1443,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
1444,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?"
1445,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Five years ago.
1446,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here."
1447,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I am not a murderer, Lannister."
1448,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
1449,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,The dagger found
1450,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
1451,rodrik cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Should I gag him?
1452,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Why? Am I starting to make sense?
1453,rodrik cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"My Lady, this way."
1454,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Untie me. If I die, what's the point?"
1455,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Rodrik?
1456,rodrik cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself."
1457,bronn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
1458,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Well, I'm willing if she is."
1459,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Bran...
1460,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"The Iron Islands. Sigil - a Kraken. Words - ""We do not sow""."
1461,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Lords?
1462,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,The Greyjoys.
1463,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking."
1464,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,And failed rebellions.
1465,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Sigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King.
1466,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Good.
1467,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Words - ""Ours is the fury"". Lords - the Baratheons."
1468,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,
1469,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,The Westerlands - sigil - a lion.
1470,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Hmm...
1471,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Words - ""A Lannister always pays his debts."""
1472,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"No. A common saying, but not their official motto."
1473,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Lords - the Lannisters.
1474,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,We're still on their words.
1475,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I don't know them.
1476,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You do know them. Think.
1477,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"""Unbowed, unbent, unbroken""."
1478,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,That's House Martell.
1479,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"""Righteous in wrath""."
1480,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,House Hornwood.
1481,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"""Family, duty, honor""."
1482,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?
1483,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"""Family, duty, honor""... Is that the right order?"
1484,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You know it is.
1485,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Family comes first?
1486,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
1487,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?"
1488,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
1489,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,And then she left!
1490,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely."
1491,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Why did she leave?
1492,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon."
1493,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Do you know where she is now? Today?
1494,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"No, I don't."
1495,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?
1496,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
1497,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I'll never shoot another arrow.
1498,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,And where is that written?
1499,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You need legs to work a bow.
1500,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback."
1501,bran stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Really?
1502,luwin,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?
1503,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
1504,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
1505,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Important enough for the likes of you.
1506,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know."
1507,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
1508,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Jealous?
1509,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Why should I be jealous?
1510,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
1511,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Might surprise you.
1512,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Hmm?
1513,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
1514,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
1515,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You are jealous.
1516,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."
1517,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,And what about the Starks?
1518,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I ve been Lord Stark s ward since I was eight years old.
1519,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"A  ward , that s a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again"
1520,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
1521,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You re a very serious boy.
1522,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I m not a boy.
1523,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock."
1524,theon greyjoy,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I don t want to pay for it.
1525,ros,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Then get yourself a wife.
1526,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
1527,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"How is your son, my Lord?"
1528,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,He'll never walk again.
1529,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,But his mind is sound?
1530,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,So they say.
1531,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
1532,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
1533,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
1534,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I didn't trust you.
1535,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,So why do you trust me now?
1536,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
1537,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,What sort of doom does the King face?
1538,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
1539,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Who gave it to him?
1540,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
1541,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"The squire, Ser Hugh?"
1542,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
1543,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?"
1544,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Someone who could afford it.
1545,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
1546,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,He started asking questions.
1547,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
1548,illyrio mopatis,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
1549,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
1550,illyrio mopatis,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
1551,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,This Hand is not the other.
1552,illyrio mopatis,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
1553,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"""Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."
1554,illyrio mopatis,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,It never was.
1555,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
1556,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You do move quietly.
1557,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,We all have our qualities.
1558,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
1559,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
1560,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
1561,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
1562,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."
1563,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
1564,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
1565,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
1566,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."
1567,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Strictly speaking.
1568,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."
1569,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
1570,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
1571,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
1572,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Saw me with your own eyes?
1573,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Eyes I own.
1574,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
1575,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
1576,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,One shudders at the thought.
1577,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Oh.
1578,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
1579,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Have you?
1580,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
1581,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Was that you under the bed?
1582,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies  To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
1583,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Oh, please."
1584,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King
1585,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming."
1586,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,To a small council meeting?
1587,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
1589,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I'm not a beggar. I live here.
1591,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I want to see my father.
1594,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
1595,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
1596,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,They said they were going to kill you.
1597,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Who did?
1598,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I didn't see them, but I think one was fat."
1599,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Oh, Arya."
1600,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
1601,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Where did you hear this?
1602,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
1603,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,What were you doing in the dungeons?
1604,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Chasing a cat.
1605,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent."
1606,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Your name, friend?"
1607,yoren,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look."
1608,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I'm a girl!
1609,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Did Benjen send you?
1610,yoren,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."
1611,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Ah, we'll find recruits for you."
1612,yoren,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow."
1613,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Know what?
1614,yoren,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Best said in private, my Lord."
1615,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Go on. We'll talk more later.
1616,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Jory, take her safely to her room."
1617,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Come along, my Lady. You heard your father."
1618,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,How many guards does my father have?
1619,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
1620,arya stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
1621,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"No fear on that count, little Lady."
1622,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Well?
1623,yoren,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp."
1624,vardis egen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"You're far from home, Lady Stark."
1625,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,To whom do I speak?
1626,vardis egen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"
1627,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,There was no time to send word.
1628,vardis egen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?"
1629,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
1630,vardis egen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,He doesn't look like a prisoner.
1631,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,My sister will decide what he looks like.
1632,vardis egen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Yes, my Lady. She will at that."
1633,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
1634,bronn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
1635,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I like you.
1636,steward,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called."
1637,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I need to see the King first -- alone.
1638,steward,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you."
1639,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Is it about my wife?
1640,steward,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."
1641,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,The whore is pregnant.
1642,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You're speaking of murdering a child.
1643,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead."
1644,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
1645,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!"
1646,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Then we're no better than the Mad King.
1647,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Careful, Ned. Careful now."
1648,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
1649,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child."
1650,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Based on whose information?
1651,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
1652,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
1653,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."
1654,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?"
1655,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army  What then?
1656,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
1657,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
1658,varys,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
1659,pycelle,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?"
1660,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,We should have had them both killed years ago.
1661,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it."
1662,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child."
1663,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,She dies.
1664,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I will have no part in it.
1665,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will."
1666,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
1667,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!"
1668,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
1669,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you."
1670,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned."
1671,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,What can I do for you?
1672,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,When do you return to Winterfell?
1673,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Why? What do you care?
1674,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you."
1675,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I don't have the time.
1676,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
1677,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
1678,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Heward and Wyl.
1679,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Find them and meet me at the stables.
1680,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, ""the seed is strong."" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale."
1681,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-"
1682,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
1683,robin arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Mommy? Is that the bad man?
1684,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,It is.
1685,robin arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,He's little.
1686,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
1687,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
1688,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
1689,tyrion lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do."
1690,robin arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!"
1691,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby."
1692,robin arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
1693,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Perhaps you will, my little love."
1694,catelyn stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
1695,lysa arryn,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord."
1696,mord,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!"
1697,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
1698,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man."
1699,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You're jealous.
1700,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Are you sure this won't hurt?
1701,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Only if I slip.
1702,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,And you prefer me like this?
1703,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Mhmm.
1704,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy."
1705,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I want you.
1706,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?"
1707,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Hold still.
1708,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood."
1709,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the m l e.
1710,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
1711,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,He shouldn't have entered the m l e if he didn't know how to fight.
1712,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
1713,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
1714,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you."
1715,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Yes well, I guess we'll never know."
1716,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Everywhere?
1717,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
1718,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
1719,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
1720,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money."
1721,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I have an outrageous amount of money.
1722,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Not as much as the Lannisters.
1723,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,But a lot more than you.
1724,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King."
1725,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Hmm... How did that ever happen?
1726,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
1727,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Do you know who should be King?
1728,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Be serious.
1729,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you."
1730,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I'm fourth in line.
1731,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
1732,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Stannis?
1733,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
1734,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,He's still my older brother.
1735,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,What are you doing?!
1736,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Look at it.
1737,renly baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You cut me!
1738,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you."
1739,loras tyrell,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King."
1740,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
1741,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
1742,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
1743,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
1744,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
1745,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."
1746,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
1747,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out."
1748,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Is my father wrong?
1749,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."
1750,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,We still outnumber them.
1751,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
1752,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Five.
1753,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."
1754,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,What do you want?
1755,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together."
1756,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Our marriage.
1757,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?"
1758,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Every day.
1759,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,How long can hate hold a thing together?
1760,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Well, seventeen years is quite a long time."
1761,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Yes, it is."
1762,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Yes, it tis. What was she like?"
1763,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?"
1764,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
1765,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,So why now?
1766,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
1767,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind."
1768,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"I felt something for you once, you know?"
1769,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I know.
1770,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?"
1771,robert baratheon,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
1772,cersei lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,It doesn't make me feel anything.
1773,mhaegen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair."
1774,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Aye.
1775,mhaegen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is."
1776,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I will.
1777,mhaegen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me."
1778,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?"
1779,mhaegen,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy."
1780,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
1781,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink."
1782,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
1783,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Well, he has more than you, for a start."
1784,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,How many?
1785,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
1786,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
1787,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
1788,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Come.
1789,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Jory!
1790,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,My Lord.
1791,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Such a small pack of wolves.
1792,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!"
1793,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
1794,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"What's the meaning of this, Lannister?"
1795,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."
1796,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,I remember him well.
1797,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?"
1798,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
1799,petyr baelish,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
1800,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand."
1801,jory cassel,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,If you threaten my Lord again...
1802,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of ?"
1803,eddard stark,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"You kill me, your brother's a dead man."
1804,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
1805,jaime lannister,1,5,the wolf and the lion,Unnamed Scene_9,"My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back."
1806,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"Your pardon, your Grace."
1807,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Do you know what your wife has done?
1808,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,She did nothing I did not command.
1809,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Who d have thought she had it in her?
1810,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
1811,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,I am the King s Hand -
1812,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,You were the King s Hand!
1813,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,- trying to keep the peace -
1814,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,You shall now be held accountable.
1815,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you ll make your peace with Jaime."
1816,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,He butchered my men.
1817,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
1818,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"Quiet, woman."
1819,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
1820,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,I took you for a king.
1821,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Hold your tongue.
1822,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,He s attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.
1823,cersei lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
1824,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Wear it in silence or I ll honor you again.
1825,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not  That was not kingly.
1826,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,If we don t act  there will be a war.
1827,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King s Landing. She s had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it."
1828,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
1829,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"I m half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don t know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don t want to know. This is what matters - I can t rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other s throats, so enough!"
1830,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight."
1831,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I m the king, I get what I want  I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it s true. You were the brother I chose. We ll talk when I return from the hunt."
1832,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,The hunt?
1833,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Killing things clears my head. You ll have to sit on the throne while I m away. You ll hate it more than I do.
1834,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,The Targaryen girl -
1835,robert baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"Seven hells! Don t start with her again! The girl will die and I ll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I ll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister."

1842,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Not now.
1843,theon greyjoy,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.
1844,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,You re talking about war.
1845,theon greyjoy,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,I m talking about justice.

1849,theon greyjoy,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,You re not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They ve already started the war. It s your duty to represent your House when your father can t.
1850,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"And it s not your duty, because it s not your House."

1863,osha,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,the boy s worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark s own blood. Think what Mance would give us.

1873,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Have you lost your mind? What if you d missed?
1874,theon greyjoy,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,He would have killed you and cut Bran s throat.
1875,robb stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,You don t have the right -
1876,theon greyjoy,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"To what, to save your brother s life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it."

The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it  How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don t think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don t think I know what you want? I don t care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go."

1926,mord,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,No gold!
1927,tyrion lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession  is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine."

1929,tyrion lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"Where? I don t know where, but when they free me -"

1931,tyrion lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"Have you ever heard the phrase  Rich as a Lannister ? Of course you have. You re a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase,  a Lannister always pays his debts.  If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do."
1932,mord,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,What message?
1933,tyrion lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
1934,lysa arryn,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,You wish to confess your crimes?

1937,tyrion lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I m a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I m not particularly good at violence, but I m good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle s boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and  I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"
1938,lysa arryn,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Silence!
1939,robin arryn,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,What happened next?!

1943,tyrion lannister,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"Oh, I m very sorry. I don t know anything about all that."
1944,lysa arryn,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"You ve had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor."

1986,renly baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?"

1988,renly baratheon,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and  make the eight.

1998,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,You re describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
1999,pycelle,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
2000,petyr baelish,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,I ve heard him called  Tywin Lannister s mad dog.  I m sure you have as well. (whispering to Ned) Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?

2002,petyr baelish,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.

I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death."
2008,pycelle,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,My lord  This  This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert s return.

2012,petyr baelish,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,"A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion s tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers."
2013,eddard stark,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
2014,robin arryn,1,6,a golden crown,Unnamed Scene_10,Is it over?

2142,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,My son saw you with him.
2143,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Do you love your children?
2144,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,With all my heart.
2145,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,No more than I love mine.
2146,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,And they are all Jaime's.
2147,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Thank the Gods. In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways. In the morning, he doesn't remember."
2148,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,You've always hated him.
2149,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Hated him? I worshiped him. Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath. And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and black-bearded, it was the happiest moment of my life. Then that night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine and did what he did, what little he could do, and whispered in my ear, ""Lyanna"". Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me."
2150,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth. You must be gone by then. You and your children. I will not have their blood on my hands. Go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can. Because wherever you go, Robert's wrath will follow you."
2151,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself. Jaime told me about the day King's Landing fell. He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up."
2152,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them."
2153,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Oh, but it was. When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."
2154,ros,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Come here. Oh yes, oh. Oh yes yes yes."
2155,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you-- wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?"
2156,ros,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Yes, My Lord."
2157,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman. Well, go ahead. Slowly. You're not fooling them. They just paid you. They know what you are. They know it's all just an act. Your job is to make them forget what they know. That takes time. You need to Ease into it. Go ahead. Ease into it. He's winning you over in spite of yourself.You're starting to like this. He wants to believe you. He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you? He knows he's better than other men. He's always known it deep down inside. Now he has proof. He's so good, he's reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there."
2158,ros,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Why don't you join us, My Lord?"
2159,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I'm saving myself for another.
2160,ros,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,What she doesn't know won't hurt her.
2161,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,A stupid saying. What we don't know is usually what gets us killed.
2162,ros,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,She must be very beautiful.
2163,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though."
2164,ros,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I do believe my lord's in love.
2165,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,For many years. Most of my life really. Play with her ass.
2166,ros,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Is she still married to him?
2167,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding. And she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen. She loves him, I'm afraid. And why wouldn't she? I mean, who could compare to him? He's just so...good. Do you know what I learned, losing that duel? I learned that I'll never win. Not that way. That's their game, their rules. I'm not going to fight them. I'm going to fuck them. That's what I know. That's what I am. And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want."
2168,ros,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,And what do you want?
2169,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is. Now wash yourselves. Both of you are working tonight. Hmm."
2170,theon greyjoy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that? Where I come from, we don't show mercy to criminals. Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord, at low tide we'd lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes. The sea would come in closer and closer. You'd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time."
2171,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Where is it you come from?
2172,theon greyjoy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,The Iron Islands.
2173,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,They far away?
2174,theon greyjoy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,You've never heard of the Iron Islands?
2175,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither."
2176,theon greyjoy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Trust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore. In civilized lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles."
2177,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,And what's that?
2178,theon greyjoy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Lord.
2179,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Why?
2180,theon greyjoy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands."
2181,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?"
2182,theon greyjoy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I will be lord after my father.
2183,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,So you're not lord now?
2184,theon greyjoy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"No, you...You having a go at me? Is that it?"
2185,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.
2186,theon greyjoy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I'm not a Southerner.
2187,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,You're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.
2188,theon greyjoy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?"
2189,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Couldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what ""impunent"" means."
2190,theon greyjoy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.
2191,luwin,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.
2192,theon greyjoy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I thought she was our prisoner.
2193,luwin,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
2194,luwin,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
2195,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I'm used to worse than him.
2196,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
2197,luwin,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Why did you come here?
2198,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this. As far South as South goes, before the long night comes."
2199,luwin,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Why? What are you afraid of?
2200,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
2201,luwin,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Owls and Shadowcats and...
2202,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.
2203,luwin,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"The ""things"" you speak of-- they've been gone for thousands of years."
2204,osha,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"They wasn't gone, old man. They was sleeping. And they ain't sleeping no more."
2205,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"I miss girls. Not even talking to them. I never talked to them. Just looking at them, hearing them giggle. Don't you miss girls? Riders. The horn. We have to blow the horn."
2206,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Why is he alone?
2207,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three for..."
2208,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,There's no rider.
2210,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,That's my Uncle Benjen's horse. Where's my Uncle?
2211,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Ned! It's Robert.
2212,robert baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man. I was never meant to be a father. Go on. You don't want to see this."
2213,robert baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust. It stinks. It stinks like death. Don't think I can't smell it. I paid the bastard back, Ned. I drove my knife right through his brain. You ask them if I didn't. Ask them!"
2214,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Robert, my sweet..."
2215,robert baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Out, all of you!"
2216,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,You damned fool.
2217,robert baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say. ""In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of..."" you know how it goes. Fill in the damn titles. ""I hereby command Eddard of House Stark"" titles, titles. ""To serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm upon my death. To rule in my stead, until my son Joffrey comes of age"". Give it over."
2218,robert baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Give it to the council after I'm dead. At least they'll say I did this right, this one thing. You'll rule now. You'll hate it worse than I did, but you'll do it well. The girl, Daenerys. You were right. Varys, Littlefinger, my brother. Worthless. No one to tell me ""no"" but you. Only you. Let her live. Stop it, if it's not too late."
2219,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I will.
2220,robert baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"And my son Help him, Ned. Make him better than me."
2221,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"I'll, I'll do everything I can to honor your memory."
2222,robert baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"My memory. King Robert Baratheon, murdered by a pig. Give me something for the pain and let me die."
2223,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Give him milk of the poppy.
2224,barristan selmy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"He was reeling from the wine. He commanded us to step aside, but I failed him."
2225,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,No man could have protected him from himself.
2226,varys,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?"
2227,barristan selmy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"His squire, from the king's own skin."
2228,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,His squire? The Lannister boy?
2229,varys,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment. I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself.
2230,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen. Whatever arrangements you made, unmake them. At once."
2231,varys,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I'm afraid those birds have flown. The girl is likely dead already.
2232,khal drogo,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"The stallion who mounts the world, has no need for iron chairs."
2233,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world."
2234,khal drogo,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,The earth ends at the black salt sea. No horse can cross the poison water.
2235,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea. The dirt where I was born."
2236,khal drogo,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Not dirt. Lands.
2237,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Lands, yes... There are thousands of ships in the free cities. Wooden horses that fly across the sea."
2238,khal drogo,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
2239,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,It's not a chair. It's a... Throne
2240,khal drogo,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Throne?
2241,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen."
2242,khal drogo,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,A King does not need a chair to sit upon. He only needs a horse.
2243,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Can't you help me make him understand?
2244,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. Have patience, Khaleesi. We will go home, I promise you."
2245,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms. Have I said something funny, Ser?"
2246,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right."
2247,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,And because he had dragons.
2248,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier."
2249,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,You don't believe it.
2250,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report. As for the rest It was 300 years ago. Who knows what really happened? Now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek out the merchant Captain, see if he has any letters for me."
2251,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Well, I'll come with you."
2252,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"No no, don't trouble yourself. Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough."
2254,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Sweet reds! I have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor! Tyrosh pear brandy! Andalish sours! I have them! I have them!"
2255,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"A taste for the Khaleesi? I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady. One taste and you'll name your first child after me."
2256,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine. Just a taste."
2257,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"My Lady, you are from Westeros."
2258,doreah,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen. Khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.
2259,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Princess.
2260,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.
2261,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,That? Dornish swill. Not worthy of a princess. I have a dry red from the Arbor. Nectar of the Gods. Let me give you a cask. Uh... a gift.
2262,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"You honor me, Ser."
2263,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,The honor...the honor is all mine.
2264,rakharo,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Huh-uh, huh-uh."
2265,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess."
2266,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I hope to repay your kindness someday.
2267,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Rakharo.
2268,rakharo,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Huh.
2269,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Put down that cask.
2270,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Is something wrong?
2271,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I have a thirst. Open it.
2272,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.
2273,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Open it.
2274,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Pour.
2275,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.
2276,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Do as he says.
2277,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,As the princess commands.
2278,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord. Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue."
2279,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,You first.
2280,wine merchant,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
2281,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,You will drink.
2282,doreah,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Khaleesi! Stop him!
2283,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Come.
2284,jeor mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"You came to us as outlaws, poachers, rapers, killers, thieves. You came alone, in chains, without friends nor honor. You came to us rich and you came to us poor. Some of you bear the names of proud houses, others only bastard names or no names at all. It does not matter. All that, is in the past. Here, on the wall, are all one house. Tonight..."
2285,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,You're allowed to look happy. You're going to be a Ranger.
2286,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I want to find my Uncle. I know he's alive out there. I know he is.
2287,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"I wish I could help you, but I'm no Ranger. It's the steward's life for me."
2288,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"There's honor in being a steward. Not much, really. But there's food."
2289,jeor mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Here you begin anew. A man of The Night's Watch lives his life for the realm. Not for a king, or a lord, or the honor of this house or that house. Not for gold nor glory nor a woman's love. But for the realm! And all the people in it. You've all learned the words of the vow. Think carefully before you say them. The penalty for desertion, is death. You can take your vows here tonight, at sunset. Do any of you still keep the old Gods?"
2290,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"I do, my lord."
2291,jeor mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.
2292,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Yes, my lord."
2293,jeor mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall. And your old Gods too, maybe."
2294,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"my lord, might I go as well?"
2295,jeor mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?
2296,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"No, my lord. I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him."
2297,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,The Night's Watch is my house now.
2298,jeor mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"As you wish, lad. You've all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths. Halder to the builders. Pyp to the stewards. Toad to the builders. Grenn to the Rangers. Samwell to the stewards. Matthar to the Rangers. Dareon to the stewards. Balian to the Rangers. Rast to the Rangers. Jon to the stewards. Rancer to the builders. Echiel to the builders. Gordo to the stewards. Niko to the Rangers. Escan to the Rangers. Vorkoy to the builders. Joby to the stables. Mink to the kitchens. Allo to the builders. Nelugo to the Rangers. May all the Gods preserve you."
2299,jaremy rykker,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Rangers with me.
2300,othell yarwyck,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Builders!
2301,aemon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library. Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens. Luke, report to one-eyed Joe in the stables. Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch. Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive. Make no comment about his nose. Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward."
2302,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.
2303,aemon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers. Change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.
2304,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Do you take me for a servant?
2305,aemon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,We took you for a man of The Night's Watch. But perhaps we were wrong in that.
2306,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,May I go?
2307,aemon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,As you wish.
2308,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?"
2309,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all. He wanted it and he got it."
2310,pypar,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock. I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver. So now I'm here. At the end of the world with no one to sing for, but old men and little shits like you. I'll never see my family again. I'll never be inside a woman again."
2311,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
2312,pypar,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
2313,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song."
2314,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch. You'll be with him day and night. Yes, you'll clean his clothes. But you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle. You'll know everything, be part of everything. And he asked for you himself. He wants to groom you for command."
2315,jon snow,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger."
2316,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"I always wanted to be a Wizard. What? No, I'm serious."
2317,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Lord Stark, a moment. Alone if you will."
2318,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,He named you Protector of the Realm
2319,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Stark
2320,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,She won't care. Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.
2321,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,And what should I do with a hundred swords?
2322,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps. We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody. Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the King holds the Kingdom. Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare. By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us."
2323,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,What about Stannis?
2324,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis? You have odd notions about protecting the realm.
2325,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Stannis is your older brother.
2326,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,This isn't about the bloody line of succession. That didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now. What's best for the Kingdoms? What's best for the people we rule? We all know what Stannis is. He inspires no love or loyalty. He's not a King. I am.
2327,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice. He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.
2328,renly baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert. Tell me something"
2329,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
2330,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"You will sail to dragonstone tonight. You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon. Not his steward, not his Captain of the guard, and not his wife. Only Stannis himself."
2331,tomard,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Yes, My Lord."
2332,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Now leave us.
2333,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,My Lord protector.
2334,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,The King has no true born sons. Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister's bastards.
2335,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,So when the King dies...
2336,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.
2337,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,So it would seem. Unless...
2338,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"There is no ""unless"". He is the rightful heir. Nothing can change that."
2339,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,And he cannot take the throne without your help. You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.
2340,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Do you have a shred of honor?
2341,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm. All of the power is yours. You need only reach out and take it. Make peace with the Lannisters. Release the Imp. Wed your daughter to Joffrey. We have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis. And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead."
2342,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,We?
2343,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest."
2344,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,What you suggest is treason.
2345,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Only if we lose.
2346,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy."
2347,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"We only make peace with our enemies, my Lord."
2348,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,No. I won't do it.
2349,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,So it will be Stannis and war?
2350,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,There is no other choice. He is the heir.
2351,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly."
2352,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"You promised Catelyn you would help me. The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms. Enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard. I need the gold cloaks. The City Watch is 2,000 strong and sworn to defend the King's peace."
2353,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Look at you. You know what you want me to do.
2355,othell yarwyck,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,You knelt as boys. Rise now as men of The Night's Watch.
2357,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,What's he got there?
2358,samwell tarly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Gods be good!
2359,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,What will they do to him?
2360,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"When the Khalasar rides, he'll be leashed to a saddle, forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can."
2361,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,And when he falls?
2362,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I saw a man last nine miles once.
2363,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,King Robert still wants me dead.
2364,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,This poisoner was the first. He won't be the last.
2365,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone."
2366,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"He will never leave you alone. If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you. If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies would tell him. He will never abandon the hunt. You're a Targaryen. The last Targaryen. Your son will have Targaryen blood with 40,000 riders behind him."
2367,daenerys targaryen,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,He will not have my son.
2368,jorah mormont,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"He will not have you either, Khaleesi."
2369,khal drogo,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Moon of my life. Are you hurt?
2370,khal drogo,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did. Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.I make this gift to you. And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world. I will also pledge a gift.I will give him the iron chair, that his mother's father sat upon. I will give him Seven Kingdoms. I Drogo, will do this. I will take my Khalasar west to where the world ends and ride wooden horses across the black salt water as no Khal has done before. I will kill the men in iron suits and tear down their stone houses. I will rape their women, take their children as slaves and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak. This, I vow. I, Drogo, son of Bharbo. I swear before the Mother of Mountains as the stars look down in witness! As the stars look down in witness! The Khalasar is moving out of Vaes Dothrak, riding underneath the Horse Gate. Just as Jorah predicted, the wine merchant is leashed to one of the horses saddles, covered with dirt, struggling to move on."
2372,varly,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Stop!
2373,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"No, all right."
2375,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,King Joffrey?
2377,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,All is accomplished. The City Watch is yours.
2378,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Good. Is Lord Renly joining us?
2379,varys,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I fear Lord Renly has left the city. He rode through the old gate an hour before dawn with Ser Loras Tyrell and some 50 retainers.
2380,janos slynt,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"We stand behind you, Lord Stark."
2382,joffrey baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation. I wish to be crowned within the fortnight. Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councilors.
2383,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Ser Barristan, I believe no man here could ever question your honor."
2384,barristan selmy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"King Robert's seal. Unbroken. ""Lord Eddard Stark is herein named Protector of the Realm, to rule as Regent until the heir come of age""."
2385,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"May I see that letter, Ser Barristan? Protector of the realm. Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark? A piece of paper? Cersei shreds Robert's letter to pieces"
2386,barristan selmy,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Those were the King's words.
2387,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"We have a new King now. Lord Eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel. Allow me to return the courtesy. Bend the knee, My Lord. Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son and we shall allow you to live out your days in the gray waste you call home. Your son has no claim to the throne."
2388,joffrey baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Liar!
2389,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark."
2390,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm."
2391,cersei lannister,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,You think he stands alone?
2392,joffrey baratheon,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!"
2393,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,"Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody. Escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard."
2394,janos slynt,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Men of the Watch!
2395,eddard stark,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I want no bloodshed. Tell your men to lay down their swords. No one needs to die.
2396,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,Now!
2397,petyr baelish,1,7,you win or you die,Unnamed Scene_11,I did warn you not to trust me.
2398,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Yah! Left high, left low."
2399,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Right low, lunge right."

2401,mordane,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
2402,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.
2403,mordane,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Hush! Go back to your room.
2404,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,What is it? What's happening?
2405,mordane,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Do as I told you. Run!
2406,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"This way! Left, right."
2407,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"You said right, but you went left."
2408,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,And now you are a dead girl.
2409,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Only 'cause you lied.
2410,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,My tongue lied.
2411,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"I was so. I watched, but you..."
2412,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Watching is not seeing, dead girl."
2413,meryn trant,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Arya Stark, come with us."
2414,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? I am wondering.
2415,meryn trant,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Mind your place, dancing master."
2416,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,My father wouldn't send you.
2417,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
2418,meryn trant,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Take her.
2419,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?"
2421,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I am Syrio Forel.
2423,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
2424,meryn trant,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.
2425,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day."
2426,meryn trant,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Bloody oafs.
2427,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Be gone now, Arya."
2428,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Come with me. Run.
2429,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The first sword of Braavos does not run.
2430,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,What do we say to the God of death?
2431,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Not today.
2432,syrio forel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Go.
2433,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Not today. Not today.
2434,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Stay away from me.
2435,sandor clegane,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Who do you think sent me?
2436,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Needle.
2437,stable boy,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,There she is.
2438,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,What do you want?
2439,stable boy,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"I want you, wolf girl. Come here."
2440,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
2441,stable boy,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"She'll reward me, the Queen!"
2442,arya stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Stay away!
2443,varys,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Lord Stark, you must be thirsty."
2444,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Varys.
2445,varys,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"I promise you it isn't poisoned. Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch? Not so much, My Lord. I would save the rest, if I were you. Hide it. Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells."
2446,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,What about my daughters?
2447,varys,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
2448,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,And Sansa?
2449,varys,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Still engaged to Joffrey.
2450,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
2451,varys,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"And would again, My Lord. I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords. When you look at me do you see a hero? What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?"
2452,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The madness of mercy. That she might save her children.
2453,varys,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Ah, the children. It is always the innocents who suffer. It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar. The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King. I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?"
2454,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The Queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother.
2455,varys,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The wrong brother sadly. And lost to her. Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
2456,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it."
2457,varys,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Not today, My Lord."
2458,eddard stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Tell me something, Varys."
2459,varys,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"The Realm, My Lord. Someone must."
2460,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"It's Othor, without a doubt."
2461,othell yarwyck,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off."
2462,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
2463,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say."
2464,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Mmm.
2465,samwell tarly,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The smell.
2466,othell yarwyck,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,What smell?
2467,samwell tarly,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"There is none.If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?"
2468,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,We should burn them.
2469,othell yarwyck,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Snow's not wrong, My Lord. Fire will do for them. The Wildling way."
2470,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"I want Maester Aemon to examine them first. You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid. Get them inside."
2471,othell yarwyck,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,You heard him.
2472,alliser thorne,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers. A raven from King's Landing."
2474,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself. The King is dead."
2475,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Is there any word of my father?
2476,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Sit. Lord Stark has been charged with treason. They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
2477,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid. Your duty lies here now.
2478,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,My sisters were in King's Landing too.
2479,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
2480,varys,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear."
2481,pycelle,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
2482,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"He wouldn't do that. He knows how much I love Joffrey. He wouldn't. Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake. Send for my father. He'll tell you, the King was his friend."
2483,cersei lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong. We know that. Yet you are the daughter of a traitor. How can I allow you to marry my son?"
2484,pycelle,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King. She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?"
2485,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see. I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise. I won't hatch anything."
2486,petyr baelish,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"The girl is innocent, Your Grace. She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty."
2487,cersei lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest. What's his name?"
2488,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Robb.
2489,cersei lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt. Best it comes from you. If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace. Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey."
2490,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"If...if I could see my father, talk to him about..."
2491,cersei lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"You disappoint me, child. We have told you of your father's treason. Why would you want to speak to a traitor?"
2492,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I only meant that...what will happen to him?
2493,cersei lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,That depends.
2494,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,On...on what?
2495,cersei lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,On your brother. And on you.
2496,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Treason? Sansa wrote this?
2497,luwin,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words. You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King."
2498,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?"
2499,luwin,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"This is a royal command, My Lord. If you should refuse to obey..."
2500,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"I won't refuse. His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing. But not alone. Call the banners."
2501,luwin,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"All of them, My Lord?"
2502,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?"
2503,luwin,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,They have.
2505,luwin,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Yeah.
2506,theon greyjoy,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Are you afraid?
2507,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I must be.
2508,theon greyjoy,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Good.
2509,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Why is that good?
2510,theon greyjoy,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,It means you're not stupid.
2511,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,You've had this since dawn?
2512,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"He sent it to me, not you. I've only shown it to you as a courtesy."
2513,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,A courtesy?! My husband has been taken prisoner. My son intends to declare war.
2514,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,A war? Your son against the Lannisters? You should go to him. Teach him patience.
2515,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience? He is your brother by law! Does family mean nothing to you?
2516,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Family means everything to me.
2517,robin arryn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I'm hungry.
2518,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Hush now, darling. You just ate."
2519,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?
2520,robin arryn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,But I'm hungry!
2521,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Soon, love, soon. You're always welcome here, sister. But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight..."
2522,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,That is what I ask.
2523,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Go on, sweet. Time for your bath. I'll feed you after."
2524,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,If you fear for the safety of your son...
2525,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Of course I fear for the safety of my son! Are you an idiot? They killed my husband. You say they shoved your boy from a window. These people will do anything.
2526,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,And that is why we have to stop them.
2527,lysa arryn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord."
2528,bronn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Will you shut up? There's hill tribes all around here.
2529,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart."
2530,bronn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I should just take your food and leave you here.
2531,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Starve, most likely."
2532,bronn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"You don't think I'd do it, do you?"
2533,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women? Golden women? Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer. But you knew that. That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor."
2534,bronn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Fair enough. But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and ""My Lord"" you every time you take a shit. I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend."
2535,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Though I would treasure your friendship. I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder. And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out. Remember this
2536,bronn,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion.
2537,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Come, share our fire. Help yourselves to our goat."
2538,shagga,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"When you meet your Gods, you tell them Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you."
2539,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
2540,shagga,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?"
2541,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock."
2542,shagga,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Take the half man. He can dance for the children. Kill the other one.
2543,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"No no no no no! My, my House is rich and powerful. If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold."
2544,shagga,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,We have no use for a half man's promises.
2545,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies. What do the Stone Crows do? Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by? Are those the best weapons you could steal? Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back. Lannister smiths shit better steel."
2546,shagga,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
2547,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns. But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf, I will not give you trinkets. I will give you this."
2548,shagga,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"What is ""this""?"
2549,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The Vale of Arryn. The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes. The Lords of the Vale want me dead. I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.
2550,alliser thorne,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Now there's a rare sight. Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard."
2551,samwell tarly,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Jon, no! Jon, stop, put it down!"
2552,alliser thorne,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Blood will always tell. You'll hang for this, bastard."
2553,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I told you not to do anything stupid. You're confined to quarters. Go.
2554,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Ghost, what's wrong? Is something out there?"
2555,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Commander?
2556,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Stay.
2557,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Hello? Who's there? Lord Commander?
2558,jeor mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Snow!?
2559,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Commander! Othor gets back on his feet, pulling out Jon's sword out of his chest."
2560,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Move move!
2561,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,What did they do?
2562,rakharo,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Lamb men make good slaves. Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers. And the slavers will give us gold...and silk and steel.
2563,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
2564,jorah mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Gold to hire ships, Princess. Ships to sail to Westeros. While walking a little further, Dany sees Dothraki men looting and holding Lhazareen captive."
2565,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Jorah, make them stop."
2566,jorah mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Khaleesi?
2567,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,You heard me.
2568,jorah mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,These men have shed blood for their Khal. Now they claim their rewards.
2569,rakharo,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi. The riders do her honor. If her wailing offends the Khaleesi, I will bring you her tongue."
2570,jorah mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been."
2571,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"I do not have a gentle heart, Ser. Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why."
2572,rakharo,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Kash qoy qoyi thira disse. Me qorasokh anni! While Rhakharo argues with a Dothraki man, Jorah brings over a Lhazareen woman."
2573,jorah mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Come.
2575,jorah mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,What do you want done with them?
2576,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Bring her to me. And those women there.
2577,jorah mormont,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"You cannot claim them all, Princess."
2578,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"I can, and I will."
2579,mago,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Me Fati! Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni, ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!"
2580,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Me vastoe hatif anni; ahhazaan yer Nemo vacchaki.
2581,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Moon of my life. Mago says you have taken his spoils. A daughter of a lamb men, who was his to mount. Tell me the truth of this."
2582,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars. I have claimed many daughters this day, so they cannot be mounted."
2583,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,This is the way of war. These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
2584,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"It pleases me to keep them safe. If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wifes."
2585,qotho,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Does the horse mate with the lamb?
2586,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The dragons feeds on horse and lamb alike.
2587,mago,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,You are a foreigner. You do not command me.
2588,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I am Khaleesi. I do command you.
2589,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"See how fierce she grows? That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world. Filling her with his fire. I will hear no more. Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock."
2590,mago,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
2591,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Ohosa. Os. I will not have your body burned. I will not give you that honor.
2592,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The beetles will feed on your eyes. The worms will crawl through your lungs.
2593,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The rain will fall on your rotting skin...
2594,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Until nothing is left of you but bones!
2595,mago,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,First you have to kill me!
2596,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,My sun and stars is wounded.
2597,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"A scratch, moon of my life."
2598,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Where are the healers?
2599,khal drogo,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,This is the bite of a fly.
2600,mirri maz duur,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I can help the great rider with his cut.
2601,qotho,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
2602,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,She is mine let her speak.
2603,mirri maz duur,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Thank you, silver lady."
2604,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Who are you?
2605,mirri maz duur,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I am named Mirri Maz Duur. I was the Godswife of this Temple.
2606,qotho,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,A witch. And spits on the ground.
2607,mirri maz duur,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"My mother was Godswife here before me. She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments. All men are of one flock, so my people believe. The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his..."
2608,qotho,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Too many words. A witch's words poison the ears.
2609,mirri maz duur,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester."
2610,daenerys targaryen,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars. It makes me hurt to see you bleed."
2611,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy. I'm the man you want leading the Vanguard."
2612,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Galbart Glover will lead the Van.
2613,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover. I will lead the Van or I will take my men and march them home.
2614,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber. And when I am done with the Lannisters, I will march back North, root you out of your Keep and hang you for an oathbreaker."
2615,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Oathbreaker, is it?!"
2616,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
2617,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord. But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
2618,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Your meat...is bloody tough.
2619,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,What is it? What's happened?
2620,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Shh, it's all right."
2621,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Where are you going?
2622,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,South. For father.
2623,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,But it's the middle of the night.
2624,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The Lannisters have spies everywhere. I don't want them to know we're coming.
2625,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,They have more men than we do.
2626,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Aye, they do."
2627,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Can't I come with you? I can ride now. You've seen me riding. And I won't get in the way, I..."
2628,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,There must always be a Stark at Winterfell. Until I return that will be you. You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone. Do you understand? Listen to Maester Luwin. Look after your little brother.
2629,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I will.
2630,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared. Until I return."
2631,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"How long have you been hiding out there? Robb will be looking for you, to say goodbye."
2632,rickon stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,They've all gone away.
2633,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,They'll be back soon.
2634,rickon stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"No, they won't."
2635,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Please watch over Robb. And watch over all the other men from Winterfell. And Theon too, I suppose."
2636,osha,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"You hear them, boy? The Old Gods are answering you."
2637,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,What are you doing here?
2638,osha,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"They're my Gods too. Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods. Even slaves are allowed to pray."
2639,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,You're not a slave.
2640,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat."
2641,osha,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"I'm not complaining, Little Lord, just telling truths."
2642,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
2643,osha,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"You asked them, they're answering you. Shh. Open your ears."
2644,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,It's only the wind.
2645,osha,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods? They see you, boy. They hear you. Your brother will get no help from them where he's going. The Old Gods have no power in the South. The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago. How can they watch when they have no eyes?"
2646,osha,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Well, there's a big man. He has giants blood in him or I'm the Queen."
2647,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Go back and find your clothes, Hodor. Go dress."
2648,hodor,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Hodor.
2649,bran stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
2650,osha,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Giants and worse than giants. I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way. All these swords, they should be going North, boy. North, not south! The cold winds are rising."
2651,samwell tarly,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,They were touched by White Walkers. That's why they came back. That's why their eyes turned blue. Only fire will stop them.
2652,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,How do you know that?
2653,samwell tarly,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I read about it in a book. A very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
2654,jon snow,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,What else did the book say?
2655,samwell tarly,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years. And when they wake up...
2656,pypar,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"And when they wake up, what?"
2657,samwell tarly,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I hope The Wall is high enough.
2658,rodrik cassel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Summer snows, My Lady."
2659,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Robb's brought the North with him.
2660,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels. And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South. Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
2661,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts ten times this large."
2662,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Mother!
2663,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,You look well.
2664,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times."
2665,theon greyjoy,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady."
2666,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"I had not thought to be here. I would speak with my son alone. I know you will forgive me, My Lords."
2667,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"You heard her! Move your asses! Come on, out. You too, Greyjoy. Are you bloody deaf? Have no fear, My Lady. We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned. You old devil, Rodrik."
2668,rodrik cassel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Jon.
2669,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"You're not wasting away, are you? As soon as the men left, Catelyn hugs Robb."
2670,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.And now I find you leading a host to war.
2671,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,There was no one else.
2672,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,No one? Who were those men I saw here?
2673,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,None of them are Starks.
2674,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,All of them are seasoned in battle.
2675,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
2676,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Oh, would that I could."
2677,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,There was a letter. From Sansa.
2678,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"From the Queen, you mean. There's no mention of Arya."
2679,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,No.
2680,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,How many men do you have?
2681,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"18,000. If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey..."
2682,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"you would never be allowed to leave. No. Our best hope, our only hope, is that you can defeat them in the field."
2683,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,And if I lose?
2684,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children, when the Mad King fell?"
2685,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,They were butchered in their sleep.
2686,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"On the orders of Tywin Lannister. And the years have not made him kinder. If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die."
2687,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Well, that makes it simple then."

2689,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
2690,shagga,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Best for Tyrion son of Tywin. Not best for me.

2699,tywin lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake. Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
2700,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"We have our differences, Jaime and I. He's braver. I'm better looking."

2704,tywin lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Is our hostage. He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.

2710,tyrion lannister,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence. You'd like him. While we're on the subject of war, I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts. We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces..."

2716,rodrik cassel,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north. We need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage."
2717,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun. Do that and the River Lords will join us."
2718,robb stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
2719,theon greyjoy,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Lord Frey controls that bridge. Your father's bannerman.
2720,catelyn stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"""The late Lord Frey"" my father calls him. At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done. Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others. Meanwhile, outside a few Stark men captured a scout, leading him to Robbs tent."
2721,theon greyjoy,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Robb's right. We need that bridge.
2722,greatjon umber,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,So what's it gonna be? Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?

2768,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,"No, My Lords. I know he must be punished. All I ask is mercy. I know My Lord father must regret what he did. He was King Robert's friend and he loved him. You all know he loved him. He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him. They must have lied to him. Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody. They must have lied!"
2769,joffrey baratheon,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,He said I wasn't the King. Why did he say that?
2770,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,He was badly hurt. Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy. He wasn't himself. Otherwise he never would have said it.

2775,joffrey baratheon,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,Your sweet words have moved me. But your father has to confess. He has to confess and say that I'm the King or there'll be no mercy for him.
2776,sansa stark,1,8,the pointy end,Unnamed Scene_12,He will.1Embed
2777,eddard stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Another visit? lt seems you're my last friend.
2778,varys,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"No, no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life."
2779,eddard stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,On her knees begging for me. Hm! Did you laugh with the others?
2780,varys,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want."
2781,eddard stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l don't know what you want. l've given up trying to guess.
2782,varys,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"When l was still a boy - before they cut my balls off with a hot knife - l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. l am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. l'm a good actor, my lord."
2783,eddard stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Huh. Can you free me from this pit?
2784,varys,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero."
2785,eddard stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?"
2786,varys,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.
2787,eddard stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Robb? He's just a boy.
2788,varys,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
2789,eddard stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.
2790,varys,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
2791,eddard stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?"
2792,varys,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son."
2793,eddard stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.
2794,varys,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?"
2795,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
2796,theon greyjoy,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
2797,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
2798,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
2799,greatjon umber,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
2800,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
2801,theon greyjoy,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
2802,greatjon umber,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
2803,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll."
2804,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Have my horse saddled and ready.
2805,greatjon umber,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
2806,theon greyjoy,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
2807,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me."
2808,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l agree. l'll go.
2810,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.
2811,greatjon umber,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Unless there was a profit in it.
2812,walder frey,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,What do you want?
2813,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord."
2814,walder frey,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?"
2815,stevron frey,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is"
2816,walder frey,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?"
2817,ryger rivers,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Father, please"
2818,walder frey,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly. All right, you come forward. (kisses her hand) There. Now that l've observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths."
2819,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,ls there somewhere we can talk?
2820,walder frey,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you! (taps his new wife on the bottom) Oh! You too. (To Catelyn) You see that? Fifteen, she is. A little flower. And her honey's all mine."
2821,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l'm sure she will give you many sons.
2822,walder frey,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
2823,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"He is quite ill, my lord."
2824,walder frey,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me."
2825,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"My lord, l"
2826,walder frey,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
2827,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l'm sure there were reasons
2828,walder frey,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
2829,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way."
2830,walder frey,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Why should l let him?
2831,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls."
2832,walder frey,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm."
2833,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,You swore an oath to my father.
2834,walder frey,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters."
2835,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Why don't you?
2836,walder frey,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?"
2838,jeor mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
2839,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Soon, he says."
2840,jeor mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think."
2841,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,This is Valyrian steel.
2842,jeor mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros."
2843,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"My lord, you honor me, but l can't"
2844,jeor mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?"
2845,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Yes, my lord."
2846,jeor mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it."
2847,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
2848,jeor mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist   l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper."
2849,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Yes, my lord."
2853,pypar,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Go on, let's have a look."
2854,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,At what?
2855,grenn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,The sword! Show us the sword.
2857,pypar,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Let's have a look.
2858,grenn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Piss off.
2859,pypar,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!"
2860,grenn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Look at its eyes.
2861,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,What is it?
2862,samwell tarly,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l - l can't.
2863,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,You can't what?
2864,samwell tarly,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l'm really not supposed to say.
2865,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,And yet you really want to say. You want to say that
2866,samwell tarly,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
2867,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,What? What about him?
2868,samwell tarly,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe."
2869,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l should be there. l should be with him.
2870,greatjon umber,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"lf we do that, they'll never get back across."
2871,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Well? What did he say?
2872,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well."
2873,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Huh.
2874,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
2875,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,What does he want in return?
2876,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
2877,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Fine, fine. And?"
2878,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
2879,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,She won't be happy about that. And?
2880,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.
2881,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
2882,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l did.
2883,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,And?
2884,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,One was   Do you consent?
2885,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Can l refuse?
2886,catelyn stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Not if you want to cross.
2887,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Then l consent.
2888,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Sam said you wanted to see me?
2889,aemon,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?"
2890,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,No.
2891,aemon,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?"
2892,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"He would do whatever was right, no matter what."
2893,aemon,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?"
2894,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Sam told you.
2895,aemon,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose."
2896,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
2897,aemon,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know."
2898,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother."
2899,aemon,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South
2900,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Who are you?
2901,aemon,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King."
2902,jon snow,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,You're Aemon Targaryen.
2903,aemon,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have."
2904,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) My lord  My sun and stars  Drogo.
2905,khal drogo,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) My horse
2906,cohollo,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) Blood of my blood
2907,khal drogo,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"(in Dothraki) No, l must ride."
2908,qotho,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
2909,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"(in Dothraki) He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here."
2910,qotho,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
2911,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
2912,qotho,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"(in Dothraki) You do not command me, Khaleesi."
2913,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
2914,qotho,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"(in Dothraki) The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi."
2915,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
2916,qotho,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) Hyah! Hyah!
2917,kevan lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
2918,tywin lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage."
2919,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt."
2920,tywin lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them."
2921,kevan lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided."
2922,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Shagga likes axes.
2923,tywin lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard."
2924,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
2925,kevan lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,They do seem rather ferocious.
2926,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."
2927,tywin lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander."
2928,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
2929,tywin lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
2930,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords."
2931,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
2932,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l took her.
2933,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Took her? From whom?
2934,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down."
2935,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,And he didn't have anything to say about it?
2936,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,He said something.
2937,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow."
2938,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one."
2939,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Who are you?
2941,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,What did your mother call you?
2943,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,My mother died giving birth to me.
2944,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
2945,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,What sort of accent is that?
2946,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Foreign.
2947,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,For-
2948,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,What do you want from me?
2949,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."
2950,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,And what do l get?
2951,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular."
2952,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Who told you this? Women you paid?
2953,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
2954,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Let's start with your last night in this world.
2955,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Khaleesi.
2956,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
2957,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"He will die tonight, Khaleesi."
2958,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,He can't. He can't. l won't let him.
2959,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
2960,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l won't leave him.
2961,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"He's already gone, Khaleesi."
2962,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo."
2963,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs."
2964,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l won't leave him.
2965,mirri maz duur,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,The wound has festered.
2966,qotho,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"(in Dothraki) You did this, witch. (pulls a dagger out of its sheath)"
2967,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) Stop it! l don't want her hurt.
2968,qotho,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"(in Dothraki) No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal."
2969,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
2970,qotho,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"(in Dothraki) Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing."
2971,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.
2972,qotho,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"(in Dothraki) The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi."
2973,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser."
2974,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l think you're right.
2975,mirri maz duur,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,You've saved me once more.
2976,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,And now you must save him.
2977,mirri maz duur,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.
2978,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some   some magic.
2979,mirri maz duur,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
2980,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Do it. Save him.
2981,mirri maz duur,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,There is a price.
2982,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"You'll have gold, whatever you want."
2983,mirri maz duur,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.
2984,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,My death?
2985,mirri maz duur,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse."
2986,rakharo,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch."
2987,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Kill her and you kill your khal.
2988,rakharo,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.
2989,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.
2990,mirri maz duur,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Go. Now.
2991,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Take her and leave. Take her!
2992,mirri maz duur,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight."
2993,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,No one will enter.
2994,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Bring him back to me. Daenerys leaves the tent as the horse collapses to the ground, dead. Jorah comes to her. What have you done?"
2995,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l have to save him.
2996,qotho,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) This must not be.
2997,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) This must be.
2998,qotho,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) Witch.
2999,rakharo,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,(in Dothraki) Nothing good will come of this.
3000,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"(in Dothraki) No, you can't."
3001,irri,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Khaleesi!
3002,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"(in Dothraki) No further, horselord."
3003,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Are you hurt?
3004,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,The baby
3005,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Hmm?
3006,daenerys targaryen,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,is coming.
3007,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Fetch the midwives.
3008,rakharo,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,They will not come. They say she is cursed.
3009,jorah mormont,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,They'll come or l'll have their heads.
3010,rakharo,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.
3011,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Are you in agony, my lion?"
3012,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,No.
3013,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
3014,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?"
3015,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Just used to it.
3016,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Drink.
3017,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Let's play a new game.
3018,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
3019,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
3020,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Not if you win.
3021,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."
3022,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,What are you good at?
3023,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l happen to be a great judge of character.
3024,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,This sounds like a boring game.
3025,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying."
3026,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l don't want to play this game.
3027,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
3028,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,But my mother hit harder.
3029,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,You killed your first man before you were 12.
3030,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"lt was a woman. (Tyrion drinks. Shae looks at Bronn, surprised.) She swung an axe at me."
3031,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,You've been north of the Wall.
3032,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,What brought you up there?
3033,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Work.
3034,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. (Tyrion drinks) Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."
3035,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l don't want to play.
3036,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
3037,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Drink.
3038,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
3039,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Drink.
3040,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,And we've established the rules about lying?
3041,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Drink!
3042,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
3043,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
3044,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"So, specifics  You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
3045,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Drink.
3046,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Are you sure
3047,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head."
3048,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize."
3049,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,My turn.
3050,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
3051,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Who were you in love with?
3052,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,That's not how the game works.
3053,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l don't care the way the game works.
3054,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Our lord here used to be married.
3055,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Married?
3056,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,How did you hear that?
3057,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
3058,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Another night, perhaps."
3059,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Not another night. This night.
3060,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,lt's not a pleasant story.
3061,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Oh, maybe l will cry."
3062,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
3063,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
3064,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"For three chickens, l should hope so."
3065,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
3066,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."
3067,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
3068,bronn,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,l would have killed the man who did that to me.
3069,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,You should have known she was a whore.
3070,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."
3071,shae,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
3072,tyrion lannister,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"As l said, l was young and stupid."

3123,robb stark,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,Aye. But the dead won't hear them. (making a speech to his bannermen) One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.

Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say"
3138,pycelle,1,9,baelor,Unnamed Scene_14,"As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?"

3272,jorah mormont,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,They say the child was
3273,mirri maz duur,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,"(entering the tent) Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price."
3274,daenerys targaryen,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.
3275,mirri maz duur,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,"As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him."

3277,daenerys targaryen,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,l want to see him now.
3278,daenerys targaryen,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,The khalasar is gone.
3279,jorah mormont,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,"A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess."

3281,jorah mormont,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,"He seems to like the warmth, Princess."
3282,mirri maz duur,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,"He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life."
3283,daenerys targaryen,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,(looking at Drogo s catatonic expression) This is not life. When will he be as he was?
3284,mirri maz duur,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,"When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves."
3285,daenerys targaryen,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,Leave us.
3286,jorah mormont,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,l don't want you alone with this sorceress.
3287,daenerys targaryen,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.
3288,daenerys targaryen,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,You knew what l was buying and you knew the price.
3289,mirri maz duur,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,lt was wrong of them to burn my temple. lt angered the Great Shepherd.

3293,mirri maz duur,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,"Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my god's house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?"
3294,daenerys targaryen,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,Your life.
3295,mirri maz duur,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,Why don't you take a look at your khal. Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.

3297,jon snow,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,"Get out of my way, Sam."
3298,samwell tarly,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?

3311,tyrion lannister,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,"No, he said l couldn't take you with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point."
3312,shae,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,He knew my name?
3313,tyrion lannister,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,What?
3314,shae,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,"He said, ""Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing""?"
3315,tyrion lannister,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,"l believe he used the word ""whore""."
3316,shae,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out?
3317,shae,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,"I m funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore."
3318,tyrion lannister,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,"My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets.

Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand   (Shae kisses Tyrion)"

3325,samwell tarly,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,Did we get him?
3326,grenn,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,"Come on, help me get him up."
3327,pypar,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,Lucky you've got plenty of padding. (to Jon) We're taking you back to where you belong.

3332,pypar,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,Sam told us everything. We're sorry about your father.
3333,grenn,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.
3334,jon snow,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,l have to.
3335,grenn,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,You can't. You said the words.

The thing you need to understand about kings is   For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal   powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign."

3385,hot pie,1,10,fire and blood,Unnamed Scene_15,l could use me a sword like that.

3446,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,We looked for you on the battlefield. (Joffrey sits down). You were nowhere to be found.
3447,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"I've been here, ruling the kingdoms."
3448,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"What a fine job you've done. (Turns to Myrcella). Look at you. (Kisses her). More beautiful than ever. (Turns to Tommen). And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. (Tyrion smiles. He and Myrcella laugh). This one doesn't like me."
3449,bronn,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,Can't imagine why.
3450,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,We heard you were dead.
3451,myrcella baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,I'm glad you're not dead.
3452,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. (Looks at Sansa). My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss."
3453,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!
3454,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.
3455,sansa stark,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey."
3456,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,Of course you are.
3457,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"Well, (Gulps down his wine), enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done."
3458,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,What work? (Bronn and the tribesmen follow Tyrion. Joffrey stands up). Why are you here?
3459,pycelle,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, (The man sets the cage down and removes the cover), considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last. The longest summer in living memory."
3460,varys,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter."
3461,pycelle,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,A common superstition.
3462,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, (Shrugs indifferently), we'll have fewer peasants."
3463,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, it'll only get worse."
3464,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?"
3465,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"I do, Your Grace."
3466,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,And are you not a Lord at my command?
3467,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace."
3468,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital."
3469,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"Yes, Your Grace."
3470,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. (Kisses Cersei on the cheek). War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on."
3471,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,What are you doing here?
3472,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"(Sits down) It's been a remarkable journey. I, (grabs a glass), pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. (Pours himself wine). I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for."
3473,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,What are you doing here? This is the small council.
3474,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings."
3475,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,Our father is Hand of the King.
3476,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"Yes, but in his absence…"
3477,varys,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -
3478,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,Out! All of you out. (The small council members all get up and leave until it is only Cersei and Tyrion. Cersei stands up and approaches Tyrion). I would like to know how you tricked father into this.
3479,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. (Cersei sits down)."
3480,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,I've done nothing.
3481,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
3482,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,I tried to stop it.
3483,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
3484,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,Robb Stark is a child.
3485,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
3486,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,What do you know about warfare?
3487,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
3488,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,Joffrey is King.
3489,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,Joffrey is King.
3490,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,You are here to advise him.
3491,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back."
3492,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,How?
3493,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
3494,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,One.
3495,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,One?
3496,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"Arya, little animal, she disappeared."
3497,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,Unnamed Scene_16,"Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child."
3500,luwin,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.
3502,bran stark,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.
3504,bran stark,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,"Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?"
3506,luwin,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,"We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?"
3508,luwin,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,"We didn't want him here all day, did we?"
3509,bran stark,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
3510,luwin,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. (Bran sighs). Lord Portan.
3511,portan,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,"(Walks forward). My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons."
3512,osha,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away.
3513,bran stark,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,Don't have any pain.
3514,osha,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,Lucky for you.
3515,bran stark,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,That way.
3516,osha,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,You've been having those dreams again.
3517,bran stark,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,I don't dream.
3518,osha,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,Everyone dreams.
3519,bran stark,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. (Bran looks up at the comet). They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
3520,osha,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,"Did they? (Hodor is kneeling next to the pool in the godswood. Osha begins unstrapping Bran from Hodor’s back). I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father."
3521,osha,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,"The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons."
3522,bran stark,2,11,the north remembers,WINTERFELL_1,The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries.
3523,doreah,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,"What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?"
3524,daenerys targaryen,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,He said they ate meat.
3525,doreah,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,He didn't tell you what kind of meat?
3526,daenerys targaryen,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.
3527,daenerys targaryen,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,She was Drogo's first gift to me.
3528,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,I remember.
3529,daenerys targaryen,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?
3530,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,"A trick I never learned, I'm afraid."
3531,daenerys targaryen,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,Does it ever end?
3532,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,"This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste."
3533,daenerys targaryen,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,And you're sure there's no other way?
3534,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,"If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons."
3535,daenerys targaryen,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,No one will take my dragons.
3536,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,"They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength."
3537,daenerys targaryen,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,(Turns to Jorah) As you are mine.
3538,daenerys targaryen,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,"(Speaking Dothraki) Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast."
3539,rakharo,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,"(Speaking Dothraki) What do we seek, Khaleesi?"
3540,daenerys targaryen,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,"(Speaking Dothraki) Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."
3541,daenerys targaryen,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,"(Speaking Dothraki) Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood."
3542,rakharo,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,"(Speaking Dothraki) I will not fail you, blood of my blood."
3543,daenerys targaryen,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,You never have.
3544,rakharo,2,11,the north remembers,ESSOS_1,This is… bad time to start.
3545,jon snow,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,Having a rough time of it?
3546,sam,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,Nothing's killed me yet.
3547,grenn,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,Your ass killed the sledge.
3548,sam,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,You offered me a ride!
3549,grenn,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.
3550,eddison tollett,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"I was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times."
3551,sam,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,Are those girls?
3552,eddison tollett,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,Craster's daughters.
3553,sam,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,I haven't seen a girl in six months.
3554,eddison tollett,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.
3555,grenn,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?"
3556,eddison tollett,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,(Smirking) He don't like people messing with his wives.
3557,eddison tollett,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters, and on, and on it goes."
3558,sam,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,That's foul.
3559,grenn,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,It's beyond foul.
3560,eddison tollett,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.
3561,jon snow,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,What happens to the boys?
3562,sam,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,Hmm?
3563,jon snow,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?
3564,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.
3565,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. (Sips his wine). Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that."
3566,jon snow,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,(Standing off to the side of the room) We're not Southerners.
3567,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?
3568,jon snow,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,Jon Snow.
3569,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North."
3570,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,The lad meant no harm.
3571,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters -
3572,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. (Turns to Jon) Now, sit down and shut your mouth."
3573,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,You bring any of that good wine with you?
3574,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?
3575,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"I could tell you, but I'm thirsty."
3576,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge. Bring it in here.
3578,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,You want to know where they've all gone? North! To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend.
3579,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers!"
3580,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"Oh, aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall."
3581,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,He's been calling himself that for years. What’s he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?
3582,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?
3583,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,Give it here.
3584,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,You'll have another one made at Castle Black. (Hands the axe to Craster). Here.
3585,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"(Inspecting the axe). Oh, that's some lovely steel. (Loudly brings the axe down). You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army. What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your southern kings."
3586,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,And where does he plan marching this army?
3587,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go."
3588,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,These are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.
3589,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"Let them come. My roots are sunk deep. (Grabs Gilly) Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are."
3590,gilly,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,This is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave.
3591,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?"
3592,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,We chose different paths.
3593,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. (Stands up).  You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs."
3594,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,(Stands up) A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you.
3595,craster,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"(Addressing the group). Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one, (Gestures towards Jon),  staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out."
3596,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,"Your roof, your rules."
3597,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,(Angrily) Who am I? (Jon looks confused) Who am I?
3598,jon snow,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,Lord commander.
3599,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,And who are you?
3600,jon snow,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,Jon Snow.
3601,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,Who are you?
3602,jon snow,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,Your steward.
3603,jorah mormont,2,11,the north remembers,BEYOND THE WALL_1,You want to lead one day? (Jon nods). Then learn how to follow.
3604,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false Gods."

3610,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,(Looks to Stannis) Not now.
3611,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,And the dead shall rise in the North.
3612,cressen,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"(Walks forward, interrupting Melisandre). All you men were named in the Light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?"
3613,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me."
3614,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you."

3619,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path."
3620,cressen,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"(Scoffs) King. Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation."
3621,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.
3622,cressen,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos. (Davos picks up the sword and inspects it).  If you tell him the truth…"
3623,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,What's the truth?
3624,matthos,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,“And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert le-”
3625,stannis baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"He wasn't my beloved brother. (Matthos looks up). I didn't love him, he didn't love me."
3626,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"A harmless courtesy, Your Grace."
3627,stannis baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,A lie. Take it out.

3630,matthos,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"""And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim -"""
3631,stannis baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight."
3632,matthos,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"(Adding Ser) ""Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros. (Stannis nods). Let all true men declare their loyalty.”"
3633,stannis baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse."
3634,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -"
3635,stannis baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.
3636,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly."
3637,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him.
3638,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
3639,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,He has no need for ships.
3640,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark."
3641,stannis baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them."
3642,cressen,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"(Stands up). I owe you an apology, my King. My duty is to serve. You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods. May the Lord of Light watch over us all. Shall we drink together?"
3643,davos seaworth,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,(Whispers to Cressen) Don't.
3644,cressen,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,A cup of wine to honor the one true God.
3645,melisandre,2,11,the north remembers,DRAGONSTONE_1,"The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away. Your Grace."
3646,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,"King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl."
3647,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,"If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, ""Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.”"
3648,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
3649,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,"Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours."
3650,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy’? Insulted?
3651,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,"You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy."
3652,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. (Grey Wind enters the cage. Jaime looks very nervous). Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. (Jaime focuses back on Robb). He's your bastard son.
3653,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,"If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him."
3654,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.
3655,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
3656,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.
3657,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
3658,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
3659,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
3660,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,"No, but he's starting to know me."
3661,jaime lannister,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,Three victories don't make you a conqueror.
3662,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_1,It's better than three defeats.
3663,shae,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,This city stinks Like dead bodies.
3664,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,"A bit corpsey, yes."
3665,shae,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,And shit.
3666,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,I thought you wanted to come here.
3667,shae,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,I love it.
3668,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
3669,shae,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,And cum and garlic and rum.
3670,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,You can smell cum from the balcony?
3671,shae,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.
3672,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,And so did the country.
3673,shae,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,This is where I belong.
3674,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,"Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here."
3675,shae,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,No one will know.
3676,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,"You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars."
3677,shae,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,What about you?
3678,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
3679,shae,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,Truth? (Laughs) You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.
3680,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,"Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, (Lays down on the bed with Shae), crushed beneath the weight of all that truth."
3681,tyrion lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,"Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here."
3682,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,Lord Baelish.
3683,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,Your Grace.
3684,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
3685,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,"Of course, Your Grace."
3686,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.
3687,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,"If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination."
3688,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
3689,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,Curious.
3690,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,"If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts."
3691,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,"Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. (Smiles) Who knows what they want?"
3692,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,"A mockingbird. (Points to a pin on Baelish’s shirt). You created your own Sigil, didn't you?"
3693,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,Yes.
3694,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
3695,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
3696,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,"I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another."
3697,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,"When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found."
3698,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,And which truth is that?
3699,petyr baelish,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,Knowledge is power.
3700,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_1,Seize him. (Cersei’s guards seize Baelish). Cut his throat. (A guard holds a knife to Baelish’s neck). Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. (The guards let Baelish go). Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. (The guards do as Cersei says). (To Baelish) Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.
3701,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,You're Ser Alton Lannister?
3702,alton lannister,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"I am, Your Grace."
3703,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals."
3704,alton lannister,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"An honorable request, Your Grace."
3705,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom."
3706,rodrik cassel,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,The King in the North.
3708,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me."
3709,alton lannister,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"These are... Your Grace, these are..."
3710,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead."
3711,alton lannister,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace."
3712,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight."
3713,theon greyjoy,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"A word, Your Grace?"
3714,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace’ when no one's around.
3715,theon greyjoy,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,It's not so bad once you get used to it.
3716,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
3717,theon greyjoy,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?"
3718,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,Of course they are.
3719,theon greyjoy,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them."
3720,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,Men who fought my father.
3721,theon greyjoy,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together."
3722,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
3723,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,I need his ships. They say he has 200.
3724,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?
3725,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
3726,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
3727,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another."
3728,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten."
3729,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet."
3730,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?"
3731,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,It's more complicated than that! You know it is.
3732,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
3733,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,You can't go to Winterfell.
3734,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,I beg your pardon?
3735,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands."
3736,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,Why in the name of all the Gods -
3737,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family."
3738,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -
3739,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good."
3740,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,I will ride at first light.
3741,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,"We will all be together again soon, I promise."
3742,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,You've done so well. Your father would be proud.
3743,robb stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,(Pauses) Give Lord Renly my regards.
3744,catelyn stark,2,11,the north remembers,NORTH_3,King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.
3745,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,What is all this?
3746,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,"Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers."
3747,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,We can't find Arya Stark.
3748,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,"With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere."
3749,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,"Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone."
3750,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. (Walks towards the throne).
3751,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
3752,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.
3753,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,His life is in danger.
3754,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.
3755,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
3756,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
3757,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
3758,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
3759,cersei lannister,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,What are you asking?
3760,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -
3761,joffrey baratheon,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,"What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. (Joffrey begins to walk away). That will be all, Mother."
3762,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,"No, no, no, no. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Ease into it. Slowly, with passion."
3763,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on. Both of you are working tonight.
3764,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,"We do things differently here, Daisy. This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall."
3765,daisy,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Haystack Hall.
3766,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Wherever you're from. Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders. (Nods to a man walking past). Lord Olsen. Taste is everything here.
3767,daisy,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Littlefinger's a fancy man.
3768,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,"Don't call him Littlefinger, he doesn't like it. Lord Baelish."
3769,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.
3770,daisy,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,She's beautiful.
3771,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,"She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot. (Janos enters the room). Lord Commander. Good to see you, again."
3772,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,"You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin. Coin which goes in many pockets."
3773,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Orders.
3774,ros (prostitute),2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Whose orders?
3775,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.
3776,mhaegen,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,"No, you can't!"
3777,mhaegen,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,No! Please! No! Not my Barra! Please. Please.
3778,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Enough. Get it done. Kill the bastard.
3779,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Give it here.
3780,gold cloak,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,"Spread out! Search every house, every room. Look in every room."
3781,blacksmith,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Gendry! His name is Gendry.
3782,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Where is the bastard?
3783,blacksmith,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,"The Night's Watch! Please, stop!"
3784,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Where?
3785,blacksmith,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,"They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north!"
3786,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,How will we know him?
3787,blacksmith,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,He's got a bull's head helmet. He made it himself.
3788,janos slynt,2,11,the north remembers,KING’S LANDING_3,Find him.

3791,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_17,You brought this on yourself.
3792,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_17,I’ve done nothing.

3802,robb stark,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,I’m sending one of your cousins down to King’s Landing with my peace terms.
3803,jaime lannister,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,You think my father’s going to negotiate with you? You don’t know him very well.
3804,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,"We won’t beat them until we take King’s Landing, and we can’t take King’s Landing without ships. My father has ships, and men who know how to sail them."
3805,robb stark,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,Men who fought my father.
3806,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,I’m his only living son. He’ll listen to me.
3807,catelyn stark,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,You don’t want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
3808,robb stark,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,I need his ships.
3809,catelyn stark,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,He is not trustworthy!
3810,joffrey baratheon,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,I heard a disgusting lie about uncle Jaime… and you. Father had other children?
3811,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,What are you asking?
3812,joffrey baratheon,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,How many bastards does he have running around?
3813,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,Where is the bastard?
3814,blacksmith,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,The Night’s Watch! Heading North!
3815,jaqen h'ghar,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,(Whispers) Boy.
3816,jaqen h'ghar,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,(Whispers) Lovely boy.
3817,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,(Stops walking). What do you want?
3818,jaqen h'ghar,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,A man has a thirst. The man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend.
3819,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,(Walks toward the cave). I have friends.
3820,rorge,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,Give us a beer. Before I skin you.
3821,jaqen h'ghar,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,"A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. (Pause). You're called Arry. (Arya nods).  This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar. Once of the Free City of Lorath."
3822,rorge,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,"Hey, you little shit. Get us beer!"
3823,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,You should have asked nicely.
3824,rorge,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,Come closer. And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.
3825,jaqen h'ghar,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,(Quietly) The boy has more courage than sense.
3826,rorge,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,Come here!
3827,gendry,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.
3828,rorge,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,Come here!
3829,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,They don't scare me.
3830,gendry,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me.
3831,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing?
3832,gendry,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,What are you doing?
3833,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,They're looking for me.
3834,gold cloak,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,You're in command here?
3835,yoren,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,You're a long way from home.
3836,gold cloak,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,I asked you a question.
3837,yoren,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,"Aye, you did. You asked without manners. And I chose not to answer."
3838,gold cloak,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,(Pulls out rolled up paper and hands it to Yoren). I have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
3839,yoren,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,"Well the thing is, (Hands back the paper), these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens."
3840,yoren,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,"It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it."
3841,yoren,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.
3842,gold cloak,2,12,the night lands,Unnamed Scene_19,We're looking for a boy named Gendry. (Gendry and Arya look shocked). He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back. With more men. (To Yoren) And I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.
3843,varys,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,My lord.
3844,shae,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company."
3845,varys,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
3846,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,It was quite a battle.
3847,varys,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
3848,shae,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,And I tell him the story of how we meet.
3849,varys,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.
3850,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,(Begins to pour wine). Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
3851,shae,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
3852,varys,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,How can you tell?
3853,shae,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,I can always tell.
3854,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. (Takes a sip).
3855,varys,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends."
3856,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned."
3857,varys,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. (Kisses Shae’s hand). Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord."
3858,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,I don't like threats.
3859,varys,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,Who threatened you?
3860,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
3861,varys,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,Ned Stark was a man of honor.
3862,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
3863,varys,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting."
3864,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"“From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” (Rips up the letter). He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that."
3865,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith."
3866,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?"
3867,alton lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"I will, Your Grace."
3868,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?
3869,alton lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace."
3870,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten."
3871,alton lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"I will, Your Grace."
3872,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"Safe travels, cousin."
3873,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
3874,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,If that's everything?
3875,pycelle,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,(Holding a letter). A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.
3876,varys,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,Trouble with the wildlings?
3877,petyr baelish,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,That's why they're called wildlings.
3878,varys,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
3879,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count."
3880,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
3881,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
3882,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them."
3883,pycelle,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,The northerners are a superstitious people.
3884,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. (The other stop leaving). Mormont doesn't lie."
3885,varys,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,How do you kill a dead man?
3886,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,Apparently you burn him.
3887,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. (Walks away, followed by Varys)."
3888,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,"I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall."
3889,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_5,I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
3890,eddison tollett,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"Then I said, if the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldn't make us fart when we died."
3891,grenn,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,We fart when we die?
3892,eddison tollett,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook."
3893,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?"
3894,eddison tollett,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,We were having a serious discussion.
3895,grenn,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,Would you look at that.
3896,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
3897,grenn,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,I prefer watching them come towards me.
3898,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,I'm sure that's nice too.
3899,grenn,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"Well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, (laughs), changed."
3900,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,You were with her? How many times?
3901,grenn,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"Well, as many times as I could."
3902,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
3903,eddison tollett,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,We need more potatoes. And get another sack for the sludge. (Sam begins to walk away). Get the turnips too.
3905,gilly,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,You shouldn't touch me.
3906,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. (Long pause)."
3907,gilly,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,You're very brave.
3908,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,What’re you doing?
3909,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters."
3910,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"Hello, Gilly. What’re you doing?"
3911,gilly,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,Sam said you could help.
3912,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -"
3913,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"She's pregnant. (Gilly encourages Sam to continue). We have to take her with us, when we leave."
3914,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,What? (Stands up).
3915,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,I know it sounds a bit mad.
3916,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible."
3917,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"The Lord Commander, (Jon tries and fails to interrupt Sam), we are sworn to protect -"
3918,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,Sam we can't take her -
3919,gilly,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"Please sir, please. I can still run if I have to."
3920,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,It's just not possible.
3921,gilly,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I…"
3922,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"If it's a boy what? (Gilly looks around and then down, not answering). You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why."
3923,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,Why did you do that?
3924,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"Do what, ask her a question?"
3925,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,You were cruel.
3926,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
3927,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,I didn't touch her!
3928,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
3929,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat."
3930,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?"
3931,sam,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"I could try. (Jon looks down, annoyed). What? I've read about it. A bit."
3932,jon snow,2,12,the night lands,BEYOND THE WALL_3,"I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her."
3933,jorah mormont,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3,Khaleesi.
3934,jorah mormont,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3,You don't need to see this.
3935,daenerys targaryen,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3,He is blood of my blood.
3936,daenerys targaryen,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3,Who did this?
3937,jorah mormont,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3,"Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar."
3938,daenerys targaryen,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3,They will like it far less when I'm done with them.
3939,irri,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3,"No! (Speaking Dothraki, to Daenerys) They killed his soul!"
3940,daenerys targaryen,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3,(Speaking Dothraki) Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
3941,irri,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3,(Speaking Dothraki) They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. (Daenerys kneels to Irri’s level). He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.
3942,daenerys targaryen,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3,(Speaking Dothraki) Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.
3943,daenerys targaryen,2,12,the night lands,ESSOS_3,"(Speaking Dothraki) And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight."
3945,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1,(Removes his jacket). Looks smaller.
3947,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1,(Removes more of his clothes). They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
3949,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1,"Anyone who matters, (Takes off his shirt), this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet."
3951,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1,"They say hard places breed hard men, (Unbuttons his pants), and hard men rule the world."
3953,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1,"(Kneels down). Try smiling with your lips closed. (She does). Hmm, better."
3955,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1,(Taking off his pants). I don't blame him.
3957,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1,"Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture."
3959,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1,Your place is on this ship.
3961,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_1,I haven't paid you.
3963,petyr baelish,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"One moment, my friend. A moment."
3964,petyr baelish,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.
3965,ros (prostitute),2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"I’m sorry, my lord."
3966,petyr baelish,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,Shhh. Did he hurt you?
3967,ros (prostitute),2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"No, my lord… It’s Mhaegen."
3968,petyr baelish,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,Who?
3969,ros (prostitute),2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby."
3970,petyr baelish,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace."
3971,ros (prostitute),2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby."
3972,petyr baelish,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. (Stands up). Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen’s child. I’ll see you tomorrow. But you’ll be happy? (Roz nods and smiles). That makes me happy."
3973,podrick payne,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,More wine?
3974,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"Damn it, boy!"
3975,podrick payne,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"Apologies, my lord."
3976,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine."
3977,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,(Podrick leaves). Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.
3978,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"Myself, I prefer the improper ones."
3979,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?"
3980,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"You know your wines, my lord."
3981,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"That I do. A fine dinner, my lord."
3982,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord."
3983,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
3984,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,Wars have been started for less.
3985,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
3986,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done."
3987,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies."
3988,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,Orders are orders.
3989,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
3990,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,I never said they were the queen's orders.
3991,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman."
3992,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,You know your sister better than I do.
3993,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
3994,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,I don't listen to filth.
3995,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children."
3996,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. (Sips his wine)."
3997,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.
3998,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
3999,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
4000,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.
4001,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."
4002,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf."
4003,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here."
4004,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."
4005,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -
4006,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
4007,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
4008,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"No, we shan't."
4009,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way."
4010,bronn,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord."
4011,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,These men are under my command. (Bronn laughs). I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
4012,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
4013,bronn,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,Boys?
4014,janos slynt,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!
4015,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,To the new Commander.
4016,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,"If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?"
4017,bronn,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_7,Without question? No. I'd ask how much.
4018,lommy,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle."
4019,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,I'm not afraid of no battles.
4020,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants."
4021,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,I've seen lots of battles. I saw -
4022,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,Liar.
4023,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.
4024,lommy,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,Two men fighting isn't a battle.
4025,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,They had armor on.
4026,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,So?
4027,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"So, if they got armor on, it's a battle."
4028,lommy,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"No, it isn't."
4029,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?
4030,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"(Gendry walks over to get more water). Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle."
4031,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,(Hesitates) It's when they've got armor on.
4032,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,Now who told you that.
4033,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,A knight?
4034,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,How'd you know he was a knight?
4035,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"Well, cause he got armor on."
4036,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. (Arya smiles).
4037,hot pie,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,How'd you know?
4038,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,‘Cause I sold armor.
4039,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,What do the gold cloaks want with you?
4040,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,(Turning around) No idea.
4041,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,You're a liar.
4042,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,(Walking to camp fire). You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.
4043,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. (Follows him).
4044,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"Well, I don’t care what any of them want. No good's ever come of their questions."
4045,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,No good's ever come? Who asked questions before?
4046,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
4047,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,Who asked questions?
4048,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died."
4049,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,Lord Stark.
4050,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,See? Asking me questions is bad luck. (Walks back to river). You'll probably be dead soon.
4051,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,What did they ask about?
4052,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,My mom.
4053,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,Who's your mom?
4054,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
4055,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,And who was your father?
4056,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?"
4057,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,I'm not a girl!
4058,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,(Walks back to camp fire). Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
4059,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that."
4060,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,That's true. You're still a girl.
4061,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,I am not!
4062,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then."
4063,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can’t know. No one can know.
4064,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,They won't. Not from me.
4065,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
4066,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
4067,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.
4068,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady."
4069,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -"
4070,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"You were a lord's daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady."
4071,arya stark,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,Do not call me milady.
4072,gendry,2,12,the night lands,WOODS_1,"As milady commands. (Arya pushes him). Well, that was unladylike."
4074,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. (The man makes no response). The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. (The man continues to make no response). Me.
4076,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,I need to get to Pyke.
4078,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,I'm heading that way. I can take you there.
4079,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,I bet you can.
4080,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?
4081,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,None like you.
4082,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,You don't know what I'm like.
4083,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?
4084,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.
4085,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,Have my things sent up to the castle.
4086,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,"You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years."
4087,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?
4088,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,Don't you worry about my hands. (Theon begins fondling her). The sea's in my blood.
4089,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
4090,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,"I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky."
4091,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,Is that an offer from my future king?
4092,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,"An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night."
4093,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
4094,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,Father.
4095,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,"Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?"
4096,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,A man. Your blood and your heir.
4097,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.
4098,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,Lord Stark is gone.
4099,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,And how do you feel about that?
4100,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
4101,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,Who gave you those clothes? (Stands up).  Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?
4102,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,"If my clothes offend you, I will change them."
4103,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,It will. (Begins walking forward). That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? (Theon looks down). I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?
4104,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,Gold.
4105,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. (Balon walks towards the fireplace and looks into it). My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.
4106,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,(Steps forward). My blood is salt and iron.
4107,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,"Yet, (Turns around), the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message."
4108,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,"The offer he makes, is one I proposed."
4109,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,He heeds your counsel?
4110,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,"I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother."
4111,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,"No, not here, (Walks forward), not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?"
4112,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.
4113,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.
4114,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,I will lead the attack myself.
4115,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,"Oh, you will?"
4116,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
4117,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,I told you to wait outside. (The person who entered is revealed to be Yara). How did you get past the guards?
4118,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
4119,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,(Puts his arm around her). My dear.
4120,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,Yara?
4121,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,"So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about."
4122,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,She can't lead an attack!
4123,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,And why not?
4124,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,You're a woman!
4125,yara greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,You're the one in skirts.
4126,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,"This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him."
4128,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,(Watching the letter burn in his hand). No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. (Throws the letter in the fire). That is who I am. That is who we have always been.
4129,theon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
4130,balon greyjoy,2,12,the night lands,IRON ISLANDS_3,Who said anything about the Lannisters?
4131,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
4132,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?"
4133,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey."
4134,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"And yet, they both have larger armies."
4135,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.
4136,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.
4137,matthos,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"Mind your words, pirate. (They all stop walking)."
4138,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,Matthos.
4139,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.
4140,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them."
4141,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,That's a promise that always comes true.
4142,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong"
4143,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,Only the clever ones.
4144,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing."
4145,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
4146,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,It is. (Matthos rolls his eyes).
4147,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"One thing, I want the queen."
4148,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,The queen?
4149,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well."
4150,matthos,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
4151,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her."
4152,matthos,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,As if she would just let you!
4153,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.
4154,matthos,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god."
4155,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs."
4156,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
4157,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
4158,matthos,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,You believe your king can win?
4159,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,He is the one true king.
4160,salladhor saan,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. (They laugh). I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich."
4161,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
4162,matthos,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,When will the King have a sail?
4163,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,As soon as his God wills it.
4164,matthos,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. (As they walk). Let me teach you how to read."
4165,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,Oh you and your mother.
4166,matthos,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
4167,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!"
4168,matthos,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,But you always came home.
4169,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,I wasn't praying.
4170,matthos,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"(They reach their horses). But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you."
4171,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis."
4172,matthos,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,"(As Davos is mounting his horse). Stannis is my king, but he's only a man."
4173,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_3,Don't tell him that.
4174,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9,Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
4175,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9,I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
4176,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9,You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
4177,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9,"Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"
4178,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9,"Ha, the people. You think I care?"
4179,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9,"You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” (Cersei says nothing). You don't even have the decency to deny it."
4180,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9,"It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse."
4181,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9,"He did what needed to be done. (Now loudly). You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."
4182,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9,"I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
4183,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9,"I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. (Sits down). It's all fallen on me."
4184,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9,"(Tries not to laugh). As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
4185,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9,"You're funny. (Laughs). You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death."
4186,tyrion lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9,She was my mother too.
4187,cersei lannister,2,12,the night lands,KING’S LANDING_9,"Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. (Storms out)."

4191,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
4192,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,"In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men."
4193,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,Does seem the wiser choice.
4194,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
4195,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,"Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him."
4196,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,"Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us."
4197,davos seaworth,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,"At once, Your Grace."

4200,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,What did you say to him?
4201,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,I told him death by fire is the purest death.
4202,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,Why?
4203,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
4204,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,Yeah.
4205,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
4206,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,Tell your lord to burn them then.
4207,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
4208,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
4209,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,You must have faith.
4210,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,"Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten."
4211,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,Then we must be the ten.
4212,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,"I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole."
4213,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,"I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."
4214,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,"I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols."
4215,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,You must give... all of yourself.
4216,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,I have a wife. I took a vow.
4217,melisandre,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,"She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. (Whispers in his ear). I will give you a son, my King."
4218,stannis baratheon,2,12,the night lands,DRAGONSTONE_5,(Gasps). A son?

4232,jeor mormont,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1",Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.

4234,jeor mormont,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_1","Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster."

4242,sam,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, THE NEXT MORNING_1",Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
4243,gilly,2,13,what is dead may never die,"CRASTER'S KEEP, THE NEXT MORNING_1","You, you shouldn't give it away."

4336,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1",I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.

4339,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1",But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.

4345,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1",Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.

4347,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1","It's a compliment, my lady."
4348,shae,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1",How is being a weakness a compliment?
4349,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1",Language can be a bit tricky here.

4383,shae,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",She wasn't in this city.
4384,sansa stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1","(testily, with a wavering voice) I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around.

4388,pycelle,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily."
4389,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1",Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.

4393,pycelle,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","Why, yes, of course, my lord."
4394,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1",These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
4395,pycelle,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","Matrimony, huh? Yes."
4396,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."
4397,pycelle,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave."
4398,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it."
4399,pycelle,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1",Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
4400,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","But remember, the Queen mustn't know."

4402,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1",I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
4403,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark."
4404,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1",Precisely.
4405,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1",Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
4406,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","But remember, you must tell no one."
4407,petyr baelish,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1",Tell no one what?
4408,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1",I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
4409,petyr baelish,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1",She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
4410,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
4411,petyr baelish,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1",And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
4412,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1",Who better?
4413,petyr baelish,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"
4414,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal."
4415,petyr baelish,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1",Harrenhal is cursed.
4416,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands."
4417,petyr baelish,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm."
4418,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1",You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
4419,petyr baelish,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away."
4420,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, DAY_1","I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?"

4426,loras tyrell,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",(scoffs) A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.

4431,loras tyrell,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1","No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone."
4432,loras tyrell,2,13,what is dead may never die,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.

4441,renly baratheon,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1",You certainly don't need it.
4442,renly baratheon,2,13,what is dead may never die,"RENLY'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1","Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed."

4482,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",Find him?
4483,bronn,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1","Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt."
4484,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1","No, you don't."
4485,bronn,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1","No, I don't."

4487,pycelle,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1","No, please, please."
4488,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1","You disappoint me, Grand Maester."
4489,pycelle,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1",I am your loyal servant.
4490,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1",So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
4491,pycelle,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1","No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider."
4492,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1","See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you."

4505,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1",So you poisoned him?

4509,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1",Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
4510,pycelle,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1","Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!"
4511,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, BROTHEL_1",For your trouble.

4513,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",Good. One of my better ideas.
4514,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
4515,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day."
4516,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
4517,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?"
4518,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","Why, am I about to hear one?"
4519,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?"
4520,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",Depends on the sellsword.
4521,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
4522,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","He has a sword, the power of life and death."
4523,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?"
4524,tyrion lannister,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3",I've decided I don't like riddles.
4525,varys,2,13,what is dead may never die,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_3","Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."

4528,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,I don't like the taste.
4529,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"(chuckles) Well... You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest."
4530,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,What?
4531,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,How do you sleep?
4532,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"Same as most men, I think."
4533,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"But you've seen things, horrible things."
4534,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many."
4535,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,How do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?
4536,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,You didn't see that. I made damn sure.
4537,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and... and my sister."
4538,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lad's name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?"
4539,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves."
4540,gendry,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,Get up.
4541,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,Get up.
4542,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"Keep out of sight, both of you."
4543,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"No, I'm not afraid."
4544,gendry,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,I can fight.
4545,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"(pointing at both of them) Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back."
4546,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"(yelling) Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!"
4551,amory lorch,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"Where's the bastard, crow?"
4552,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,Got more than a few bastards here. Who's asking?
4553,amory lorch,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"Ser Amory Lorch, sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister. These men from the capital requested our assistance. Drop your weapons in the name of the King."
4554,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"Now, which king would that be?"
4555,amory lorch,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"This is your last chance. In the name of King Joffrey, drop your weapons."
4556,yoren,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,I don't think I will.
4557,amory lorch,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,So be it.

4565,polliver,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,What do we have here?
4566,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,No!
4567,polliver,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,That's a fine little blade. Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
4568,hot pie,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,I yield! I yield!
4570,polliver,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,You heard him. You're coming with us.
4571,hot pie,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,I yield!

4574,lommy,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,Look at it.
4575,polliver,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,Can you walk?
4576,lommy,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,No. You got to carry me.
4577,polliver,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,All right.
4578,polliver,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,"""Carry him,"" he says."
4579,amory lorch,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,We're looking for a bastard named Gendry. Give him up or I'll start taking eyeballs.
4580,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,You want Gendry?
4581,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,You already got him.
4582,arya stark,2,13,what is dead may never die,RIVERLANDS_1,He loved that helmet.
4584,rennick,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,Bulls are bigger than lions. Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.
4586,rennick,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,If he ever gets out.
4588,rennick,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.
4590,rennick,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,"How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead."
4591,rennick,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.
4593,rennick,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,Shh. Do you hear that?
4595,rennick,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,There's something out there.
4597,rennick,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,"I swear you pissed yourself. ""Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"""
4599,rennick,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,"Yeah, don't even try me."
4601,rennick,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,Do you think I'm an idiot?
4605,roose bolton,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own.
4606,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,"We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton."
4607,roose bolton,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,"Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans."
4608,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,I doubt it.
4609,roose bolton,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,"Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, ""A naked man has few secrets. ""A flayed man none."""

4624,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,You'll die if she doesn't.
4626,roose bolton,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.
4627,talisa stark,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,"Your men are not my men, my lord."
4628,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.
4630,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,Unnamed Scene_21,"Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me."
4631,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,What's your name?
4632,talisa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,Talisa.
4633,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,Your last name?
4634,talisa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,You want to know what side my family fights on?
4635,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.
4636,talisa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,That boy lost his foot on your orders.
4637,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,They killed my father.
4638,talisa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,That boy did?
4639,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,The family he fights for.
4640,talisa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
4641,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,I have no hatred for the lad.
4642,talisa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,That should help his foot grow back.
4643,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,"You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey."
4644,talisa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,You're going to kill Joffrey?
4645,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,If the gods give me strength.
4646,talisa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,And then what?
4647,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
4648,talisa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,So who will?
4649,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,I don't know.
4650,talisa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,"You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?"
4651,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,First we have to win the war.
4652,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,You never told me where you're from.
4653,talisa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,Volantis.
4654,robb stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.
4655,talisa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,He was unlucky that you were.
4656,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.
4657,sansa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,"Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please"

4659,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,"Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain."
4660,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,Killing you would send your brother a message.
4661,sansa stark,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,(cries)
4662,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn.
4663,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,Leave her face. I like her pretty.
4664,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,"Meryn, my lady is overdressed. Unburden her."
4665,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,"If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder."
4666,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,What is the meaning of this?
4667,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
4668,meryn trant,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,"The kind who serves his king, Imp."
4669,bronn,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,"Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak."
4670,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
4671,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,I'm punishing her.
4672,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,"For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit."
4673,joffrey baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!
4674,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD_1,The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?

4883,polliver,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just-"
4884,tywin lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?
4885,tywin lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","You, do you have a trade?"
4886,gendry,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Smith, my lord."
4887,polliver,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy."
4888,tywin lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?"
4889,arya stark,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Safer to travel, my lord."
4890,tywin lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.
4891,gregor clegane,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",My lord.
4892,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Your visits are too few, cousin."
4893,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle. Here's your warrant."
4894,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
4895,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp."
4896,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?"
4897,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately."
4898,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
4899,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",As I said several times.
4900,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
4901,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay."
4902,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf."
4903,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn.
4904,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
4905,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl."
4906,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",I am a knight!
4907,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?"
4908,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
4909,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
4910,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",It's not my fault!
4911,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?"
4912,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything."
4913,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Did he tell you to fuck her, too?"
4914,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",I only meant I did as I was bid.
4915,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this."
4916,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you."
4917,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
4918,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear."
4919,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","No, I think not."
4920,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",My lord?
4921,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me."
4922,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command."
4923,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent."
4924,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",But her demands?
4925,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Oh, I'll give her Pycelle."
4926,lancel lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",You will?
4927,tyrion lannister,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length."
4928,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Your Grace.
4929,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?
4930,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean."
4931,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Fewer.
4932,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Pardon?
4933,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
4934,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
4935,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good."
4936,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
4937,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Does he listen?
4938,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest"
4939,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
4940,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",I've lived within the law for seventeen-
4941,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",I want you to be a smuggler this time.
4942,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?"
4943,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
4944,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways."
4945,stannis baratheon,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Cleaner ways don't win wars.
4946,melisandre,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Are you afraid, Onion Knight?"
4947,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
4948,melisandre,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?"
4949,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad."
4950,melisandre,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil."
4951,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",And which are you?
4952,melisandre,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life."
4953,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Well, that must be very nice for you."
4954,melisandre,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Do you love your wife?
4955,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",I do.
4956,melisandre,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Yet you have known other women.
4957,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Don't talk about my wife.
4958,melisandre,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe."
4959,melisandre,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",And you will.
4960,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
4961,melisandre,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are."
4962,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
4963,melisandre,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",They can't bar our passage.
4964,davos seaworth,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1",Gods protect us.
4965,melisandre,2,14,garden of bones,"HARRENHAL, COURTYARD_1","There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him."
4966,renly baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,You swear it?
4967,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
4968,renly baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,"Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty."
4969,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,And the wording of this oath?
4970,renly baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,"The same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together."
4971,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,And in return for my son's loyalty?
4972,renly baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,"In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army."
4973,renly baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,"When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before."
4974,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,"Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother."
4975,renly baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.
4976,renly baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
4977,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,No! No.
4980,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,"No, wait, it wasn't her!"
4981,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.
4984,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,I won't leave him.
4985,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,You can't avenge him if you're dead.
4987,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,Unnamed Scene_22,Not that way.
4988,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,We need to go home. Loras.
4989,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"My lord, my lady."
4990,loras tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,Get out.
4991,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king."
4992,loras tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,And you want that privilege for yourself.
4993,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis."
4994,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,There's no time for this.
4995,loras tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis."
4996,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
4997,loras tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?
4998,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,Stannis.
4999,loras tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,I will put a sword through his righteous face.
5000,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,You can't stay here.
5001,loras tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"He would have been a true king, a good king."
5002,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?"
5003,loras tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,Revenge.
5004,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."
5005,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.
5006,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,He was very handsome.
5007,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"He was, Your Grace."
5008,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"""Your Grace."" Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen."
5009,petyr baelish,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,Do you want to be a queen?
5010,margaery tyrell,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,No. I want to be the queen.
5011,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,Killed? By whom?
5012,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
5013,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,Really? Who'd have thought?
5014,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
5015,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"Whomever did it, I say well done."
5016,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."
5017,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
5018,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
5019,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?"
5020,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,She'll be safer in Dorne.
5021,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."
5022,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
5023,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
5024,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
5025,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
5026,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
5027,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
5028,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,It's important that we talk about this.
5029,cersei lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
5030,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,It's wildfire.
5031,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
5032,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,No.
5033,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,MThat's a lie right there.
5034,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
5035,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
5036,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,I'm telling you the truth.
5037,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,The smart money would be on more likely.
5038,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,She's making wildfire.
5039,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
5040,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
5041,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,I suppose there's only one way to find out.
5042,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.
5043,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,When did she tell you this?
5044,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you."
5045,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,Swear to me on what?
5046,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,On my life.
5047,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,But I don't care about your life.
5048,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow..."
5049,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out."
5050,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,"Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me."
5051,lancel lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.
5052,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE STORMLANDS SHORE_1,It will be my pleasure.
5053,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",Your Grace.
5054,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",What is it?
5055,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3","I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him."
5056,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3","Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
5057,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
5058,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
5059,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3","Your Grace, I-"
5060,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
5061,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",And I've never known you to hide from the truth.
5062,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",You've come to lecture me on truth?
5063,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",I've come to tell you that what I saw.
5064,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3","All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne."
5065,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3","Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron"
5066,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",I'll hear no more about it.
5068,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",When do we sail for King's Landing?
5069,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3","As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."
5070,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
5071,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",That's not your concern.
5072,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3","If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers."
5073,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
5074,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",Loyal service means telling hard truths.
5075,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3","Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?"
5076,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
5077,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",What do you believe?
5078,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
5079,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
5080,davos seaworth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3","Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy."
5081,stannis baratheon,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3","Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."
5085,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3","Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?"
5086,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
5087,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3","Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
5088,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
5089,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3","He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."
5093,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",It's hard to argue with his assessment.
5094,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",Not after what he did to your birthday present.
5095,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
5097,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",You have to admire his imagination.
5098,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",He's talking about you.
5099,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",What? Demon monkey?
5100,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.
5101,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
5102,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",You don't need to convince me.
5103,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, RENLY'S CAMP_3",Demon monkey.
5105,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.
5106,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!
5107,black lorren,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","Where are we headed, Captain?"
5108,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well."
5109,black lorren,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",And who decides if we've done our jobs well?
5110,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",I do. Your captain.
5111,black lorren,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?"
5112,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."
5113,black lorren,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",(laughs)
5114,yara greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",Stop. We yield.
5115,yara greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",Congratulations on your first command.
5116,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
5117,yara greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got thirty ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow."
5118,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
5119,yara greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore."
5120,dagmer,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","Come on, I'll take you out."
5121,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",Who are you?
5122,dagmer,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","Dagmer, your first mate."
5123,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
5124,dagmer,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
5125,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
5126,dagmer,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",You're not.
5127,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
5128,dagmer,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?
5129,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
5130,dagmer,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?"
5131,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-"
5132,theon greyjoy,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",Take me to my ship.
5133,reginald lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed."
5134,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.
5135,amory lorch,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
5136,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?"
5137,reginald lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep."
5138,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you."
5139,reginald lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",My wife's in Lannisport.
5140,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head."
5141,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!"
5142,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?"
5143,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","Maidenpool, my lord."
5144,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
5145,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","House Mooton, my lord."
5146,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",And what is their sigil?
5147,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?"
5148,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",(nods)
5149,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","Good. One more time, where are you from?"
5150,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown."
5151,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
5152,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",They call him the Young Wolf.
5153,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",And?
5154,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.
5155,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",And do you believe them?
5156,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","No, my lord. Anyone can be killed."
5157,tywin lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",Fetch that water.
5158,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",A girl says nothing.
5159,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",(gasps)
5160,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl."
5161,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",I was always a girl.
5162,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.
5163,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.
5164,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
5165,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",I didn't have a choice.
5166,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",You did. I did. And here we are.
5167,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",A man pays his debts. A man owes three.
5168,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",Three what?
5169,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done."
5170,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",I can name anyone and you'll kill him?
5171,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",A man has said.
5172,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",The one who tortures everyone.
5173,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",A man needs a name.
5174,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1",I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.
5175,jaqen h'ghar,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"IRON ISLANDS, MORNING_1","That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty."
5176,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,"He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn."
5177,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,When will he come?
5178,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,The Halfhand does things in his own time.
5179,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,My uncle told me stories about him.
5180,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,Most of them are true.
5181,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
5182,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.
5183,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
5184,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,"Well, possible for the Halfhand."
5185,sam,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,"Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here."
5186,dolorous edd,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,(to GRENN) There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.
5188,sam,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,"The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men."
5189,dolorous edd,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,"Before I die, please, stop talking."
5190,sam,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,"Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?"
5191,dolorous edd,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
5192,grenn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,(laughs)
5193,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
5194,grenn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,Wildlings?
5195,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
5196,dolorous edd,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,"So you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes."
5197,sam,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,"And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times."
5198,grenn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,"But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?"
5199,sam,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,Well I read it in a book.
5200,dolorous edd,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,I read it in a book.
5201,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,THE NORTH_1,Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.
5202,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1","Take care, my lord."
5203,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1","I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, ""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. """
5204,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1","Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow."
5205,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1","After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power."
5206,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1",(scoffs)
5207,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1",My companion takes issue.
5208,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1",If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
5209,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1",Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
5210,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1",To do what?
5211,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1",The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
5212,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1",How much do you have?
5213,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1","If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father."
5214,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1","My lord, this man is insulting."
5215,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1","I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down."
5216,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1",My friend remains unconvinced.
5217,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1",He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
5218,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1","Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks."
5219,hallyne,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1","We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both."
5220,bronn,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1",This is a shit idea.
5221,tyrion lannister,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"KING'S LANDING, CELLAR_1","I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me."
5222,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,Dracarys. Dracarys.
5223,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,He'll be able to feed himself from now on.
5224,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,"Let him sleep, Doreah."
5225,doreah,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,"Yes, Khaleesi."
5226,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,(amused) He loves you.
5227,irri,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,(Dothraki) I rewove this part of the top. And I fixed the heel on this one.
5228,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,"Thank you, my friend."
5229,doreah,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.
5230,irri,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,It is known.
5231,doreah,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos-
5232,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,"The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo."
5233,irri,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,(Dothraki) May he ride forever through the night lands.
5234,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,"Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy."
5235,doreah,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,(chuckles) You would look like a real princess in Xaro's-
5236,irri,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,"She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi. You should wear it, Khaleesi."
5237,irri,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,You are their guest. It would be rude not to.
5239,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,It sounds wonderful.
5241,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,Please excuse me for a moment.
5242,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,(speaks Dothraki)
5243,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,What are they doing?
5244,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,"Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry."
5245,kovarro,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,(Dothraki) Or melt it. Very simple.
5246,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,(Dothraki)  We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
5247,kovarro,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,"(Dothraki) Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave."
5248,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,(Dothraki) Not even when we leave.
5249,kovarro,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,(Dothraki) Why not?
5250,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,(Dothraki) Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
5251,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
5252,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.
5253,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
5254,pyat pree,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,"Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration?"
5255,pyat pree,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once.
5256,pyat pree,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,"Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons."
5257,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,My apologies. Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
5258,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,What is the House of the Undying?
5259,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,"It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic."
5260,quaithe,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,You watch over her.
5261,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,Do I know you?
5262,quaithe,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
5263,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,Who are you?
5264,quaithe,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,QARTH_1,"I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power."
5265,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",It looked like Stannis.
5266,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.
5267,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",In the shape of Stannis.
5268,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
5269,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1","Will you stay there long, my lady?"
5270,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1","Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long."
5271,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",I never knew my mother.
5272,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",I'm sorry.
5273,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.
5274,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",It's a bloody business.
5275,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",What comes after is even harder.
5276,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1","Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?"
5277,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",You mean to kill Stannis.
5278,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",I swore a vow.
5279,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
5280,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.
5281,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.
5282,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",I only held him that once as he was dying.
5283,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1","He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well."
5284,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1","I do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis."
5285,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1","When the time comes, I will not hold you back."
5286,brienne of tarth,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1","Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new."
5287,catelyn stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
5288,winterfell shepherd,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1","And it's not just thieves, my lord. There's wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen. They come down in the night and they kill my sheep. My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord. They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home. I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night."
5289,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.
5290,winterfell shepherd,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1","My wife always prayed for more children. We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord. And may the gods bless you and yours."

5292,luwin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",Good.
5293,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",Hodor.
5294,hodor,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",Hodor.
5295,rodrik cassel,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",Bran! Lord Stark. Torrhen's Square is under siege.
5296,luwin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",Torrhen's Square is barely forty leagues from here. How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
5297,rodrik cassel,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain. Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.
5298,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1",We have to help them.
5299,rodrik cassel,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1","Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather two hundred decent men."

5301,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1","If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need."
5302,rodrik cassel,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,"STORMLANDS, WOODS_1","Won't take long, my lord. Southerners don't do well up here."
5303,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,"So, what does it mean?"
5304,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,Ask your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time.
5305,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.
5306,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,"Must not mean anything, then."
5307,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,You're lying.
5308,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,"You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar."
5309,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,You know what it means.
5310,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,I never said I didn't.
5311,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,You didn't give me an honest answer.
5312,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,That's not the same as being a liar.
5313,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,"Well, it's not far off."
5314,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,"So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream. Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream?"
5315,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,"Something bad? Tell me, boy."
5316,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,"I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell. I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls. It flooded the castle. Drowned men were floating here, in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them."
5317,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,The sea is hundreds of miles away.
5318,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,I know. It's just a stupid dream.
5319,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen. Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.
5320,bran stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,"Osha. The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?"
5321,osha,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_3,They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.
5322,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,There.
5323,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Where?
5324,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,On that mountain.
5325,sam,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,I don't see very well.
5326,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,A fire.
5327,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"There's a fire. The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine. When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal. Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor."
5328,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,How many wildlings have joined him?
5329,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"From what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move."
5330,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Where?
5331,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Somewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.
5332,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,You saying we should fall back to the Wall?
5333,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"Mance was one of us once. Now he's one of them. He's going to teach them our way of doing things. They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back. They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us. So we need to be more like them, do things their way. Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. And to do that"
5334,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,We need to get rid of those lookouts.
5335,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"It's not a job for 400 men. I need to move fast and silent. Harker, Stonesnake, Borba."
5336,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin."
5337,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin. You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger."
5338,jon snow,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?
5339,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,He's the one?
5340,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
5341,qhorin,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"Craster? In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat."
5342,sam,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble."
5343,jeor mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward. Go on."
5344,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?"
5345,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend.
5346,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Unlikely. I can almost always tell what a man wants.
5347,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,And what about what a woman wants?
5348,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?"
5349,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
5350,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Why?
5351,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.
5352,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
5353,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
5354,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"Ah, a conqueror."
5355,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
5356,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo."
5357,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious."
5358,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,(chuckles)
5359,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why?"
5360,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,I will show you why.
5361,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark. I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key.
5362,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,And behind the door?
5363,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,(chuckles)
5364,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,And it can all be mine?
5365,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies. Enough to go home."
5366,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,All I have to do?
5367,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Is marry me.
5368,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,That was a romantic proposal.
5369,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses."
5370,xaro xhoan daxos,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead."
5371,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it...
5372,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country.
5373,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros."
5374,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,The usurper is dead.
5375,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,(laughs)
5376,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other."
5377,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
5378,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
5379,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way."
5380,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now."
5381,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, but you musT-"
5382,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Do not speak to me like I'm a child.
5383,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,I only want-
5384,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,What do you want? Tell me.
5385,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,To see you on the Iron Throne.
5386,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Why?
5387,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real."
5388,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"So what would you have me do, as my advisor?"
5389,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,"Make your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth."
5390,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,And how do I get the ship?
5391,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain.
5392,daenerys targaryen,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,I look forward to meeting him.
5393,jorah mormont,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Khaleesi.
5394,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,You should stand sideface.
5395,gendry,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Sideface?
5396,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Sideways.
5397,gendry,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Why?
5398,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Smaller target.
5399,gendry,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Am I fighting someone?
5400,arya stark,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,You're practicing for a fight. You should practice right.
5401,gold cloak,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Guards! Did you see anything? Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.
5402,gold cloak,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Go up the battlement.
5404,gold cloak,2,15,the ghost of harrenhal,NORTH OF THE WALL_1,Move away. Stand back. He's dead.Embed
5405,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,I've taken your castle.
5406,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,Theon?
5407,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.
5408,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,Why?
5409,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,To take the castle.
5410,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,You went with Robb.
5411,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?
5412,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,I don't know.
5413,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,Find the halfwit.
5414,dagmer,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,(nods)
5415,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.
5416,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,Why?
5417,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
5418,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,I won't.
5419,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,"Yes, you will."
5420,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,I won't. I'll never yield. We'll fight you and throw you out.
5421,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,"The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say."
5422,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,BRAN'S CHAMBERS_1,Theon. Did you hate us the whole time?
5423,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.
5424,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,Louder. Say Prince Theon.
5425,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me.
5426,farlen,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit."
5427,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"Farlen, you be silent."
5428,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do."
5429,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,All of you should do as he commands.
5430,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.
5431,farlen,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with it-
5432,ironborn,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,Shut up!
5433,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?"
5434,luwin,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,I am.
5435,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens.
5436,luwin,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,My lord.
5437,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,My Lord Greyjoy.
5438,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.
5439,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,You were here the day I was taken.
5440,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,I'm the one who took you. What of it?
5441,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,Let me serve you.
5442,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts."
5443,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again.
5444,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.
5445,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,Step aside.
5446,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,Why?
5447,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"It's your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain't letting it drown me."
5448,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,You'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time-
5449,black lorren,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,Greyjoy!
5450,black lorren,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword.
5451,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes."
5452,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people.
5453,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,They are not my people.
5454,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,King Robb thought of you as a brother.
5455,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you."
5456,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons."
5457,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home."
5458,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,If he were alive to see this
5459,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.
5460,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.
5461,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"You've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll-"
5462,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,Take him to the cells. Lock him up
5463,dagmer,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,My prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay.
5464,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.
5465,dagmer,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"No, he has to pay the iron price. They'll never respect you while he lives."
5466,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death!"
5467,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.
5468,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.
5469,luwin,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,I urge you not to make a hasty decision.
5470,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine."
5471,luwin,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do."
5472,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.
5473,dagmer,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,Come.
5474,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,No! No! Theon! Please. Ser Rodrik!
5475,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
5476,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,I'm begging you.
5477,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,Coward.
5478,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,Stop. Stop! Stop right now!
5479,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"You don't give commands anymore, little lord."
5480,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"Please, stop this. Please stop him."
5481,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"Hush now, child. I'm off to see your father."
5482,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please."
5483,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"Any last words, old man?"
5484,rodrik cassel,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost."
5485,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"Theon, please don't."
5486,rickon stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,Do something!
5487,bran stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_5,"I'll do anything, please! No, please stop it!"
5488,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!"
5489,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,There goes your pet.
5490,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,He's not a pet.
5491,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"No, you're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing."
5492,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,Ghost is different.
5493,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night."
5494,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
5495,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.
5496,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,We could do the same.
5497,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it."
5498,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,My father always said I'm of the North.
5499,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,(laughs)
5500,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,I wasn't joking.
5501,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?"
5502,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,(nods)
5503,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life."
5504,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,I'll gladly give my life.
5505,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?"
5506,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,I do.
5507,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_3,"You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us."
5508,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,Can you read?
5509,amory lorch,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,My lord?
5510,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,Can you read?
5511,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
5512,amory lorch,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"My apologies, my lord. I must have-"
5513,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this-"
5514,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,My cupbearer can read better than you.
5515,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
5517,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have twenty thousand men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us."
5518,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it."
5520,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,Mmm. Give us the room.
5521,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,(to Arya) Clear all this.
5522,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,Lord Tywin.
5523,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,(not amused) Baelish.
5524,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,Wine?
5525,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,Thank you.
5526,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,What news from the capital?
5527,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
5528,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear."
5529,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.
5530,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
5531,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
5532,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?"
5533,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers."
5534,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"Yes, yes, yes."
5535,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery-
5536,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,Wants to be queen.
5537,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"Yes, she does."
5538,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.
5539,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated."
5540,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,(to Arya) More wine for Lord Baelish.
5541,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement TYWIN"
5542,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,They have.
5543,arya stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"Pardon, my lord."
5544,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,It's only wine.
5545,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,You would ride there yourself?
5546,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"Tonight, with your leave."
5547,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl."
5548,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,And what else?
5549,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,"On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark."
5550,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,Why?
5551,petyr baelish,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
5552,tywin lannister,2,16,the old gods and the new,HARRENHAL_1,Hmm.
5553,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1,A girl.
5554,qhorin,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1,A wildling.
5555,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL._1,We could question her.

5776,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,There's no shelter anywhere.
5777,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,There is if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire-
5778,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,No fire.
5779,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,But a fire is-
5780,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,No fire.
5781,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,Have it your way.
5782,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,We'll stay warmer if we stay close.
5783,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life.
5784,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,Think they're out looking for you?
5785,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,Yes.
5786,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,Think they'll find you?
5787,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,Yes.
5788,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,"You're brave. Stupid, but brave."
5789,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,We start again at first light. Get some sleep.
5790,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,Stop moving.
5791,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,I'm just trying to get comfortable.
5792,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,Stop it!
5793,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,You're still moving.
5794,ygritte,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,Was I? I didn't notice that time.
5795,jon snow,2,16,the old gods and the new,NORTH OF THE WALL_5,(sighs)
5796,robb stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,This cannot be true.
5797,roose bolton,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I'm afraid it is true."
5798,robb stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Why? Why would Theon-
5799,roose bolton,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.
5800,robb stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,My brothers?
5801,roose bolton,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,We've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
5802,catelyn stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!"
5803,robb stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,I must go north at once.
5804,roose bolton,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"There's still a war to win, Your Grace."
5805,robb stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't-
5806,roose bolton,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,You are a king. And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.
5807,catelyn stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Let me go and talk to Theon.
5808,robb stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,There will be no talk. He will die for this.
5809,roose bolton,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head."
5810,robb stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,ROBB'S COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself."
5811,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
5812,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,I'm no liar.
5813,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.
5814,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,"I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord."
5815,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.
5816,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,"There are other ways to serve, my lord."
5817,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,"I'm a prince now, and you'd do well-"
5818,asha greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,"There are other ways to serve, my prince."
5819,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,Like what?
5820,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,"We know things, the free people."
5821,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?
5822,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,Other things.
5823,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,Savage things.
5824,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,Wait outside.
5825,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,I always wondered what you had under there.
5826,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,It comes at a price.
5827,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,I'm not killing you. That's your price.
5828,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,I already had that.
5829,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,"What do you want then, other than your miserable life?"
5830,asha greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,What all free people want. My freedom.
5831,theon greyjoy,2,16,the old gods and the new,WINTERFELL_5,"Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well."
5832,sansa stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",Ow!
5833,shae,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",Shh. It's not deep.
5834,sansa stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",I thought they were going to kill me.
5835,shae,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1","They thought so, too."
5836,sansa stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1","He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me."
5837,shae,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",Of course he did.
5838,sansa stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",Why? Why would a stranger-
5839,shae,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead.
5840,sansa stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them.
5841,shae,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",Don't say these things. If the wrong people hear you-
5842,sansa stark,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",But you're not the wrong people.
5843,shae,2,16,the old gods and the new,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1",Don't trust anybody. Life is safer that way.
5845,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,"WINTERFELL, NIGHT_1",I have something for you from Prince Theon.
5847,osha,2,16,the old gods and the new,"WINTERFELL, NIGHT_1",Me. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm.
5848,daenerys targaryen,2,16,the old gods and the new,"QARTH, GARDEN PATH_1",The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
5849,xaro xhoan daxos,2,16,the old gods and the new,"QARTH, GARDEN PATH_1","When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks.

I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets."

5854,theon greyjoy,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_7,"The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?"

5856,theon greyjoy,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_7,Right. Get the horses and the hounds.

5890,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,Let's move.
5891,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,"It is the first time. How old are you, boy?"

5893,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets-

5895,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,"What, stones? Or bone?"
5896,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,Neither. Both.
5897,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,Move!
5898,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,"I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?"
5899,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,"There are no women of the Night's Watch, no."
5900,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,So the lads just do it with each other?
5901,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,No.
5902,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,Never?
5903,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,Never. We swore an oath.
5904,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,"You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable."
5905,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,Would you please shut up?
5906,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,"Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman."
5907,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,You're a free woman?
5908,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,"I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman."
5909,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,"If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what ""prisoner"" means."
5910,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
5911,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,It was my choice to say the words.
5912,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,So you don't like girls?
5913,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,Of course I like girls.
5914,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,But you chose never to touch them.
5915,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
5916,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,"So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands-"
5917,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,"Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!"
5918,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
5919,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,"My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours."
5920,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,NORTH OF THE WALL_7,So why are you fighting us?
5922,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.
5923,gregor clegane,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,We hanged twenty men last night.
5924,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,I don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
5925,gregor clegane,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
5926,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one."
5927,gregor clegane,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence."
5929,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Mmm. Is that mutton?
5930,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"Yes, my lord."
5931,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Don't like mutton.
5932,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,I'll bring something else.
5933,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Leave it. Are you hungry?
5934,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,No.
5935,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Of course you are. Eat.
5936,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,I'll eat in the kitchen later.
5937,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer. Sit. Eat.
5938,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
5939,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,I eat a lot. I just don't grow.
5940,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.
5941,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Have you ever lost before?
5942,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
5943,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,(shakes her head)
5944,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months."
5945,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.
5946,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?"
5947,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Dragons?
5948,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Yes. Dragons happened.
5949,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name"
5950,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Aegon and his sisters.
5951,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Mmm?
5952,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too."
5953,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"Correct. A student of history, are you?"
5954,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
5955,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
5956,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
5957,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?"

5961,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
5962,arya stark,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,From my father.
5963,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.

5966,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"And, girl."
5967,tywin lannister,2,17,a man without honor,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_3,"""M'lord."""

5974,sandor clegane,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1,Brave? A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.
5975,sansa stark,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1,Does it give you joy to scare people?

5978,sandor clegane,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1,Spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.
5979,sansa stark,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1,It was his duty. He never liked it.
5980,sandor clegane,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1,Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is.
5981,sansa stark,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1,Why are you always so hateful?
5982,sandor clegane,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_1,You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king.
5983,xaro xhoan daxos,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1,I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen. One of them did this or knows who did.
5984,daenerys targaryen,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1,You are one of the Thirteen.
5985,xaro xhoan daxos,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1,"If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them. They mean nothing to me on their own."
5986,daenerys targaryen,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1,Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.
5987,xaro xhoan daxos,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1,Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.
5988,daenerys targaryen,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1,"There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?"
5989,xaro xhoan daxos,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1,"I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof."
5990,daenerys targaryen,2,17,a man without honor,QARTH GARDEN_1,But it did happen under your roof.

5993,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_1,"You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was."
5994,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_1,"No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall."
5995,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_1,"We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night."
5996,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_1,You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.
5997,jon snow,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_1,Walk.
5998,ygritte,2,17,a man without honor,THE FAR NORTH_1,I could teach you how to do it.

6010,robb stark,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1",Is there room for Ser Alton?
6011,rickard karstark,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1",Does he need to lie down?
6012,robb stark,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1",Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.
6013,rickard karstark,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1",Torrhen.
6014,robb stark,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1",That will be all.

6017,robb stark,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1","And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning."
6018,talisa stark,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1",They're not my enemies.
6019,robb stark,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1",That's what I tell my bannermen.
6020,talisa stark,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1","I've already run through the supplies I brought with me. Some are easily replaced. Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses."
6021,robb stark,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1",But some are not.
6022,talisa stark,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1",I need silk for stitching.
6023,talisa stark,2,17,a man without honor,"THE RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP_1","I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy. You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any. I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over."

I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out.

6133,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1","That's right. I ran up and volunteered. ""Let me, my lord. Let me."" My father was furious. Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family."
6134,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1","You didn't, though."
6135,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",You really remember?
6136,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1","You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them."
6137,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",When I think back to that day-
6139,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",You were saying?
6140,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",I- Never mind. It's embarrassing.
6141,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
6142,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1","I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about."
6143,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",I understand completely.
6144,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1","How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you."
6145,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1","It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice."
6146,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",Which knight was it?
6147,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
6148,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",What was he like?
6149,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1","He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
6150,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",It's hard to put into words.
6151,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1","It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life."
6152,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",(nods) Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
6153,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",Did you squire for him again?
6154,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1","No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire."
6155,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",(smiles)
6156,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1","It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint."
6157,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",And have you thought about
6158,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",Of course. Every day.
6159,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",And?
6160,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1","Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful."
6161,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",(nods)
6162,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1","But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now."
6163,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",What is it?
6164,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",It's actually quite simple.
6165,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1","Well, let me help you."
6166,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",You'll only have to do one thing.
6167,alton lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",Tell me.
6168,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,"RIVERLANDS, STARK CAMP, NIGHT_1",(whispers)You'll have to die.

6192,xaro xhoan daxos,2,17,a man without honor,"QARTH, COUNCIL OF THE THIRTEEN_1",There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement.

6235,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,How many times can you read one raven scroll?
6236,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships."
6237,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,More than we have.
6238,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind."
6239,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above."

6241,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?"
6242,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
6243,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
6244,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
6245,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
6246,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,I thought the girls might help him.
6247,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,Did you?
6248,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,I was wrong. If we can't control him
6249,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.
6250,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
6251,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.
6252,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,The boy is more Robert than Jaime.
6253,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins."
6254,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,Sins?
6255,cersei lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""
6256,tyrion lannister,2,17,a man without honor,KING'S LANDING_5,"You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them."

6266,brienne of tarth,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,"The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?"
6267,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,Come.
6268,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,I need to be alone with him.
6270,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,"Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him."
6271,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,"Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?"
6272,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,Do you hear them out there? They want your head.
6273,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
6274,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,You strangled his son with your chains.
6275,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.
6276,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
6277,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,"So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?"
6278,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,"She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer."
6279,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,"Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back."
6280,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,You are a man without honor.
6281,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,"Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?"
6282,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,Brienne.
6283,jaime lannister,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,"No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman."
6284,catelyn stark,2,17,a man without honor,ROBB'S CAMP AT NIGHT_1,(to BRIENNE) Your sword.
6285,theon greyjoy,2,17,a man without honor,WINTERFELL_9,I told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not.

6293,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,What envy?
6294,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with twenty men.
6295,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,"You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?"
6296,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,"I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery."
6297,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,You treated them with honor? By butchering them?
6298,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,Before I had to kill them- I treated them-
6299,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,"You seized their home, as is your right. We're Ironborn, we take what we need."
6300,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,Exactly.
6301,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.
6302,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,They made me a promise
6303,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
6304,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,Don't call me
6305,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?
6306,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,"If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak."
6307,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,You are weak. And you're stupid.
6308,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,I'm warning you.
6309,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,"Go on, then. Warn me."
6310,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
6311,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,You're not. I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word.
6312,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.
6313,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,"Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out-"
6314,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.
6315,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,(to her men) Leave us.
6316,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,"Theon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother. We both endured our father. Come home with me. Don't die here alone."
6317,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,I don't intend to die.
6318,yara greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DINING HALL OF WINTERFELL_1,"You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea."
6319,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,"I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones."
6321,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,Mance will want to question this one. Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.
6323,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,He could have killed me half a dozen times.
6325,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,"He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son."
6326,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,Mance will want him.
6328,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,I don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself.
6330,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,"He runs, I'll do it meself."
6331,ygritte,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,"We're even now, Jon Snow."
6332,jon snow,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,"I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-"
6333,qhorin,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,I know.
6334,jon snow,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,The others?
6335,qhorin,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,"When you didn't come back, we went looking for you. We found your tracks fast enough. But they found us before we found you."
6336,jon snow,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,They died because of me.
6337,qhorin,2,18,the prince of winterfell,NORTH OF THE WALL_9,See that it wasn't for nothing.
6340,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,Is she beautiful?
6341,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,I've never met her.
6342,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,What's her name?
6343,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,"Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name."
6344,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,I'm sure you'll be very happy.
6345,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,And you're marrying her for a bridge?
6346,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,An important bridge.
6347,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,Ah.
6348,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,"It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge."
6349,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,"When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father."
6350,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,"He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but"
6351,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,"Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me."
6352,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,"He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me."
6353,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,I wish I could have met him.
6354,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,He would have liked you.
6355,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,(chuckles) Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
6356,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,He didn't care much about gold or glory.
6357,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. I want the men following me to go home.
6358,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,Then why don't you?
6359,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.
6360,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,"Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean."
6361,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,That would be a start.
6363,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WOODS IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,How? How?
6364,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,Tell me this isn't true.
6365,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,Why?
6366,catelyn stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,For the girls.
6367,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,You betrayed me.
6368,catelyn stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,Robb-
6369,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
6370,catelyn stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,"Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free."
6371,rickard karstark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,"I lost one son fighting by your son's side. I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain. You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell."
6372,catelyn stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,"I grieve for your sons, my lord."
6373,rickard karstark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance. And you stole it from me.
6374,catelyn stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,"Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine."
6375,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.
6376,catelyn stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
6378,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,Send another forty with our fastest horses.
6379,catelyn stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,CATELYN'S TENT_1,Robb.
6380,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,Damn.
6381,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,"You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin."
6382,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.
6383,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,Brienne of Tarth.
6384,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,"Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another."
6385,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.
6386,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,"I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me."
6387,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,"Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer."
6388,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
6389,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,"You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent."
6390,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
6391,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,You will not provoke me to anger.
6392,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
6393,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,I've never seen you fight.
6394,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.
6395,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,All my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.
6396,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,"If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens."
6397,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,Do you take me for an idiot? In!
6398,jaime lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,"I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid."
6399,brienne of tarth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,RIVERLANDS WOODS._1,"Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer."
6400,kevan lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,King's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force. It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.
6401,tywin lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,Surrender the Iron Throne?
6402,kevan lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates. Stannis will execute them all.
6403,tywin lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,"No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep."
6404,kevan lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.
6405,tywin lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,"Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner."
6407,kevan lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell. The Greyjoys have done us a great favor. Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.
6408,tywin lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,He's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
6409,tywin lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL_5,"We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work."
6415,rorge,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_5,"Look, it's Yoren's little cunt. Used to be a boy, now it's a girl."
6416,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_5,Where's Jaqen?
6417,rorge,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_5,"Don't care. Where's your stick now, bitch? I promised to fuck you with it."
6419,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1,"You need sour cherries to make it right. And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet. That's where the real flavor is. You crush 'em up real fine. And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust."
6420,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1,Where's Jaqen?
6421,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1,How would I know?
6422,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1,I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
6423,gendry,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1,You need him?
6424,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1,He's helping me.
6425,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1,I saw him.
6426,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1,Where?
6427,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1,Where?
6428,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1,Ow!
6429,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1,Where?
6430,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1,They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.
6431,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1,On patrol. Let go of my ears.
6432,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL FORGE_1,What do you want with him anyway?
6433,quorin halfhand,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3,"Mance is gonna march on the Wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth a thousand fighting against it."
6434,jon snow,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3,They'll never trust me.
6435,quorin halfhand,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3,They might. If you do what needs to be done.
6436,jon snow,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3,What?
6437,quorin halfhand,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3,(yelling) How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?
6438,jon snow,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3,I didn't.
6439,quorin halfhand,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE NORTH_3,"I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard."
6441,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,I like to keep me hands clean.
6442,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,"Yes, but do you have to do it here?"
6443,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,You should start wearing the gold cloak.
6444,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
6445,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common
6446,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,"A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."
6447,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,"Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out."
6448,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
6449,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,"Fine, fine. No gold cloak."
6450,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,What?
6451,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,What?
6452,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,What? What? Why are you staring at me?
6453,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,(scoffs) You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
6454,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
6455,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,Stannis will be here any day.
6456,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,And one of these explains how to beat him?
6457,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,"""An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. "" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh."
6458,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
6459,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
6460,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
6461,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
6462,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,For questioning?
6463,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
6464,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,We talked about this.
6465,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,"Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Food's worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
6466,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,"The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
6467,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,"Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted."
6468,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,(nods)
6469,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,"Ah. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer."
6470,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,"Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land."
6471,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,"And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
6472,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,We could throw books at his men.
6473,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,We don't have that many books.
6474,bronn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,"We don't have that many men, either."
6475,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,What do we have?
6476,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_7,Pig shit.
6477,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,(panting) I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
6478,dolorous edd,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
6479,grenn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse.
6480,dolorous edd,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,You lack imagination.
6481,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,Where do you think Jon is right now?
6482,dolorous edd,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead.
6483,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,"He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter."
6484,grenn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,"Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you."
6485,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
6486,eddison tollett,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,So did his father.
6487,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
6488,dolorous edd,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,Great rangers never get old is the problem. Shit ones neither. It's them in the middle that last a long time.
6489,grenn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,What in seven hells is that?
6490,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.
6491,grenn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,Look.
6492,dolorous edd,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,"If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it."
6493,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,That's a Night's Watch cloak.
6494,grenn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,It's been here a long time.
6495,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,Oh. Must be dragonglass.
6496,grenn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,Dragonglass?
6497,sam,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,The maesters call it obsidian.
6498,grenn,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,Why would a brother hide it here?
6499,dolorous edd,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE FAR NORTH_5,I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
6501,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,I'm sorry. I'll-
6502,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,(annoyed) Where were you?
6503,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,A man has patrol duty.
6504,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,"Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone."
6505,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,A girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name.
6506,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
6507,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,"A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not."
6508,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.
6509,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,This a man cannot do.
6510,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,You promised you'd help me.
6511,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,"Help was not promised, lovely girl. Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name."
6512,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,And you'll kill them? Anybody?
6513,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,"By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it."
6514,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,All right. Jaqen H'ghar.
6515,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,A girl gives a man his own name?
6516,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,That's right.
6517,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.
6518,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.
6519,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,Un-name me.
6520,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,No.
6521,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,Please?
6522,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,I'll un-name you.
6523,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,Thank you.
6524,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,If you help me and my friends escape.
6525,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,This would require more than one life. This is not part of our bargain.
6526,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,"Fine, Jaqen H'ghar."
6527,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,"A girl lacks honor. If I do this thing, a girl must obey."
6528,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,A girl will obey.
6529,jaqen h'ghar,2,18,the prince of winterfell,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_7,A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
6530,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","Thank you, Podrick."
6531,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Odd little boy.
6532,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
6533,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",You and Varys both.
6534,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
6535,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",He's only a boy.
6536,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Younger boys are off fighting his war.
6537,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",He's not ready.
6538,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?"
6539,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."
6540,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us."
6541,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Do you think I'm an idiot?
6542,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
6543,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
6544,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
6545,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
6546,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
6547,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Because he doesn't have a cock.
6548,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Neither do you.
6549,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking."
6550,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",It's not that little.
6551,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",(laughs)
6552,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Why are you smiling?
6553,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Because I'm happy.
6554,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",And why are you happy?
6555,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Because I have your little whore.
6556,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",I thought you preferred blondes.
6557,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased."
6558,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Why do you care who I fuck?
6559,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."
6560,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
6561,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time."
6562,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Where did you find her?
6563,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."
6564,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
6565,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me."
6566,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","You don't buy them, you only rent them."
6567,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt."
6568,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
6569,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."
6570,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.
6571,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",I promise I will free you.
6572,ros,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Don't forget me.
6573,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Never.
6574,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1","I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid."
6575,cersei lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"KING'S LANDING, CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1",Get out.
6576,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9,Shae!
6577,shae,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9,I've been waiting all night. What is wrong?
6579,shae,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9,Then why do you look sad?
6580,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9,We have to be more careful.
6581,shae,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9,Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.
6582,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9,There are people who want to hurt me.
6583,shae,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9,I know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will.
6584,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9,I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.
6585,shae,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9,I'm yours.
6586,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9,Promise me.
6587,shae,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_9,I'm yours and you are mine.
6588,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,Still no word?
6589,roose bolton,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell. Once he captures the castle
6590,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle
6591,roose bolton,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
6592,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
6593,roose bolton,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,"A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much-"
6594,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,Any Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
6595,roose bolton,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.
6596,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,"Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace."
6597,roose bolton,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,My lady.
6598,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,How are you?
6599,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
6600,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.
6601,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.
6602,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,You have every right. You're a king.
6603,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,That's not the kind of king I want to be.
6604,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,What kind do you want to be?
6605,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
6606,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,"I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry."
6607,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,I'd like to hear you play the harp.
6608,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,"No. No, you would not."
6609,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
6610,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,"When I was twelve, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on."
6611,robb stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
6612,talisa stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,THE RIVERLANDS_1,I don't want you to marry her. But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

6617,hot pie,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1",The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages.
6618,gendry,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1",What did he want us to do about those guards?
6619,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1","He didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates."""
6620,gendry,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1",What about the guards?
6621,arya stark,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1",He didn't say anything about the guards.
6622,gendry,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1","What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think?"

6624,gendry,2,18,the prince of winterfell,"HARRENHAL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1",Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.

6635,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,"Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag."
6636,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,"My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me."
6637,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,Do you? Why?
6638,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,My father was a crabber.
6639,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,And?
6640,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,"Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink."
6641,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
6642,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.
6643,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
6644,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,Some are happy to do it to my face.
6645,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,"We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men."
6646,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,"No one has forgotten, Your Grace."
6647,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
6648,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,He was only a boy.
6649,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
6650,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,(exhales)
6651,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,"First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."
6652,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,"And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe."
6653,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
6654,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,I was relieved they did not.
6655,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,"Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
6656,davos seaworth,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,"Your Grace, I pray I serve you well."
6657,stannis baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,STANNIS'S FLEET_1,I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
6658,joffrey baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.
6659,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell."
6660,joffrey baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.
6661,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?"
6662,joffrey baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him."
6663,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you."
6664,joffrey baratheon,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
6665,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,Imagine Stannis' terror.
6666,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,I am trying.
6667,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
6668,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."
6669,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
6670,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"I wish we could, too."
6671,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,What do you want? Tell me.
6672,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"If we're going to play, you'll have to start."
6673,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock."
6674,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,A most highborn plumber.
6675,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
6676,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game."
6677,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,I do. Last thing I expected.
6678,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,And you play it well.
6679,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
6680,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
6681,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?"
6682,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats."
6683,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,We should sail there immediately.
6684,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives."
6685,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
6686,varys,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide."
6687,tyrion lannister,2,18,the prince of winterfell,KING'S LANDING_11,"One game at a time, my friend."
6688,jorah mormont,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5,"Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow."
6689,daenerys targaryen,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5,Astapor?
6690,jorah mormont,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5,We cannot stay here.
6691,daenerys targaryen,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5,They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
6692,jorah mormont,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5,"They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die."
6693,daenerys targaryen,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5,You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
6694,jorah mormont,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5,"You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve."
6695,daenerys targaryen,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5,"Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there."
6696,jorah mormont,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5,"That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong."
6697,daenerys targaryen,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5,And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
6698,jorah mormont,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5,"Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face."
6699,daenerys targaryen,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5,They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.
6700,jorah mormont,2,18,the prince of winterfell,QARTH_5,(nods)
6701,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_11,We should bury them.
6702,dagmer,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_11,I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message.
6703,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_11,"If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer."
6704,dagmer,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_11,What's this?
6705,theon greyjoy,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_11,Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.
6706,dagmer,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_11,His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now.
6707,dagmer,2,18,the prince of winterfell,WINTERFELL_11,"His wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him."
6708,osha,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS_1,Got as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
6709,luwin,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS_1,You're right so far.
6710,osha,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS_1,Who was that out there hung up at the gates?
6711,luwin,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS_1,Must have been the farmer's boys.
6712,osha,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS_1,He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
6713,luwin,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS_1,They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.
6714,osha,2,18,the prince of winterfell,DARKNESS_1,They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.
6715,matthos,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,That's it. The tide's against us.
6716,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,"Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates."
6717,matthos,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,You're coming home.
6718,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,King's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.
6719,matthos,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,"This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain."
6720,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,"Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment."
6721,matthos,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,"Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand."
6722,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,Gods be good.
6723,matthos,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,"God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us."
6724,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,But not over them?
6725,matthos,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,"Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike."
6726,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,"Well, first, we have to put it there."
6727,matthos,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,Our ships outnumber theirs ten-to-one.
6728,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,"Our army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire."
6729,matthos,2,19,blackwater,Unnamed Scene_24,I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.
6730,shae,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_3","Are you afraid, my lion?"
6731,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_3","If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."
6732,shae,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_3",I won't let them hurt you.
6733,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_3",I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
6734,shae,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_3",It is now.
6735,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_3",You can't fuck your way out of everything.
6736,shae,2,19,blackwater,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_3",I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.
6737,pycelle,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1,"As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war."
6738,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1,Your words are always wise and measured.
6739,pycelle,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1,"If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King"
6740,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1,You brought me something?
6741,pycelle,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1,"Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however-"
6742,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1,I know what ten drops will bring.
6743,pycelle,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1,"Your Grace, if I may ask-"
6744,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1,You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
6745,pycelle,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1,Yes. A siege is very-
6746,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1,"Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many."
6747,pycelle,2,19,blackwater,CERSEI'S CHAMBERS_1,Your Grace.
6749,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,To the boys!
6752,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,Drunk Lannisters.
6754,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,Thank you very much.
6756,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,"Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker."
6758,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
6759,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,"Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-"
6760,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,"Eh, you don't want to know about the third time."
6762,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
6763,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,"Welcome, friends. This round's on me."
6764,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,(whispering) I don't think he likes me.
6765,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,You think you're a hard man?
6766,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,I know it.
6767,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
6768,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,"Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me."
6769,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,Only smaller.
6770,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,And quicker. Eh?
6771,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
6772,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,Aye I expect he will someday.
6774,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_13,One more drink before the war? Shall we?
6775,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,"I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege."
6776,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,A wedding.
6777,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,"Exactly. Podrick, is that it?"
6778,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,"""Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town."
6779,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
6780,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
6781,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,Do you trust him?
6782,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,"Oddly enough, I do."
6783,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,Good.
6784,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,The map you asked for.
6785,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.
6786,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
6787,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,"I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
6788,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,"That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord."
6789,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,"Well, I'm not."
6790,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,"For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai."
6791,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,What of it?
6792,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,"You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
6793,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,"Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
6794,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
6795,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,"Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself."
6796,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,"And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut."
6797,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,"No, I don't believe you have."
6798,varys,2,19,blackwater,TYRION'S CHAMBERs_1,"One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him."
6799,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_1,They're welcoming the new king.
6800,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_1,I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.
6801,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_1,Drums!
6802,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"Remember, wait till the ships-"
6803,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,The ships are in the bay.
6804,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,They must be far enough in-
6805,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?"
6806,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
6807,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
6808,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,Don't get killed.
6809,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"Nor you, my friend."
6810,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"Oh, are we friends now?"
6811,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
6812,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"Enhances it, really."
6813,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword."
6814,bronn,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,Been spending time with fancy folks.
6815,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,Lady Sansa and Sheila.
6816,shae,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,Shae.
6817,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast."
6818,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off."
6819,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,Sansa.
6820,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"Always been a great romantic, my nephew."
6821,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"Sansa, come here."
6822,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"I will pray for your safe return, my lord."
6823,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,Will you?
6824,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,Just as I pray for the king's.
6825,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"Stay safe, my lady."
6826,shae,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"And you, my lion."
6827,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,Your king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss.
6828,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it."
6829,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.
6830,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,Will you slay him yourself?
6831,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
6832,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
6833,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
6834,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender."
6835,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too."
6836,shae,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,Some of those boys will never come back.
6837,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.
6838,shae,2,19,blackwater,KING'S LANDING_15,"Shh. Come, my lady."
6839,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1,Where's our fleet?
6840,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1,On the way.
6841,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1,Why isn't it here now? They're coming.
6842,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1,"Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question."
6843,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1,The king has asked you a question.
6844,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1,"Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy."
6845,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1,The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king-
6846,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1,"If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought."
6847,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE STREETS OF WINTERFELL_1,"That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet."
6848,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_3,Where are their ships?
6849,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_3,It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
6850,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_3,Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.
6851,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_3,"If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied."
6852,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_3,Maybe.
6853,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
6854,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
6855,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,I doubt it.
6856,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,Maybe she's jealous of you.
6857,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,Why would she be jealous?
6858,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,Sansa.
6859,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?"
6860,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,Yes.
6861,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine."
6862,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"I'm not thirsty, Your Grace."
6863,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,So? I didn't offer you water.
6864,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,What's he doing here?
6865,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
6866,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,But we have guards to defend us.
6867,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,"Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors."
6868,gold cloak,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
6869,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
6870,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
6871,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,You said he was here to protect us.
6872,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_1,He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.
6873,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1,There they are.
6874,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1,Archers to their marks.
6878,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1,Hold fast.
6880,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1,What are you doing? We need to attack them.
6881,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1,Hold fast.
6884,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE WALL OUTSIDE THE HARBOR_1,There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?
6885,matthos,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_5,There's only one ship.
6886,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_5,"Archers, stand to! Man the below! Nock."
6888,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_5,Draw! Hold.
6890,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_5,(confused) There's no one on board.
6893,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_7,Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!
6894,davos seaworth,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_9,Matthos! Get down!
6895,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_13,Prepare to land.
6897,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_13,The dwarf has played his little trick.
6899,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_13,He can only play it once.
6901,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_13,Thousands.
6902,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE BARATHEON FLEET_13,Come with me and take this city!
6903,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,"Sansa, come here, little dove."
6904,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,My queen.
6905,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,What are you doing?
6906,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,Praying.
6907,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,"You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for?"
6908,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,For the gods to have mercy on us all.
6909,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,Oh. On all of us?
6910,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,"Yes, Your Grace."
6911,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,Even me?
6912,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,"Of course, Your Grace."
6913,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,Even Joffrey?
6914,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,Joffrey is my-
6915,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,"Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four."
6916,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,Your father doesn't believe in the gods?
6917,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,"He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much."
6918,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,One for her.
6919,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,Here. Sit. Drink.
6920,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,"Not like that. Drink, girl."
6921,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.
6922,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.
6923,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,"It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits."
6924,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,And if the city should fall?
6925,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,"You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse."
6926,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,"Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink."
6927,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_3,"Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten."
6929,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_9,"He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon."
6930,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_9,They're coming. They're coming ashore.
6931,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_9,Rain fire on them.
6933,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_9,There are too many.
6934,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_9,"Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now."
6935,podrick payne,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_9,"Yes, my lord."
6936,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,BELOW THE HARBOR WALL_1,"Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat. You, too."
6937,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,BELOW THE HARBOR WALL_1,"Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts."
6945,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,HARBOR WALL_15,"To the Mud Gate, go now!"
6947,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,INSIDE THE HARBOR WALL_1,"Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse."
6948,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,"When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired."
6949,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,You were Robert's queen.
6950,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.
6951,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,Pretty.
6952,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,"That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend."
6953,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?
6954,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,"A few weeks, Your Grace."
6955,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,When did you leave Lorath?
6956,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
6957,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,(smiles)
6958,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?
6959,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,"Ten years ago, Your Grace."
6960,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,"From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?"
6961,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,"Shae, Your Grace."
6962,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,"Tell us a story, Shae."
6963,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,"When I was thireen, I-"
6964,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,Your Grace!
6965,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,What news?
6966,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,"The Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls."
6967,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,Where is Joffrey?
6968,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
6969,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,Bring him back inside at once.
6970,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,Your Grace-
6971,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,What?
6972,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,The king's presence is good for morale.
6973,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,Bring him back to his chambers now.
6974,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,Not here?
6975,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?
6976,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,"No, but I-"
6977,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,Now!
6978,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_5,"When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive."
6981,stannis baratheon,2,19,blackwater,STANNIS ON THE HARBOR SHORE_1,Get the ladders up!
6983,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1,Someone bring me a drink.
6984,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1,Fuck the water. Bring me wine.
6985,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1,"Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?"
6986,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1,"Eat shit, dwarf."
6987,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1,You're on the wrong side of the wall.
6988,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1,I lost half my men. The Blackwater's on fire.
6989,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1,"Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight!"
6990,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1,"You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city."
6991,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,COURTYARD BEHIND THE HARBOR WALL_1,Fuck the Kingsguard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king.
7001,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1,"Your Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep."
7002,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1,"If you won't defend your own city, why should they?"
7003,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1,What would you have me do?
7004,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1,Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
7005,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1,What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me?
7006,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1,"She did not say, Your Grace."
7008,joffrey baratheon,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1,"Ser Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my uncle and represent the king on the field of battle."
7009,mandon moore,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1,(nods)
7017,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1,I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!
7020,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1,"Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?"
7022,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_1,There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
7024,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_3,"Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape."
7026,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BEHIND THE WALL_5,Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.
7027,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7,"The battle is lost, Your Grace. Stannis' troops are at the gates. When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart."
7028,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7,Where is my son?
7029,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7,I want to escort him back to the battle.
7030,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7,Why do I care what you want? Bring me-
7031,lancel lannister,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7,Now listen to me-
7032,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7,"Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy..."
7034,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7,You must go. Run to your chamber and bar your door. Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.
7035,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7,Come with me.
7036,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7,I need to say goodbye to someone.
7037,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7,The queen said they'd rape everyone.
7038,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7,No one is raping me.
7039,shae,2,19,blackwater,MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST_7,Go. Run.
7040,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,The lady is starting to panic.
7041,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,What are you doing here?
7042,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,Not here for long. I'm going.
7043,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,Where?
7044,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,"Someplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be."
7045,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,What about the king?
7046,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,He can die just fine on his own.
7047,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,I can take you with me. Take you to Winterfell.
7048,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,I'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home?
7049,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.
7050,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,Look at me. Stannis is a killer. The Lannisters are killers. Your father was a killer. Your brother is a killer. Your sons will be killers someday. The world is built by killers. So you'd better get used to looking at them.
7051,sansa stark,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,You won't hurt me.
7052,sandor clegane,2,19,blackwater,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_1,"No, little bird, I won't hurt you."
7055,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL_5,Attack!
7058,tyrion lannister,2,19,blackwater,BASE OF THE HARBOR WALL_5,"Oh, fuck me."
7059,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1,"Shh! Be calm, my sweet."
7060,tommen baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1,They're still fighting.
7061,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1,No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.
7062,tommen baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1,The Kingswood?
7063,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1,"Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things."
7064,tommen baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1,Like what?
7065,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1,Like stags.
7066,tommen baratheon,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1,Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass.
7067,cersei lannister,2,19,blackwater,THE THRONE ROOM_1,And wolves.

7082,tyrion lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_25,Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive.
7083,podrick payne,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_25,"Yes, my lord."
7084,pycelle,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_25,Would you like something for the pain?
7085,tyrion lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_25,What happened?
7086,pycelle,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_25,The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.
7087,tyrion lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_25,Where am I?
7088,pycelle,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_25,"These are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King."
7089,pycelle,2,20,valar morghulis,Unnamed Scene_25,"Oh, For your trouble."

7094,petyr baelish,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,"You honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons."

7096,joffrey baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,"Your house has come to our aid. The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I. If your family would ask anything of me, ask it, and it shall be yours."
7097,loras tyrell,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,"Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before... She remains innocent. I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our houses."
7098,joffrey baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,"Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?"
7099,margaery tyrell,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,"With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me."
7100,joffrey baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,"I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady. It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another. A king must keep his word."
7101,cersei lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,"Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside."
7103,joffrey baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,"I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow."
7104,pycelle,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,"Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness. I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods."
7105,joffrey baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,"The gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister. You will be my queen and I will love you from this day until my last day."
7106,petyr baelish,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,My lady. My sincerest condolences.
7107,sansa stark,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,They're right. I'm not good enough for him.
7108,petyr baelish,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,"You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well."
7109,sansa stark,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,"But, if he's not marrying me-"
7110,petyr baelish,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,"He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home."
7111,sansa stark,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,King's Landing is my home now.
7112,petyr baelish,2,20,valar morghulis,THRONE ROOM_1,Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.
7113,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,Come in. Make yourself comfortable.
7114,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,"That doesn't look very comfortable. Here, watch me."
7115,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,"No need for that, my dear."
7116,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,You sure? Most men like what they see.
7117,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,I'm not like most men.
7118,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,That's what most men say.
7119,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,(laughs)
7120,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,"If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do."
7121,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.
7122,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,Have we met?
7123,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,You wouldn't remember me if we had?
7124,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,I meet a lot of men.
7125,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them.
7126,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,"You're very kind, my lord. Allow me to return the favor."
7127,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.
7128,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,I know who you are.
7129,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,"And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other."
7130,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,How do you know about that?
7131,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,I thought you said you knew who I was.
7132,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,"What can I do for you, Lord Varys?"
7133,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.
7134,ros,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,I'm afraid of him.
7135,varys,2,20,valar morghulis,BROTHEL_1,"Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks."
7136,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,"You're a virgin, I take it?"
7137,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,Walk.
7138,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,"Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne."
7139,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,One or two tried.
7140,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,"Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough."
7141,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,Not interested.
7142,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
7143,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,"Ah. ""They lay with lions."" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks."
7144,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.
7145,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.
7146,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,What are you doing?
7147,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,Burying them.
7148,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.
7149,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,I think these women would understand if I don't care what you think.
7152,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,Untie me. Now!
7155,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,Traveling a prisoner.
7158,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,If you've quite finished up-
7159,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,"All right, we'll be going."
7161,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,The Starks.
7163,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
7164,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,"No, stealing is a crime."
7165,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.
7167,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,To Riverrun.
7169,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,"Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in."
7171,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,For stealing a pig?
7172,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.
7176,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,Have you been to Ashemark?
7178,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,Then you don't know me.
7180,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,Is it near Ashemark?
7182,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,I've never been there.
7184,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,I hope you gave them quick deaths.
7187,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
7188,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,"If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it."
7191,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,"He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head."
7193,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,Two quick deaths.
7194,jaime lannister,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,Those were Stark men.
7195,brienne of tarth,2,20,valar morghulis,WESTERLANDS SHORE_1,"I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay."

7197,robb stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1,I know that.
7198,catelyn stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1,And you mean to do it anyway?
7199,robb stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1,I love her.
7200,catelyn stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1,I know that seems important to you.
7201,robb stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1,It is important to me.
7202,catelyn stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1,"Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer."
7203,robb stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1,"And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?"
7204,catelyn stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1,Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?
7205,robb stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1,Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
7206,catelyn stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1,"And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing"
7207,robb stark,2,20,valar morghulis,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT._1,My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.
7208,stannis baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1",You said you saw my victory in the flames.
7209,melisandre,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1",l I did. I still see it.
7210,stannis baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1","The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?"
7211,melisandre,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1",The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
7212,stannis baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1",You claimed to speak for a god.
7213,melisandre,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1",Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?
7214,stannis baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1",You talk about war as if you understand it.

7220,stannis baratheon,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1",I murdered my brother.
7221,melisandre,2,20,valar morghulis,"BARATHEON WAR CAMP, NIGHT_1",We murdered him. Share the weight with me.

You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king.

7232,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.
7233,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before
7234,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,"Thank you, wise bald man. Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me."
7235,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,No word from my father?

7240,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,"First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, ""Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. ""We never stood a chance against the man who lives here."""
7241,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.
7242,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,"Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father"
7243,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,"I will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man."
7244,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,"Theon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you."

7246,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,Run. Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have twenty men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run.
7247,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,"There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family."
7248,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch.
7249,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,"Once a man has taken the black, he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven."
7250,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it ten feet past the Winterfell gates.
7251,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck...
7252,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,"The Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there."
7253,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.
7254,luwin,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.
7255,theon greyjoy,2,20,valar morghulis,WINTERFELL_13,"I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing."

7427,grenn,2,20,valar morghulis,THE NORTH_5,Is this goat?
7428,dolorous edd,2,20,valar morghulis,THE NORTH_5,It's moose. People shouldn't live anywhere you need to burn shit to keep warm.
7429,grenn,2,20,valar morghulis,THE NORTH_5,"Well, you see a tree, let me know."
7430,sam,2,20,valar morghulis,THE NORTH_5,"If you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is"
7431,grenn,2,20,valar morghulis,THE NORTH_5,Just bloody kill me.
7432,sam,2,20,valar morghulis,THE NORTH_5,"No, truly. The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better."
7433,dolorous edd,2,20,valar morghulis,THE NORTH_5,The thing about Gilly that you find so interesting is that she said six words to you.
7434,sam,2,20,valar morghulis,THE NORTH_5,And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.
7435,sam,2,20,valar morghulis,THE NORTH_5,It's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back.
7436,grenn,2,20,valar morghulis,THE NORTH_5,Two blasts is wildlings. You're not fighting them alone.

7445,sam,3,21,valar dohaeris,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,Brother?
7446,jeor mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,Did you send the ravens?
7447,jeor mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,"Tarly, look at me. Did you send the ravens?"
7448,sam,3,21,valar dohaeris,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,(Shakes his head.)
7449,jeor mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,NORTH OF THE WALL_11,"That was your job. Your only job. We need to get back to the Wall. It's a long march. We know what's out there, but we have to make it, have to warn them or before winter's done, everyone you've ever known will be dead."
7450,ygritte,3,21,valar dohaeris,BEYOND THE WALL_7,"First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?"
7451,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,BEYOND THE WALL_7,(Nods)
7452,ygritte,3,21,valar dohaeris,BEYOND THE WALL_7,"Well, don't stare too long. They're shy. When they stop being shy, they get angry. And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail."
7460,ygritte,3,21,valar dohaeris,BEYOND THE WALL_7,You're wearing the wrong color.
7461,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,BEYOND THE WALL_7,Mance was a ranger.
7462,ygritte,3,21,valar dohaeris,BEYOND THE WALL_7,"In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free."

7468,ygritte,3,21,valar dohaeris,BEYOND THE WALL_7,"And I'll be free to kill you. Got no respect, this lot. Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul."
7469,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,BEYOND THE WALL_7,What happened to their fathers?
7470,ygritte,3,21,valar dohaeris,BEYOND THE WALL_7,"Some of them were killed by crows like you. Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day. And if he don't..."
7471,tormund,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,I smell a crow.
7472,rattleshirt,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,We killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one.
7473,tormund,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,What do we want with a baby crow?
7474,ygritte,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.
7475,tormund,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.
7476,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
7477,tormund,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?"
7478,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Jon Snow.
7479,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Your Grace.
7480,tormund,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart. ( Laughs. )"
7481,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"Stand, boy. We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall."
7482,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"So, you're Ned Stark's bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us."
7483,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"The girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?"
7484,tormund,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls."
7485,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
7486,tormund,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.
7487,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead.
7488,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,He was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him?
7489,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
7490,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Why?
7491,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,He wants me to lead one day.
7492,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-Beyond-the-Wall."
7493,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"If I'm a traitor, then you are, too."
7494,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?"
7495,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,(Hesitates) I want to be free.
7496,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?"
7497,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
7498,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,You saw what?
7499,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
7500,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?
7501,jon snow,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?"
7502,mance rayder,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,We'll need to find you a new cloak.
7503,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,What if you took off that bit there?
7505,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"Trouble is, I've never had much imagination."
7508,podrick payne,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.
7509,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,I didn't hear that.
7510,podrick payne,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"Apologies, ser."
7511,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Back away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. Then back away some more.
7512,podrick payne,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Lord Tyrion sent me.
7513,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"I will murder you, boy."
7514,podrick payne,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,He said it was a matter of life and death.
7515,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Pod?
7516,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,It's your sister. The queen.
7517,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,What are they doing here?
7518,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?"
7519,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"No, I don't think so."
7520,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?"
7521,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,They stay outside.
7522,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"I'm not afraid of you, little brother."
7523,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Why are you here?
7524,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that."
7525,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
7526,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father."
7527,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me."
7528,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.
7529,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
7530,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,You're meeting Father today?
7531,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,How do you know that?
7532,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?
7533,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came."
7534,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,You're going to make me cry.
7535,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Why do you care what I want from him?
7536,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Because you've slandered me to Father before.
7537,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Slandered? When?
7538,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
7539,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe."
7540,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"I was nine, too."
7541,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"She lost an eye, if I remember correctly."
7542,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again."
7543,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,It's not slander if it's true.
7544,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?
7545,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
7546,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey."
7547,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Any lies in particular?
7548,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are."
7549,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Still makes me more clever than you.
7550,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares."
7551,meryn trant,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Ser Meryn Trant.
7552,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
7553,meryn trant,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,You're no knight.
7554,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Pod.
7555,podrick payne,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.
7556,meryn trant,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more."
7557,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion."
7558,meryn trant,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand."
7559,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me."
7560,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.
7561,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,I've been doing that for a while now.
7562,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Do you grow bored protecting me?
7563,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,I grow poor protecting you.
7564,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch."
7565,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Briefly.
7566,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,I'm sure you filled your pockets.
7567,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,"And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more."
7568,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,I thought we were friends.
7569,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
7570,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,How much?
7571,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Double.
7572,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Double?
7573,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.
7574,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
7575,bronn,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Which means you can afford it.
7576,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,A FREE FOLK TENT_1,Here. Here! Help me!
7578,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight.
7580,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",The one true king of Westeros...  Stannis Baratheon.
7581,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",I thought you were dead. Everyone thought you were dead. And your son?

7583,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",He may have swam ashore as you did.
7584,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","No, the wildfire took him. I saw it."
7585,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","I'm so sorry, my friend. I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world. But, Davos, you were a good father."
7586,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives?"
7587,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
7588,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Will you take me there?
7589,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
7590,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",This war is not over.
7591,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","Not for you, maybe. But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over."
7592,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",We're both sworn to King Stannis.
7593,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",I am sworn to no man. I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory. I delivered the ships.
7594,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Stannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ...
7595,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","He's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive."
7596,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",What?
7597,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned.
7598,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",I'm a pirate.
7599,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",You're a smuggler.
7600,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Servants of darkness. I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
7601,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","Take me back there, please."
7602,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",You cannot turn Stannis against her.
7603,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out."
7604,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","You could try. If you fail, they will burn you. If you succeed, they'll burn you. And you've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend."
7605,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.
7606,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors."

7608,salladhor saan,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck."
7609,roose bolton,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",We should set the siege lines a thousand yards from Harrenhal.
7610,robb stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
7611,roose bolton,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.
7612,robb stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.
7613,rickard karstark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Two hundred Northmen slaughtered like sheep.
7614,roose bolton,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons."
7615,rickard karstark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
7616,roose bolton,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him.
7617,robb stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",A Mallister?
7618,catelyn stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.
7619,robb stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",(to his men) Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
7620,talisa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",She's your mother.
7621,robb stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
7622,qyburn,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",(barely audible) Water. Water.
7623,talisa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",This needs to be cleaned and closed.
7624,robb stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","What's your name, friend?"
7625,qyburn,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Qyburn.
7626,talisa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",You're lucky to be alive.
7627,qyburn,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Lucky?
7628,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",(sighs) The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?
7629,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Am I enjoying it?
7630,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",I was very happy as Hand of the King.
7631,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",(chuckles) Yes. I heard how happy you were.
7632,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",You brought a whore into my bed.
7633,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",It wasn't your bed at the time.
7634,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves."
7635,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
7636,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","What do you want, Tyrion?"
7637,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
7638,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
7639,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start."
7640,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want."
7641,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir."
7642,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",You want Casterly Rock?
7643,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",It is mine by right.
7644,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","(sighs) We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock."
7645,tyrion lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Why?
7646,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."
7647,tywin lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang."
7648,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Dorne. It's going to Dorne.
7649,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Why Dorne?
7650,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
7651,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.
7652,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Don't ruin the game.
7653,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","I told you, I don't want to play."
7654,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",(pointing to another ship) What about that one there?
7655,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",That one? It's going to Volantis.
7656,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Why?
7657,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one."
7658,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
7659,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
7660,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
7661,petyr baelish,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.
7662,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Lord Baelish.
7663,petyr baelish,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
7664,petyr baelish,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.
7665,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
7666,petyr baelish,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
7667,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",I won't tell anyone.
7668,petyr baelish,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",How do I know?
7669,sansa stark,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when."
7670,petyr baelish,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice."
7671,ros,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",You're her handmaiden?
7672,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Yes. And you're his...?
7673,ros,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",I help manage his affairs.
7674,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",He's an important person.
7675,ros,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","So is she. I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle. The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset. We've both done rather well, you and I."
7676,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Yes.
7677,ros,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Given where we started.
7678,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",And where is that?
7679,ros,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Watch out for her.
7680,shae,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",I always do.
7681,ros,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Watch out for her with him.
7682,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",They're growing fast.
7683,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army
7684,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
7685,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people.
7686,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
7687,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",It's too beautiful a day to argue.
7688,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas.
7689,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ..."
7690,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi. You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong. And not before."

7692,stannis baratheon,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",I heard you were dead.
7693,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",Not yet.
7694,stannis baratheon,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace."

7696,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","Your Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight."
7697,stannis baratheon,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",I am fighting.
7698,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",By burning prisoners alive?
7699,melisandre,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?"
7700,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone."
7701,melisandre,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",I'm not your enemy.
7702,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",You are my enemy.
7703,melisandre,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them."
7704,davos seaworth,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",(gasps)
7705,melisandre,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1","Don't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true."

7719,joffrey baratheon,3,21,valar dohaeris,"BLACKWATER BAY, LATER_1",What is she doing? Who gave her permission?
7721,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,NEARBY STREETS_1,Why?
7722,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,NEARBY STREETS_1,Pardon me.
7724,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,NEARBY STREETS_1,I have others.

7731,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD_1,"Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father."
7733,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD_1,And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him.
7734,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD_1,"Was your father a soldier, too?"
7735,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,A SMALL COURTYARD_1,"You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you."
7736,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1","Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them. Directly to me."

7739,joffrey baratheon,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1","Please, sit. Sit. I do apologize, my lady. Small council meetings. At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time?"
7740,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1",(laughs)
7741,joffrey baratheon,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1","That's a lovely gown, my lady."
7742,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1","Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold."
7743,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1","The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace."
7744,joffrey baratheon,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1","Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?"
7745,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1","I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras?"

7747,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1","Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it."
7748,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1",You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
7749,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1",Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
7750,loras tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1",Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.
7751,margaery tyrell,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1",The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
7752,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1","An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life."
7753,joffrey baratheon,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1",My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger.
7754,cersei lannister,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1","You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery."

They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need."
7756,joffrey baratheon,3,21,valar dohaeris,"THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, LATER_1","Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing."

7780,kraznys mo nakloz,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,(speaking Valyrian)
7781,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,Tell the good master there is no need.
7782,kraznys mo nakloz,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,( speaking Valyrian ) She's worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls?
7783,missandei,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,My master points out that men don't need nipples.
7784,kraznys mo nakloz,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,"(speaking Valyrian) Here, I'm done with you."
7785,unsullied,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,(speaking Valyrian) This one is pleased to have served you.
7786,kraznys mo nakloz,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,(speaking Valyrian)
7787,missandei,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,"To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn, and kill it before its mother's eyes. This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them."
7788,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,"You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?"
7789,missandei,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,(speaking Valyrian) She is offended. She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby.
7790,kraznys mo nakloz,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,(speaking Valyrian) What a soft mewling fool this one is. (continues in Valyrian)
7791,missandei,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,"My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother."
7792,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,How many do you have to sell?
7793,missandei,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,(speaking Valyrian)
7794,missandei,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,Eight thousand.
7795,kraznys mo nakloz,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,(speaking Valyrian) Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow.
7796,missandei,3,21,valar dohaeris,THE PATH LEADING TO ASTAPOR_1,Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry. Many other buyers are interested.
7797,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1,Eight thousand dead babies.
7798,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1,The Unsullied are a means to an end.
7799,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1,"Once I own them, these men..."
7800,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1,They're not men. Not anymore.
7801,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1,"Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?"
7802,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1,Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
7803,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1,You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
7804,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1,You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.
7806,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1,(to JORAH) The warlocks.
7807,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1,"I owe you my life, Ser."
7808,barristan selmy,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1,"The honor is mine, my queen."
7809,daenerys targaryen,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1,You know this man?
7810,jorah mormont,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1,(Nods) I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.
7811,barristan selmy,3,21,valar dohaeris,SLAVER'S BAY SHORE_1,"King Robert is dead. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I was sworn to protect your family. I failed them."
7812,jon snow,3,22,dark wings dark words,Unnamed Scene_27,"Don't think too much, Bran."
7813,jon snow,3,22,dark wings dark words,Unnamed Scene_27,Relax your bow arm.
7814,eddard stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,Unnamed Scene_27,(O.S.) And which one of you was a marksman at ten?
7815,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,Unnamed Scene_27,Father?
7816,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,Unnamed Scene_27,"You can't kill it, you know."
7817,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,Unnamed Scene_27,Why not?
7818,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,Unnamed Scene_27,Because the raven is you.
7819,hodor,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,Hodor.
7820,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,"It's all right, Hodor."
7821,hodor,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,Hodor.
7822,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,"Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?"
7823,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,"No, it was the three-eyed raven."
7824,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,He's back.
7825,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,"I tried to kill it, but I couldn't. There was a boy."
7826,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,I don't want to hear about it.
7827,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,But you asked.
7828,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,We've got plenty of worries. We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.
7829,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,I didn't ask for black magic dreams.
7830,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,"I know you didn't, little lord."
7831,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,We need to move.
7832,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,We don't know who might be after us. No one even knows we're alive.
7833,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you?
7834,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,No.
7835,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,"Some good he is, then."
7836,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE NORTH_1,I don't know what other people know and what they don't. I only know the Wall is a long way off.
7837,talisa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1,"My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot. Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds."
7838,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1,Did you ever think you'd marry one?
7839,talisa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1,I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.
7840,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1,Never?
7841,talisa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1,"Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians."
7842,roose bolton,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1,"Pardon me, Your Grace. My queen."
7843,talisa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1,Lord Bolton.
7844,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1,Let me guess which one is the good news.
7845,roose bolton,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL CHAMBER_1,Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.
7846,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9,I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.
7847,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9,We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
7848,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9,Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
7849,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9,Something else?
7850,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9,"By the time Bolton's bastard Ramsay got to Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages."
7851,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9,Have you received any demands?
7852,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9,No.
7853,catelyn stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,HARRENHAL COURTYARD_9,Have you heard anything from Theon at all?
7854,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?
7855,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_1,I want to do this.
7856,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?
7857,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,Yes.
7858,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,So how shall we pass the time?
7859,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,By putting one foot in front of the other.
7860,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,It's going to be a very dull walk.
7861,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.
7862,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,"You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword."
7863,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,"If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman."
7864,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS_1,All the good it's done her.
7865,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
7866,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1","Not your concern, Kingslayer."
7867,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
7868,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",How would you know?
7869,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
7870,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",Move.
7871,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",Were you pledged to Stannis?
7872,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1","Gods, no."
7873,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1","Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal."
7874,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",Shut your mouth.
7875,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1","Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you."
7876,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1","I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king."
7877,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",Sounds like you quite fancied him.
7878,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",I did not fancy him.
7879,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1","Oh, gods, you did."
7880,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1","Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid."
7881,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
7882,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",I'm not interested in foul rumors.
7883,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.
7884,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",Shut your mouth!
7885,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1","I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love."
7887,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",South. You?
7889,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1","No, you really can't."
7891,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",And you.
7892,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",He knows who I am.
7893,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",He doesn't.
7894,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",Maybe you're right.  But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?
7895,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.
7896,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER_1",More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
7897,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Make it tighter here.
7898,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",That's better. It makes you look very strong.
7899,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others.
7901,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Bloody flowers. On the king.
7902,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.
7903,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Tell me what you think of her.
7904,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Who?
7905,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Margaery.
7906,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1","She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century."
7907,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1","It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent."
7908,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1","Yes, she is."
7909,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
7910,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Not to me.
7911,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.
7912,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
7913,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
7914,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.
7915,cersei lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",You need to ask yourself
7916,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",I don't need to do anything.
7917,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1",Better. Much better.
7918,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3",I still don't believe it.
7919,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3",He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
7920,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3",Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
7921,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3",Littlefinger's not in love with me.
7922,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3",Love is not the thing he wants.
7923,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3",He's too old.
7924,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3",They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?
7925,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3",No.
7926,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3","If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me."
7927,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3",Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.
7929,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3",Send him in.
7930,loras tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3",Lady Sansa.
7931,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3",Ser Loras.
7932,loras tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3","My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens. May I escort you to them?"
7933,loras tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa."
7934,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose."
7935,loras tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,Of course I did.
7936,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,(to a maid) It's more your color. You take it.
7938,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,(to LORAS) You're such a dear.
7939,loras tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.
7940,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"Thank you, Ser Loras."
7941,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell."
7942,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"Kiss me, child."
7943,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.
7944,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant."
7945,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king."
7946,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras."
7947,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-
7948,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
7949,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?"
7950,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,Lemon cake's my favorite.

7952,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
7953,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,I haven't had the pleasure.
7954,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey."
7955,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"I-, I-"
7956,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?"

7959,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?"
7960,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.
7961,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,Bring me some cheese.
7963,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.
7964,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you."
7965,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,My father always told the truth.
7966,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,"Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head."
7967,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
7968,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,Go on.
7969,sansa stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.

7973,olenna tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_1,Ah. That's a pity.

7979,robb stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,No.
7980,rickard karstark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_1,Then it's a distraction.

I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us."

8070,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3,Shut up.
8071,gendry,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3,You could have picked Tywin Lannister.

8094,anguy,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3,The fat to your left and the lad beside him.
8095,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3,Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal?

8099,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3,The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
8100,hot pie,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3,I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.
8101,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS WOODS_3,"You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way."

8126,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7",That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
8127,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7",Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
8128,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7",We have to protect her.
8129,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7","We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name."
8130,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7","A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?"
8131,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7","Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you."
8132,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7",You pervert. You want her? This child?
8133,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7",I don't even want to talk about her.
8134,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7",But you are.
8135,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7",Only because you're making me.
8136,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7",I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
8137,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7",This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
8138,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7","Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."
8139,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7","Hmm, yes."
8140,shae,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7",Now do you think I'm cruel?
8141,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7",Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.
8142,tyrion lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_7",Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.
8144,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",Send her in.
8145,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3","You wanted to see me, Your Grace?"
8146,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
8147,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3","That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want."
8148,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.
8149,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.
8150,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?
8151,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3","Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all."
8152,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
8153,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.
8154,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",You failed to do this.
8155,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3","Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace."
8156,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?
8157,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
8158,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",What makes you say this?
8159,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3","Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me."
8160,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3","No, he was a known degenerate."
8161,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3","It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace."
8162,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
8163,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.
8164,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",You are the king.
8165,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",Yes. I am.
8166,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
8167,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
8168,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.
8169,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",The bolt goes here.
8170,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",And then you just aim and-
8171,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3","Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman."
8172,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",It's not unheard of.
8173,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",My father would never let me before-
8174,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it?
8175,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",May I? Please.
8176,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
8177,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",Could you do it? Could you kill something?.
8178,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3","I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?"
8179,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",Yes.
8180,margaery tyrell,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",Would you like to watch me?
8181,joffrey baratheon,3,22,dark wings dark words,"KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_3",Yes.
8182,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,Stop! Stop!
8183,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,Tell us the truth.
8184,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,(screaming) About what?
8185,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,I don't know what you want.
8186,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,I want the truth.
8187,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,What truth?
8188,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,Why'd you take Winterfell?
8189,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,I took it to-I took it-
8190,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,Who gave the orders?
8191,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,No one. I took it on my own.
8192,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,Why?
8193,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,To take the North while it was vulnerable.
8194,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,What were you going to do once you took it?
8195,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,Hold it. Rule it.
8196,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,Good. That's very good.
8197,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,Why did you do that?
8198,torturer,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?
8199,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
8200,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,"(panicking) Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them."
8201,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,What are you doing?
8202,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,Please.
8203,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,"I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off."
8204,ramsay bolton,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,Your sister sent me.
8205,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,Yara?
8206,ramsay bolton,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
8207,theon greyjoy,3,22,dark wings dark words,DUNGEON_3,"No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go."
8208,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,"Rickon, stay with us."
8209,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,It's all right. The wolves will protect him.
8210,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,"You can get inside his head, see through his eyes."
8211,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,Only when I'm asleep.
8212,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.
8213,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-
8214,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,A three-eyed raven?
8215,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,You've seen it?
8216,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?
8217,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,Does it have anything to do with warging?
8218,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,"No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight."
8219,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,Seeing things that haven't happened yet?
8220,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
8221,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,What's he telling him?
8222,meera reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,Why don't you ask?
8223,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,"Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?"
8224,meera reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,Where's the shame in that?
8225,osha,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
8226,meera reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.
8227,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,"When my father died, I dreamt it."
8228,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.
8229,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,"You have the sight, too?"
8230,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,"(Nods) When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry."
8231,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.
8232,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,Yeah.
8233,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,He saved my father's life during the rebellion.
8234,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,"Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too."
8235,bran stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,What else have you seen?
8236,jojen reed,3,22,dark wings dark words,THE NORTH_7,Only one thing that matters-you.
8238,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,I don't drink ale.
8239,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.
8241,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,"You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-"
8242,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,We're not children.
8243,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,"How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?"
8244,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
8245,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,"A smith, eh? Where'd you train?"
8246,gendry,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
8247,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.
8248,gendry,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,That's because he's twice as good.
8249,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,Aha! A smith and a salesman.
8250,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,Gendry stole us weapons.
8251,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,"Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see."
8252,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
8253,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,My brothers taught me.
8255,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,To your brothers!
8256,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,You can finish your meals before you go. It may be awhile before you see another.
8257,arya stark,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,You'll free us?
8258,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,I gave you my word.
8259,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,"But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-"
8260,anguy,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,"Hey, hey."
8261,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,Now that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
8262,anguy,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
8263,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,Poor man. You have my sympathy.
8264,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,"Aha, not a man at all. A Hound!"
8265,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,"So good to see you again, Clegane."
8266,sandor clegane,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,Thoros? The fuck you doing here?
8267,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.
8268,thoros,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,"A pretty prize, lads."
8270,sandor clegane,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,Girl.
8271,sandor clegane,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS TAVERN_1,(to Thoros) What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?
8272,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_5,It's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
8273,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_5,"Silence, Kingslayer."
8274,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_5,"Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river."
8275,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_5,Good luck.
8276,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS_5,It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?
8277,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.
8278,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,Be quick about it.
8279,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,I need to rest.
8280,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,Get up.
8281,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,"I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?"
8282,brienne of tarth,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,Get up now.
8283,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,"Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year."
8284,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,This heel is ruined. There's no way-
8285,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
8286,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.
8287,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.
8288,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,"Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you."
8289,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,"You're good. Graceless, but good."
8290,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,"See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there."
8291,locke,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,"Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman."
8292,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.
8293,locke,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,You sure he's the one?
8295,locke,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,Give the man his silver.
8296,jaime lannister,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
8297,locke,3,22,dark wings dark words,RIVERLANDS BRIDGE_1,"Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours."

8309,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1","I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill."
8310,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1",We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.
8311,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1",Willem and Martyn Lannister are fourteen years old.
8312,brynden tully (blackfish),3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1","Martyn is fifteen, I believe."
8313,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1",Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?
8314,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1",No.
8315,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1",Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?
8316,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1",No.
8317,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1",How many men did you lose?
8318,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1","But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-"
8319,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1",We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
8320,edmure tully,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1",I'm sorry. I didn't know.
8321,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1",You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
8322,brynden tully (blackfish),3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1",We seem to be running short of patience here.
8323,robb stark,3,23,walk of punishment,"RIVERRUN WAR ROOM, LATER_1",You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
8324,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1",Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
8325,tywin lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1",What news of Jaime?
8326,tywin lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1","Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?"
8327,varys,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1","We are trying, my lord."
8328,tywin lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1","Try harder. What do we have, then?"
8329,varys,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1","Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name."
8330,tywin lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1","Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn."
8331,petyr baelish,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1","For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord.  Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me."
8332,pycelle,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1",A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
8333,petyr baelish,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1",Titles do seem to breed titles.
8334,tywin lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1",You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
8335,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1","Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended."
8336,tywin lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1",Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
8337,cersei lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1",(chuckles)
8338,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1",Master of Coin?
8339,tywin lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1",It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
8340,tyrion lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1","I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it."
8341,cersei lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1",I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
8342,pycelle,3,23,walk of punishment,"KING'S LANDING, SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1","Hear, hear."
8344,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,"I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us."
8345,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,You were armed when we were taken.
8346,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
8347,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,"All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable."
8348,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.
8349,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.
8350,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,You were not beating me.
8351,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
8352,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,"When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist."
8353,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,Would I?
8354,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,They'll knock your teeth out.
8355,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,You think I care about my teeth?
8356,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,"No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?"
8357,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,What does it matter?
8358,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.
8359,brienne of tarth,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,"If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted?"
8360,jaime lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS WOODS_5,"If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods."
8361,gendry,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,"If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new."
8362,thoros,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
8363,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
8364,thoros,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,"You're not our prisoner, little lady."
8365,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,What am I?
8366,thoros,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,Our guest. No one's put any chains on you.
8367,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,"So I can walk away, then?"
8368,thoros,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter. You're lucky we found you.
8369,sandor clegane,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,"You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?"
8370,anguy,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,Better than anyone you've ever met.
8371,sandor clegane,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,A coward's weapon. I like to fight up close. I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.
8372,anguy,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,Why? So you can kiss him?
8373,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,You remember the last time you were here?
8374,sandor clegane,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,Looks like every other shit inn on the road.
8375,anguy,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,"Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more."
8376,anguy,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,(sarcastically) Watch your head. Off we go.
8378,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,What are you doing? We're about to leave.
8379,hot pie,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,I'm staying.
8380,gendry,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,You're what?
8381,hot pie,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,"I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better. Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him. Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king. I'm not a Stark of ""Winterhell""."
8382,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,Winterfell.
8383,hot pie,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,You sure?
8384,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,I'm sure.
8385,hot pie,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,"Well, I made you something."
8386,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,What is it?
8387,hot pie,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,It's a wolf.
8388,gendry,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,"Yes, it is."
8389,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,That's the tail?
8390,hot pie,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,Yeah.
8391,gendry,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,"Well, be safe."
8392,hot pie,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,"Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed."
8393,gendry,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,You don't burn your fingers.
8394,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,"Good-bye, Hot Pie."
8395,hot pie,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,"Good-bye, Arry."
8397,arya stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERLANDS_7,"Hey, Hot Pie. It's really good."
8398,catelyn stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1,A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.
8399,brynden tully (blackfish),3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1,"It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening."
8400,catelyn stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1,"I've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words-"
8401,brynden tully (blackfish),3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1,Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox. I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience.
8402,catelyn stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1,I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?
8403,brynden tully (blackfish),3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1,"After thirty years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it. He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish. He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with. I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name."
8404,catelyn stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1,"Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say. 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again."
8405,brynden tully (blackfish),3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1,You mustn't think it. We don't know the truth. They could be in hiding. Robb believes they're alive. And he must go on believing. He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail. And you must remain strong for him.
8406,catelyn stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN GREAT HALL_1,(sighs)
8407,martyn lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1,You're Robb Stark's wife.
8408,talisa stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1,Hold still.
8409,martyn lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1,Is it true what they say about him?
8410,talisa stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1,I don't know. What do they say about him?
8411,martyn lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1,That he can turn into a wolf at night.
8412,talisa stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1,True.
8413,martyn lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1,And he eats the flesh of his enemies.
8414,talisa stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1,"True. You're a Lannister, aren't you?"
8415,martyn lannister,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1,Martyn Lannister.
8416,talisa stark,3,23,walk of punishment,RIVERRUN DUNGEON_1,"Martyn Lannister. You've nothing to fear. My husband doesn't eat children. Unless it's a full moon. It's not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear."
8417,mance rayder,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,Always the artists.
8418,jon snow,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,It's only horses. No men.
8419,ygritte,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,You said there was dead crows.
8420,orell,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,There was.
8421,mance rayder,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,How many men were here?
8422,jon snow,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,About three hundred.
8423,mance rayder,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,And you know what those men are now?
8424,jon snow,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,(nods)
8425,mance rayder,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,We're all the same to them - meat for their army.
8426,jon snow,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,Do you think anyone got away?
8427,mance rayder,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,"It's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont. But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north. And he lost. His best fighting men are dead. And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home. Tormund. Climb the Wall. Take Orell and twenty good men. And take this one. He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us. And if he's useful, good. If not throw him off the Wall. See if crows can fly."
8428,tormund,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,"We're finally going to war, old friend?"
8429,mance rayder,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,"Hide near Castle Black. When I give the signal, hit them in the night. They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side."
8430,tormund,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,We'll meet again.
8431,mance rayder,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,Aye. If you do your job. Ah.
8432,orell,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,How will we see your signal?
8433,mance rayder,3,23,walk of punishment,NORTH OF THE WALL_17,"Send your eagle above the Wall every night. When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen."
8434,sam,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_3",Ghost?
8435,craster,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_3",What have we here? Frozen crows?
8436,jeor mormont,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_3",We've come a long way.
8437,craster,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_3",Smaller flock than you went north with.
8438,jeor mormont,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_3",We can talk inside.
8439,craster,3,23,walk of punishment,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_3","Oh, can we?"
8442,craster,3,23,walk of punishment,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,Keep your eyes where they belong. They're not for you.
8443,karl tanner,3,23,walk of punishment,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
8444,craster,3,23,walk of punishment,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,"Aye, pig's got value to me. You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in. I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man."
8445,jeor mormont,3,23,walk of punishment,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,You are a godly man?
8446,craster,3,23,walk of punishment,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,"I am. I got no fear of what's out there. When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you. The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods. The real gods."
8447,craster,3,23,walk of punishment,CRASTER'S KEEP_1,"Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist. Women. That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight. Barely a grunt. (Pointing to SAM) And she's almost as fat as this one here.  Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go. Well, look at him. He's a walking feast."

8457,ramsay bolton,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,Ride east. Follow the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you.
8458,theon greyjoy,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.

8462,stannis baratheon,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,You refuse to tell me where you're going?
8463,melisandre,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,I don't know yet. The fires will show me.
8464,stannis baratheon,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,How long will you be gone?
8465,melisandre,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,I don't know.
8466,stannis baratheon,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,You're abandoning me.
8467,melisandre,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,I will never abandon you. You are the Son of Fire.  I am sworn to serve you.
8468,stannis baratheon,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,Then serve me.
8469,melisandre,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,"When I return, you will understand."
8470,stannis baratheon,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son.
8471,melisandre,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,I cannot.
8472,stannis baratheon,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,Why?
8473,melisandre,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,You don't have the strength. It would kill you.
8474,stannis baratheon,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.
8475,stannis baratheon,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,(whispering) I want you.
8476,melisandre,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,"Your fires burn low, my king."
8477,melisandre,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,There is another way. A better way.
8478,stannis baratheon,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,You told me your magic requires a king's blood.
8479,melisandre,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,Yes.
8480,stannis baratheon,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,I'm the one true king.
8481,melisandre,3,23,walk of punishment,OUTSIDE_1,"You are. But there are others with your blood in their veins. You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices. The Lord of Light demands it."

There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."

8709,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,I hope we might speak. In confidence.
8710,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,"Oh, always in confidence."
8711,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?
8712,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,"Oh, no. It's a wonderful time."
8713,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-
8714,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,End your life?
8715,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,"I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof."
8716,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,Proof? Will there be a trial?
8717,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,I need to know.
8718,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,"I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?"
8719,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,I don't know. Do I?
8720,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,"As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."
8721,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,"Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-"
8722,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,You do not possess at the moment.
8723,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,"But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special."
8724,tyrion lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,The sorcerer.
8725,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_17,"Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it."
8726,grenn,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,"When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling."
8727,dolorous edd,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,Or the shit.
8728,grenn,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,"They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it."
8729,dolorous edd,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that.
8730,grenn,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,"But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling."
8731,dolorous edd,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,"Oh, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day."
8732,rast,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,We need to get out of here.
8733,grenn,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,"When the Lord Commander says we go, we go."
8734,rast,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us?
8735,dolorous edd,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,He had no way of knowing.
8736,rast,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,We do now. We know what's out there.
8737,grenn,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,Craster's been out here surviving.
8738,rast,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?
8739,dolorous edd,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,We're like the sons he never had.
8740,rast,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_3,"Mormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves."

8748,gilly,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5,Why?
8749,gilly,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5,Here.
8750,sam,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5,Gilly.
8751,gilly,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5,You said to hold it for you until you came back. You're back.
8752,sam,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5,I wanted you to have it.
8753,gilly,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5,I don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you?
8754,gilly,3,24,and now his watch is ended,CRASTER'S KEEP_5,I don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.

8767,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,"No larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was-"
8768,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,Extraordinary.
8769,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men.
8770,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?

8772,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,What did he do to them?
8773,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,"I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive."
8774,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,So what did they say?
8775,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,They said it was hard to describe.
8776,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
8777,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
8778,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,"Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?"
8779,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,"He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest."
8780,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,What makes you say so?
8781,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,His shipboard inventory.
8782,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
8783,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,Former profession.
8784,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
8785,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
8786,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
8787,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,"He's not interested in them, my lord."
8788,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,How do you know?
8789,ros,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,Because I'm one of his girls.
8790,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING_19,Prodigies in odd places indeed.
8791,joffrey baratheon,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1","Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon. It ate her while her son watched. What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there."

8793,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1",There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.
8794,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1",There aren't more than seven hundred people of any importance.

8810,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_1",A fairly predictable tragedy. Hunting and drinking don't mix.

8851,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1",What did he tell you to do?
8852,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1",Raid fishing villages. He didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark. Ha. I could never be a Stark. Robb Stark always reminded me of that.
8853,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1",He lorded it over you?
8854,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1",Didn't have to. All he had to do was be. Be who he was born to be. His life fit him better than his clothes. How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? He's the King in the North.
8855,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1","And me my father gave me a choice and I made it. I could never be a Stark. But ironborn, that's what I was born to be. I paid the iron price for Winterfell. I murdered those boys."
8856,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1",The Stark boys?
8857,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1",Never found them. Just some poor orphans living with a farmer. I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud.
8858,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1",Maybe it's not too late.
8859,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1",It is. My real father lost his head at King's Landing. I made a choice and I chose wrong. And now I've burned everything down.
8860,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1","Not everything, my lord. She's up here."
8861,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1",Yara.
8862,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1",Shh. Wait.
8863,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1",I brought him back. He killed the others.
8864,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1","What? No, I didn't."
8865,theon greyjoy,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1","You can't! No, please stop! No!"
8866,ramsay bolton,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"NORTHERN WOODS, LATER_1",Put him back where he belongs.
8867,brienne of tarth,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1",Eat. What are you doing?
8868,jaime lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1",I'm dying.
8869,brienne of tarth,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1",You can't die. You need to live to take revenge.
8870,jaime lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1",I don't care about revenge.
8871,brienne of tarth,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1",You coward. A little misfortune and you're giving up.
8872,jaime lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1",Misfor- misfortune?
8873,brienne of tarth,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1",You lost your hand.
8874,jaime lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1",My sword hand. I was that hand.
8875,brienne of tarth,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1",You have a taste- one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit. You sound like a bloody woman.
8876,brienne of tarth,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"THE RIVERLANDS, NIGHT_1",I know what you did for me. You told them Tarth was full of sapphires. It's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water. You knew that. Why did you help me?
8877,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",You wanted to speak to me?
8878,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","Yes, about Jaime."
8879,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",What about him?
8880,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back.
8881,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner, what did I do in response?"
8882,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",You started a war.
8883,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?"
8884,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Whatever you can.
8885,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Whatever I can.
8886,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",You're still here.
8887,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Yes.
8888,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Why?
8889,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me. Years and years of lectures on family and legacy- the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations- did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them? Living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children?"
8890,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",All right. Contribute.
8891,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",The Tyrells are a problem.
8892,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1","The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon. The Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives."
8893,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Margaery has her claws in Joffrey. She knows how to manipulate him.
8894,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him. I don't distrust you because you're a woman. I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are. You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.
8895,cersei lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.
8896,tywin lannister,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_1",I will.
8898,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3,"Another golden rose. How original. I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses. I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear. 'Growing strong.' Ha! The dullest words of any house. 'Winter is coming!' Now that's memorable. 'We do not sow.' Strong. Strong. Those are houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts. But a golden rose growing strong- ha, that strikes fear in the heart."
8899,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3,"Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along now. Grow strong."
8900,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3,My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence.
8901,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3,"The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?"
8902,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3,"A little obvious, perhaps."
8903,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3,"Oh, no, please. Seduce away. It's been so long. Though I rather think it's all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers. But you've come mincing all this way for something. So?"
8904,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3,Might I sit?
8905,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3,"No. Come, I've heard you're such a clever man. I'm curious why you've sought me out."
8906,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3,You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.
8907,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3,Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn't I take an interest? She's an interesting girl.
8908,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3,Is she?
8909,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3,"No, not particularly. But she's had an interesting childhood."
8910,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3,"She has, sadly. Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then. I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being."
8911,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING GARDENS_3,"Come, come. You surrender rather easily. Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too."
8912,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still.
8913,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,Which is Sansa Stark?
8914,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father.
8915,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,"Yes. Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?"
8916,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter.
8917,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,How?
8918,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.
8919,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.
8920,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.
8921,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.
8922,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,"Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him."
8923,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,And why have you come to me with this matter?
8924,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,"Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army?"
8925,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,(laughs)
8926,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,"Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North."
8927,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,"And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket."
8928,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?
8929,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,You must despise him. You're working so hard to undermine him.
8930,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,"Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes."
8931,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,"You are a clever man, Lord Varys."
8932,varys,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution.
8933,olenna tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS_1,"One doesn't need to be clever for that. It's all rather obvious, isn't it?"
8934,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,Ahem. I didn't mean to disturb you.
8935,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,You haven't.
8936,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,"(to the guards) We'd like some privacy, please. If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep. Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names, I'll ask the king to speak with you himself."
8937,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,What did you pray for?
8938,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,I can't tell you.
8939,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,"Why not? I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning. Let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter. Boring and traditional, I'm afraid. And you?"
8940,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,"I'm sorry, I just can't."
8941,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,"My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me. Pig-face, she called me."
8942,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,Pig-face? That's ridiculous.
8943,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,"I think it had something to do with my nose. Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink."
8944,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,(laughs)
8945,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,"So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease. A week after that, she came down with porridge plague."
8946,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,Porridge plague?
8947,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,You don't have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony.
8948,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,But that's awful.
8949,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,"(nods, laughs)"
8950,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,You're- I believed you! Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.
8951,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,"Don't say that. No, you're not."
8952,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,So what happened to Alanna?
8953,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,"Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. It's all terribly frustrating."
8954,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,I'm sure she's jealous of you now. You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.
8955,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,"I want us to be friends, good friends."
8956,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,That would make me very happy.
8957,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,You must see Highgarden. You'd love it there. I know you would. We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon. You should see the costumes. People work on them for months.
8958,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,I- I don't think the queen would let me leave King's Landing.
8959,margaery tyrell,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,"The Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen. And if you were to marry Loras... Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it? We would be sisters, you and I. Would you like that?"
8960,sansa stark,3,24,and now his watch is ended,KING'S LANDING SHORELINE_1,(nods)
8961,jeor mormont,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5","His name was Bannen. He was a good man, a good ranger. He came to us from- where did he come from?"
8962,dolorous edd,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5",Down White Harbor way.
8963,jeor mormont,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5","He came to us from White Harbor. Never failed in his duty. He kept his vows the best he could. He rode far, fought fiercely. We shall never see his like again."

8966,grenn,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5",Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.
8967,rast,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5",It wasn't his foot that killed him. That bastard Craster starved him to death.

8971,rast,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5","The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow. He's a bloody wildling is all he is."
8972,eddison tollett,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_5",Never knew Bannen could smell so good.
8973,craster,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1","You have one son, don't you, Mormont? I had my ninety-ninth. You ever meet a man with ninety-nine sons?"

8981,jeor mormont,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1",Wait outside.

8986,karl tanner,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1",I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.
8987,jeor mormont,3,24,and now his watch is ended,"CRASTER'S KEEP, LATER_1",I told you to wait outside.

9162,roose bolton,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHAL_7,Find suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later.
9163,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHAL_7,Lord Bolton.
9164,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHAL_7,Is there word from the capital?
9165,roose bolton,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHAL_7,You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.
9166,roose bolton,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHAL_7,Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.
9167,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1",Will I die?
9168,qyburn,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1",No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
9169,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1",Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?
9170,qyburn,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1","The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow."
9171,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1",I don't need my right hand to kill you.
9172,qyburn,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1",I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine.
9173,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1",Mmm.
9174,qyburn,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1","With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy."
9175,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1",No milk of the poppy.
9176,qyburn,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1",There will be pain.
9177,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1",I'll scream.
9178,qyburn,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1",Quite a bit of pain.
9179,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"HARRENHAL, QYBURN'S WORKSPACE_1",I'll scream loudly.
9180,cersei lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21,Lord Baelish.
9181,petyr baelish,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21,Your Grace.
9182,cersei lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21,I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
9183,petyr baelish,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21,"Of course, Your Grace."
9184,cersei lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21,I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
9185,petyr baelish,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21,I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
9186,cersei lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21,My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
9187,petyr baelish,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21,"Myself, I often find them a hindrance."
9188,cersei lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21,"And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital."
9189,petyr baelish,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21,I shall do my best.
9190,cersei lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21,Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
9191,petyr baelish,3,25,kissed by fire,KING'S LANDING_21,I assure you that it will.
9192,olenna tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9","Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern."
9193,podrick payne,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9","Pardon, my lady."
9194,olenna tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?
9195,tyrion lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9","Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters."
9196,olenna tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
9197,tyrion lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
9198,olenna tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",Naturally.
9199,tyrion lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
9200,olenna tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
9201,tyrion lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",I understand that.
9202,olenna tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",Good.
9203,tyrion lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9","But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense."
9204,olenna tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",And?
9205,tyrion lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9","And we're at war, Lady Olenna."
9206,olenna tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9","Oh, I'd nearly forgotten."
9207,tyrion lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9","Yes, and maintaining supply lines-"
9208,olenna tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9","I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them."
9209,tyrion lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
9210,olenna tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9","As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?"
9211,tyrion lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",I would.
9212,olenna tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
9213,tyrion lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",(nods)
9214,olenna tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9","I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?"
9215,tyrion lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",My lady-
9216,olenna tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9","Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?"
9217,tyrion lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",Quite sufficient. Thank you.
9218,olenna tyrell,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9","Very good, then. That's settled. Good day."
9219,tyrion lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS_9",Give me that.
9220,arya stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",What are you doing?
9221,gendry,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",Just mending Lord Beric's armor.
9222,arya stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",Why?
9223,gendry,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.
9224,arya stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1","Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet."
9225,gendry,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
9226,arya stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",You don't have to do this.
9227,gendry,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",I want to. They need good men.
9228,arya stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1","Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you-"
9229,gendry,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1","What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving."
9230,arya stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
9231,gendry,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1","He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family."
9232,arya stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",I can be your family.
9233,gendry,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERLANDS, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",You wouldn't be my family. You'd be 'my lady'.
9234,martyn lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_3,Willem. Willem!
9235,willem,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_3,Is this a rescue?
9236,rickard karstark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_3,Lannister filth! Take him!
9237,martyn lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_3,"Please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire. Please-"
9238,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,Bring them in.
9239,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
9240,rickard karstark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,"Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance."
9241,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-
9242,rickard karstark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.
9243,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,They were boys! Look at them.
9244,rickard karstark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.
9245,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
9246,rickard karstark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,"It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?"
9247,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,Leave him.
9248,rickard karstark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
9249,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
9251,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.
9253,edmure tully,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,Word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews. The Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it.
9254,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
9255,edmure tully,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,It wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
9256,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,"I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die."
9257,catelyn stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.
9258,talisa stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,"Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you."
9259,robb stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.
9260,talisa stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,And more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it.
9261,catelyn stark,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.
9262,edmure tully,3,25,kissed by fire,RIVERRUN_5,"A hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed."
9263,rickard karstark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN YARDS, LATER_1","The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin- Stark and Karstark."

9265,rickard karstark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN YARDS, LATER_1",I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.

9269,arya stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?
9270,thoros,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.
9271,arya stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
9272,thoros,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",Don't think of it that way.
9273,arya stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",But it is that way.
9274,thoros,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",It is. And it isn't.
9275,arya stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",More is than isn't.
9276,thoros,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1","Beric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether."

9281,beric dondarrion,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",You're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged.
9282,arya stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",I thought he killed you.
9283,beric dondarrion,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",He did.
9284,arya stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",But how?
9285,beric dondarrion,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",Thoros how many times have you brought me back?
9286,thoros,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
9287,beric dondarrion,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",How many times?
9288,thoros,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1","Five, I think. No, this makes six."
9289,beric dondarrion,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",Six.
9290,thoros,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",There was the first time- the Mountain. Show her. Lance right through the chest.
9291,beric dondarrion,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",Then I was stabbed in the belly.
9292,thoros,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",Then it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side.
9293,beric dondarrion,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
9294,thoros,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.
9295,thoros,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",And the Hound makes six.
9296,beric dondarrion,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.
9297,thoros,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1","You'd think you'd learn. It's not getting any easier, you know."
9298,beric dondarrion,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1","I know. Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away."
9299,arya stark,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1",Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.
9300,thoros,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1","I don't think it works that way, child."
9301,beric dondarrion,3,25,kissed by fire,"RIVERRUN, THE CAVERNS OF THE BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS_1","He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere. I would never wish my life upon him."

9306,stannis baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7,I meant to come sooner. The battle-

9308,stannis baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7,"Yes, of course."
9309,selyse baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7,You mustn't despair. Your claim is true. You will be victorious.
9310,stannis baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7,I believed that once.
9311,selyse baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7,You are the one god's champion and the finest man I've ever known.
9312,stannis baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7,Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.
9313,selyse baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7,No.
9314,stannis baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7,I've wronged you. I have shamed you.
9315,selyse baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7,You're doing god's work.
9316,stannis baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7,You don't understand. The Red Woman- the Lady Melisandre-
9317,selyse baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7,"I know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy."
9318,selyse baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE_7,"Oh, my sweet boys. Petyr, Tommard, Edric. I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us. She gave you a son. I gave you - nothing."

9329,stannis baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1,No.
9330,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1,Did the Onion Knight come back with you?
9331,stannis baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1,He did. He fought bravely.
9332,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1,He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.
9333,stannis baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1,"He won't be visiting, child."
9334,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1,Why not? He's my friend. Look.
9335,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,INSIDE SHIREEN'S CHAMBERS_1,He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.

9339,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.
9340,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,Now get out.
9341,brienne of tarth,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,There's another tub.
9342,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,"This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub."
9343,brienne of tarth,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,Why should I care how you die?
9344,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,"You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him."
9345,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-
9346,brienne of tarth,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,Don't you mock me.
9347,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.
9348,brienne of tarth,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,You need trust to have a truce.
9349,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,I trust you.
9350,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?
9351,brienne of tarth,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,Of course.
9352,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,"The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?"
9353,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,"First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."
9354,brienne of tarth,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
9355,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
9356,brienne of tarth,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,Help! Help! The Kingslayer!
9357,jaime lannister,3,25,kissed by fire,HARRENHALL BATHING CHAMBER_1,Jaime. My name is Jaime.

9362,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
9363,davos seaworth,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew-
9364,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,he said you Were a traitor. Are you?
9365,davos seaworth,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,"I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price."
9366,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.
9367,davos seaworth,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,Aye. So they did.
9368,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more.
9369,davos seaworth,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,"Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me."
9370,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,Take it. I have more.
9371,davos seaworth,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,"My lady, I can't read the words."
9372,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,You can't?

9374,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.
9375,davos seaworth,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,No. No. No.
9376,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,It's easy. It'll be fun.
9377,davos seaworth,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,Go. We can't.
9378,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,"Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?"
9379,davos seaworth,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,(laughs) I wouldn't know where to start.
9380,shireen baratheon,3,25,kissed by fire,DRAGONSTONE DUNGEON_1,"At the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is 'An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.'"

9383,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1","The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his."
9384,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle?
9385,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1","Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss."

9387,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",In full plate metal for sixteen hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
9388,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1","Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings."
9389,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1",You swore an oath.
9390,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_1","Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?"

9404,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3",Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.

9409,barristan selmy,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3",He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.

9416,jorah mormont,3,25,kissed by fire,"SLAVER'S BAY, RIVER_3",It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.

9651,thoros,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3","We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold."
9652,gendry,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3",You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.
9653,melisandre,3,26,the climb,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_3",You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.

9662,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",Wa-? Wa-? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.

9664,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?
9665,theon greyjoy,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",Please.
9666,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",Please is not a body part.
9667,theon greyjoy,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1","I'll tell you everything, please."
9668,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1","But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you."
9669,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1","Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that."

If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger."
9672,theon greyjoy,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1","If I win, you'll let me go?"
9673,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1","If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."

9675,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?
9676,theon greyjoy,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",The North.

9678,theon greyjoy,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",Deepwood Motte.
9679,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",Terrible guess.
9680,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1","Now, where?"
9681,theon greyjoy,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",Last Hearth.
9682,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
9683,theon greyjoy,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",Karhold!
9684,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
9685,theon greyjoy,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",No. It was just a guess.
9686,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1","Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?"
9687,theon greyjoy,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",Torrhen Karstark.
9688,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.
9689,theon greyjoy,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.

9692,theon greyjoy,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.
9693,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",Yes. You win.
9694,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1","Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar."
9695,theon greyjoy,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",(screams louder than before)
9696,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",I'm afraid I am.

9701,ramsay bolton,3,26,the climb,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_1",I win.
9702,robb stark,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.
9703,walder rivers,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1","The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come."
9704,lothar frey,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
9705,robb stark,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.
9706,walder rivers,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1","As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands."
9707,edmure tully,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",I don't think that's-
9708,robb stark,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
9709,walder rivers,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",And there's something else.
9710,robb stark,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
9711,walder rivers,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1","Not what, whom."
9712,edmure tully,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",What?
9713,edmure tully,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",(chuckles) No.
9714,lothar frey,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters- Roslin.
9715,edmure tully,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",How old is she?
9716,lothar frey,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",Nineteen.
9717,edmure tully,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",Could I see her first?
9718,walder rivers,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
9719,brynden tully (blackfish),3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?
9720,lothar frey,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
9721,walder rivers,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
9722,robb stark,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
9723,edmure tully,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1","Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord."
9724,robb stark,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
9725,edmure tully,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",I didn't wound him. My answer is no.
9726,brynden tully (blackfish),3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-
9727,edmure tully,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.
9728,brynden tully (blackfish),3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
9729,robb stark,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1","It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead."
9730,edmure tully,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1","He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing."
9731,catelyn stark,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
9732,robb stark,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
9733,brynden tully (blackfish),3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",You recall that heroic engagement?
9734,edmure tully,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",I had something less permanent in mind.
9735,robb stark,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1","I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost."
9736,edmure tully,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1",I'll marry her.
9737,robb stark,3,26,the climb,"RIVERRUN, GREAT HALL_1","You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it."
9738,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1",I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
9739,brienne of tarth,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1","Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing."
9740,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1","When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason."
9741,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1",I should send you back to Robb Stark.
9742,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1","You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?"
9743,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1",Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.
9744,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1",We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
9745,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1",You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
9746,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1","It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it."
9747,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1",King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.
9748,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1",He'll make time for you.
9749,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1","As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming."
9750,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1",Shall we drink on it?
9751,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1",I don't partake.
9752,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1",You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
9753,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1","Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident."
9754,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1","Oh, she won't be going with you."
9755,brienne of tarth,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1",I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-
9756,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1",You are charged with abetting treason.
9757,jaime lannister,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1",I'm afraid I must insist.
9758,roose bolton,3,26,the climb,"HARRENHALL, DINING ROOM_1",You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
9759,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",Impossible.
9760,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",Why?
9761,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-
9762,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3","Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king."
9763,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",Old.
9764,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",Old?
9765,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3","Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely."
9766,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3","The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?"
9767,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3","Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through."
9768,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
9769,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3","Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?"
9770,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",Of course.
9771,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",And you never-
9772,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",No.
9773,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",Not once? Not in any way?
9774,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",Never.
9775,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3","I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets."
9776,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
9777,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3","I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out."
9778,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
9779,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3","Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation."
9780,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
9781,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3","As an authority on myself, I must disagree."
9782,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3","Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt."
9783,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3","And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take."
9784,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
9785,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3","If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children."
9786,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",Oh
9787,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
9788,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
9789,tywin lannister,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3","I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?"
9790,olenna tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, TYWIN'S CHAMBERS_3",It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.

9805,loras tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3","Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so"
9806,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",I'm very happy about
9807,loras tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3","Uh, yes. I-I am as well."
9808,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",I feel like I'm in a dream.
9809,loras tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3","Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?"
9810,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3",No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
9811,loras tyrell,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_3","It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is."
9812,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
9813,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,We can have them both killed.
9814,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
9815,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
9816,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,On a boat you built.
9817,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
9818,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
9819,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,"I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate."
9820,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?

But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot."
9822,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,What do you want me to say?
9823,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
9824,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
9825,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
9826,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,"Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands."
9827,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,"You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels."
9828,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,"When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere."
9829,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,"Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
9830,cersei lannister,3,26,the climb,GARDENS OVERLOOK_1,Who's going to tell her?
9831,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,Do you think people will like it?
9832,shae,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,I don't think they will even notice it.
9833,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,"You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade."
9834,shae,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,I'm sure he does.
9835,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,Will they let me invite my family?
9836,shae,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,They haven't asked my opinion.
9837,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,But do you think they will?
9838,shae,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,No.
9840,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,"I beg your pardon, my lady."
9841,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,"Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding."
9842,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,"Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
9843,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,Of course.
9844,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,"Alone, if I may."
9845,shae,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,Why do you need to speak to her alone?
9846,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,"Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
9847,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
9848,sansa stark,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,"It's all right, really."
9849,tyrion lannister,3,26,the climb,SANSA'S CHAMBERS_3,How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.

9851,petyr baelish,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3,There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.
9852,varys,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3,"Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice."
9853,petyr baelish,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3,"Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want."
9854,varys,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3,"Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?"
9855,petyr baelish,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3,"You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience."
9856,varys,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3,I did what I did for the good of the realm.
9857,petyr baelish,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3,The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
9858,varys,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3,But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
9859,petyr baelish,3,26,the climb,THRONE ROOM_3,Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
9860,petyr baelish,3,26,the climb,JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS_1,(voice over) Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
9861,petyr baelish,3,26,the climb,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_5","(voice over) And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is."

9863,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,"About a week, I think."
9864,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,You think? You don't know?
9865,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,"When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad."
9866,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
9867,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,"Most of the time, yes."
9868,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,How do the men holding the banners fight?
9869,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,"They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil."
9870,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,"And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?"
9871,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
9872,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,So what good are they?
9873,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,They help the men march.
9874,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,How?
9875,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,"Well, it's- it's the rhythm."
9876,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,"Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming."
9877,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,"No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."

9879,orell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,"She's right, you don't."
9880,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
9881,orell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,"Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are."
9882,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
9883,orell,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,Unnamed Scene_31,"People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her."

9894,catelyn stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.
9895,robb stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERRUN, ROBB'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT_1",Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.

9918,robb stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ROBB AND TALISA'S CHAMBERS, LATER_1",Maybe one of each.

9979,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1","You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them."
9980,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.
9981,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",Of course.
9982,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.
9983,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1","I have, yes."
9984,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",May I ask why?
9985,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1","The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively."
9986,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1","So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?"
9987,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",We could arrange to have you carried.
9988,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
9989,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",Where did you hear about this?
9990,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",Is it true?
9991,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",Apparently so.
9992,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",Don't you think we ought to do something about it?
9993,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1","When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple."
9994,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
9995,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1","Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us."
9996,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
9997,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
9998,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",But I haven't been counseled.
9999,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",You are being counseled at this very moment.
10000,joffrey baratheon,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1",I should be consulted about such things.
10001,tywin lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"KING'S LANDING, THRONE ROOM_1","From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace."

10004,jorah mormont,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1","On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man."
10005,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1",I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
10006,jorah mormont,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1","We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne."

10008,jorah mormont,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1",Two hundred thousand if not more.
10009,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1",Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city.
10010,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"ESSOS, OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1","(speaks Valyrian) Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor."

10016,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1,"Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi."
10017,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1,Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
10018,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1,"If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people."
10019,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1,The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.
10020,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1,There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
10021,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1,My ship?
10022,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1,"Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require."
10023,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1,And what do you ask in return?
10024,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1,All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.

10027,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1,"And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
10028,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1,"You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends.

10029,razdal mo eraz,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1,You swore me safe conduct.
10030,daenerys targaryen,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,ROAD TO YUNKAI_1,"I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother."

10138,theon greyjoy,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",He sent you.
10139,myranda,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",Who sent us?
10140,violet,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3","We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy."
10141,myranda,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",We heard so much about it. (giggles)
10142,theon greyjoy,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",Please.
10143,violet,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",Oh! There it is.
10144,violet,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",Oh. Do you think we're ugly? He thinks we're ugly.
10145,myranda,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3","Well, he's been through so much. Look at his poor face."
10146,theon greyjoy,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",Help me. If he comes back-
10147,violet,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",We need to make him feel better.
10148,myranda,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",And how can we make him feel better?
10149,violet,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",I have an idea.
10150,violet,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3","Oh, she's shy. You know how they are, these religious girls."
10151,myranda,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",Maybe he doesn't know how we are.
10152,myranda,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3","Oh. I felt something. Oh, Lord Greyjoy."
10153,violet,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",As good as they say?
10154,myranda,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",Mmm.
10155,violet,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",And why should you get all the fun?
10156,myranda,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",What? You like her better?
10157,violet,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",Plenty there for both of us.
10158,myranda,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",I was here first.

10162,ramsay bolton,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",But I was getting jealous.
10163,ramsay bolton,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?
10164,ramsay bolton,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back.
10165,ramsay bolton,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part?
10166,theon greyjoy,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3","Please. No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!"
10167,ramsay bolton,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_3",This is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations.

10170,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS_1",I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.
10171,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS_1",It's too far away.
10172,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",Is that a palace?
10173,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",It's a windmill.
10174,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",Windmill. Who built it? Some king?
10175,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",Just the men who used to live here.
10176,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3","They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high."
10177,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",Winterfell has towers three times that size.
10178,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",'I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.'
10179,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3","If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell."
10180,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",What's swooning?
10181,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",Fainting.
10182,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",What's fainting?
10183,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",When a girl sees blood and collapses.
10184,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
10185,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",Well not all girls are like you.
10186,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3","Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? (gasps) Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow."
10187,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
10188,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",I'd like to see you in a silk dress.
10189,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",Would you?
10190,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",So I could tear it off you.
10191,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3","Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye."
10192,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
10193,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.
10194,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3","Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that."
10195,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",You know nothing-
10196,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3","Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed."
10197,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",And how do you know that?
10198,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3","Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same."
10199,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",Mance is different.
10200,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
10201,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",You don't know that.
10202,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3","I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you."
10203,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3",All of us.
10204,ygritte,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3","You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live."
10205,jon snow,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, WOODS, LATER_3","Yes, first we'll live."
10206,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?
10207,hodor,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",Hodor.
10208,jojen reed,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",That's where we are.
10209,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",What are you telling him?
10210,bran stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1","It's all right, Osha."
10211,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day?  Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.
10212,meera reed,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",Leave him alone.
10213,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",He can speak for himself.
10214,jojen reed,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",I don't fill his head with anything.
10215,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",So what do you talk about?
10216,jojen reed,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",What's happening to him and what that means.
10217,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1","Go on, then. Tell us what it means."
10218,jojen reed,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.
10219,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
10220,jojen reed,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",We're not going to Castle Black.
10221,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",What did you say?
10222,jojen reed,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
10223,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1","Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me."
10224,bran stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.
10225,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
10226,bran stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
10227,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1","Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone."
10228,bran stark,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1",You don't understand. You don't know.
10229,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1","You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long."
10230,osha,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"THE NORTH, CAMP_1","I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further."
10231,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1","How is the pain, my lord?"
10232,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
10233,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1","Well, we've stymied the corruption."
10234,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1","Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man."
10235,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",All the good it's done me.
10236,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
10237,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1","Faint praise, my lord."
10238,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
10239,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1","No, my lord. That's not my weakness."
10240,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",What is?
10241,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
10242,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",You performed experiments on living men.
10243,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",On dying men.
10244,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",With their permission?
10245,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
10246,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1","Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside."
10247,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1","How many men have you killed, my lord?"
10248,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",I don't know.
10249,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",Fifty? A hundred?
10250,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",(shakes his head)
10251,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",Countless.
10252,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",Countless has a nice ring to it.
10253,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",And how many lives have you saved?
10254,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
10255,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
10256,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",A fair offer.
10257,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",A fair offer. Locke won't take it.
10258,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",Why not?
10259,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
10260,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",(sighs)
10261,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",He feels he's being cheated.
10262,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",They'd be fools to kill her.
10263,qyburn,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1","These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much."
10264,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",We have to return to Harrenhal.
10266,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",I've left something behind.
10268,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",And what are those orders?
10270,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",You think you'll get a reward.
10272,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1","You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off."
10274,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,"RIVERLANDS, OPEN FIELD_1",Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.
10275,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,Whoa.
10277,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,Be quiet.
10280,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,"Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight."
10281,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,A wooden sword?
10282,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,I thought you'd gone.
10283,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,You gave her a wooden sword.
10284,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,We've only got one bear.
10285,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,"I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there."
10286,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
10287,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.
10288,brienne of tarth,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,Ah!
10289,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,Get behind me.
10290,brienne of tarth,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,I will not.
10291,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
10293,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,Pull her up.
10294,brienne of tarth,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,Hold my legs.
10295,brienne of tarth,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,Pull him up!
10296,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,The bitch stays.
10297,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
10298,locke,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.
10299,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton?  Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
10300,jaime lannister,3,27,the bear and the maiden fair,THE RUINS OF HARRENHAL_1,"Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires."

10305,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1","Ha, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them."
10306,arya stark,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1",You're lying.
10307,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1","Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open."
10308,arya stark,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1",Is that the Blackwater?
10309,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1",The Blackwater?  Where do you think I'm taking you?
10310,arya stark,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1",Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
10311,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1",Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.
10312,arya stark,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1",But why?
10313,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1",Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
10314,arya stark,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1",Why would they be at the Twins?
10315,sandor clegane,3,28,second sons,"RIVERLANDS, EDGE OF WOODS, LATER_1",Those outlaws you love so much never told you?  The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
10316,barristan selmy,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.
10317,jorah mormont,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
10318,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,You know these men?
10319,jorah mormont,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,"Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, ""The Titan's Bastard."""
10320,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,Is he more titan or bastard?
10321,jorah mormont,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,"He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are."
10322,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,How many?
10323,barristan selmy,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,"Two thousand, Your Grace. Armored and mounted."
10324,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,Enough to make a difference?
10325,barristan selmy,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,(nods)
10326,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
10327,jorah mormont,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,I imagine you're right.
10328,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
10329,jorah mormont,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,He may not agree to meet.
10330,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,ESSOS_5,He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
10331,barristan selmy,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,"Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and-"
10332,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,Daario Naharis
10333,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,You are the Mother of Dragons?  I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
10334,jorah mormont,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,Mind your tongue.
10335,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
10336,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,"(laughs) You, slave girl, bring wine."
10337,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,We have no slaves here.
10338,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.
10339,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,"Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?"
10340,barristan selmy,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,"Under two thousand, Your Grace."
10341,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,"We have more, don't we?"
10342,barristan selmy,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,Ten thousand Unsullied.
10343,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,"I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us."
10344,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have eight thousand Unsullied.
10345,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,You're very young to be a captain.
10346,prendahl na ghezn,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.
10347,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,"Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side."
10348,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
10349,jorah mormont,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
10350,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,Or you could fight for me.
10351,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.
10352,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,I would pay you as much and more.
10353,prendahl na ghezn,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,"Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again."
10354,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
10355,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.
10356,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,"A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide."
10357,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.
10358,grey worm,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,"(speaks Valyrian) My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?"
10359,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,(speaks Valyrian) These men are our guests. (Speaks common.) You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
10360,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
10361,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,"A barrel, then."
10362,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,"Good. The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we'll all share you."
10363,mero,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,I'll come looking for you when this is over.
10364,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,"Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first."
10365,barristan selmy,3,28,second sons,An open tent outside of Yunkai_1,"Gladly, Your Grace."
10366,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1","Half Robert, half lowborn."
10367,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1",Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon.
10368,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1",What do you mean to do with him?
10369,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1",You know what I mean to do with him.
10370,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1","Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?  If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy."
10371,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1","Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?"
10372,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1",No.
10373,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1","If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor."
10374,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1",You've slaughtered many lambs?
10375,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, WAR ROOM_1",And none have seen the blade.
10376,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1","'And tho- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod- rode Vhagar- Vhag-' Fuck me. 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog- enough- enough to swallow a horse whole."
10377,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",Your Grace.
10378,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",They feeding you enough?
10379,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1","Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain."
10380,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",You don't belong in a place like this.
10381,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1","Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse."
10382,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",Yeah.
10383,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
10384,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",(nods)
10385,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",Melisandre's returned.
10386,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",I didn't know she'd been gone.
10387,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
10388,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",Why?
10389,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",She says there's power in king's blood.
10390,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",She's going to kill him.
10391,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",Sacrifice him.
10392,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1","Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew."
10393,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
10394,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",Because he has your blood in his veins.
10395,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",So did Renly.
10396,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1","Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent."
10397,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1","How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no?  Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?"
10398,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1","Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?"
10399,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
10400,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
10401,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1",You have little regard for your own life.
10402,davos seaworth,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1","Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night."
10403,stannis baratheon,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_1","I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
10404,prendahl na ghezn,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.
10405,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,You talk too much.
10406,mero,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
10407,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,Eight thousand Unsullied stand between her and your cock.
10408,mero,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
10409,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
10410,mero,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,"Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores."
10411,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,"I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend."
10412,mero,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference?
10413,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,I fight for beauty.
10414,prendahl na ghezn,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,For beauty?
10415,mero,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,We fight for gold.
10416,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
10417,mero,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,You'll die young.
10418,prendahl na ghezn,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,What do we do about the dragon girl?  We can't beat eight thousand Unsullied on the battlefield.
10419,mero,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.
10420,prendahl na ghezn,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,She's well guarded.
10421,mero,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,Tonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
10422,prendahl na ghezn,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,Which one of us?
10423,mero,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,"Close your eyes, love."
10424,mero,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,"Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking."
10425,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I'm right here.
10426,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,You have something for me?
10427,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,OUTSIDE YUNKAI_1,Valar morghulis.
10428,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5",Lady Sansa.
10429,sansa stark,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5","You look very handsome, my lord."
10430,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5","Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?"
10431,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5","My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this."
10432,sansa stark,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5","I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord."
10433,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5","No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel."
10434,sansa stark,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5","I doubt that very much, my lord."
10435,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5",You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
10436,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5","But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?"
10437,sansa stark,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5",When I have to.
10438,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS_5","Well, today you have to."
10439,margaery tyrell,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3","You look radiant, Your Grace."
10440,cersei lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3",Radiant? Why radiant?
10441,margaery tyrell,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3",It's the word that came to mind.
10442,margaery tyrell,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3",We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.
10443,cersei lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3","You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice."
10444,margaery tyrell,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3","A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid."
10445,cersei lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3","Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?"
10446,margaery tyrell,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3",Of course. They play it so often here at court.
10447,cersei lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3",So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
10448,margaery tyrell,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3","Not as well as you, I'm sure."
10449,cersei lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3",House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?

10451,cersei lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3","Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"
10452,margaery tyrell,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3",Gone.
10453,cersei lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3","Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword."
10454,cersei lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, THE SEPT OF BAELOR_3","I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'"

10473,gendry,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1","That thought had crossed my mind, yeah."
10474,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1",There are no mistakes. Not for us.
10475,gendry,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1",I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
10476,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1","Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us."
10477,gendry,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1",I don't understand. This- this doesn't seem very religious.

10485,gendry,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1",Why are you doing this?
10486,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1",I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
10487,gendry,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1","No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!"
10488,melisandre,3,28,second sons,"DRAGONSTONE, GENDRY'S CHAMBERS_1",You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.

10499,tywin lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1",You seem rather drunk.
10500,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1",Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
10501,tywin lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1","This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."

10503,tywin lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, WEDDING RECEPTION_1","If you're going to give her one, you need to perform."

10513,sansa stark,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,"Yes, Your Grace."
10514,joffrey baratheon,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that?
10515,joffrey baratheon,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
10516,joffrey baratheon,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,Time for the bedding ceremony.
10517,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,There will be no bedding ceremony.

10521,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
10522,joffrey baratheon,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,What did you say? What did you say?
10523,tywin lannister,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,"I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king."
10524,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,"A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there."
10525,tywin lannister,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,"Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace."
10526,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.
10527,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,"My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife."
10528,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,THE WEDDING RECEPTION_1,"I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree?  Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood."
10529,sansa stark,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"Is that wise, my lord?"
10530,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion."
10531,sansa stark,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"Is that wise, Tyrion?"
10532,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,Nothing was ever wiser.
10533,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,Astoundingly long.
10534,sansa stark,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,What?
10535,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
10536,sansa stark,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,Fourteen.
10537,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage."

10539,sansa stark,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,But your father-
10540,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,"If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to."
10541,sansa stark,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,What if I never want you to?
10542,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,TYRION'S CHAMBERS_1,And so my watch begins.

10547,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,"Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?"
10548,missandei,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.
10549,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,(in Dothraki) Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.

10558,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,No screaming or she dies.
10559,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,What do you want?
10560,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,You.
10561,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,Let her go.
10562,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,"Don't scream, lovely girl."
10563,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,You were sent here to kill me?

10565,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,So why haven't you?
10566,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,I don't want to.
10567,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,What do your captains have to say about that?
10568,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,You should ask them.
10569,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,Why?
10570,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,We had philosophical differences.
10571,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,Over what?
10572,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
10573,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,You're a strange man.
10574,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
10575,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,And this is supposed to impress me?
10576,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,Yes.
10577,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
10578,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
10579,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,Will you fight for me?
10580,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,(nods)
10581,daenerys targaryen,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,Swear to me.
10582,daario naharis,3,28,second sons,DAENERYS'S TENT_1,"The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours."
10583,tyrion lannister,3,28,second sons,"KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS, MORNING_1",You really ought to knock.

10592,gilly,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1",I doubt it.

10594,gilly,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1",He blinked.
10595,sam,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1",I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
10596,gilly,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1",A what?
10597,sam,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1","Well, I mean, there's no real difference."
10598,gilly,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1",A wink is on purpose.
10599,sam,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1",You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
10600,gilly,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1",Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
10601,sam,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1",What? No. This is just the way I talk.
10602,gilly,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1",I'll build that fire.

10609,sam,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1","That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name."
10610,gilly,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1",Why is it a last name?
10611,sam,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1","Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly."
10612,gilly,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1","His name is Samwell Tarly, too?"
10613,sam,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1","No, Randyll Tarly."

10616,gilly,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1",Is your father cruel like mine?
10617,sam,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1",Different manner of cruel.
10618,gilly,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1","Not Randyll, then."
10619,gilly,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1",Don't. Don't go out there.
10620,sam,3,28,second sons,"THE BROKEN FARMHOUSE, NIGHT_1",I'll be back. I just want to look.

The fault is not with you.  Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.  I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another.  I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house.  I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends."
10653,walder frey,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_34,Very good.
10654,walder frey,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_34,"There she is.  Come closer, let me have a look at you."
10655,walder frey,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_34,Still can't see you.  Old eyes.
10656,walder frey,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_34,"Love.  That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?  Heh. Very honorable, I call it a pretty face.  Mmmm, very pretty.  Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.  Very shapely as well.  Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.  If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place."
10657,walder frey,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_34,"I can always see what's going on beneath a dress.  Been at this a long time.  I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is.  Doesn't drop an inch."
10658,walder frey,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_34,Your king says he betrayed me for love.  I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.
10659,walder frey,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_34,"And I can respect that.  When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought.  Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot.  We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men."
10660,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_34,"Thank you, my lord."
10661,walder frey,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_34,"Well, let's get ready.  The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us."
10662,daenerys targaryen,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,Where?
10663,daario naharis,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,There.
10664,daario naharis,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,"There, it's a back gate.  My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves."
10665,jorah mormont,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,Your men but not you?
10666,daario naharis,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,I have no interest in slaves.  A man cannot make love to property.
10667,daario naharis,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,"This is where we enter the city.  Very few guards, they know me.  They let me inside."
10668,barristan selmy,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.
10669,daario naharis,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,"I kill the guards.  I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates."
10670,daario naharis,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,"Then comes the army.  Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours."
10671,jorah mormont,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,"Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army.  The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners."
10672,daario naharis,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,"You have a very suspicious mind.  In my experience, only dishonest people think this way."
10673,jorah mormont,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,You command the Unsullied.  What do you think?
10674,daenerys targaryen,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,"[Speaking to Grey Worm in Valyrian] Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa."
10675,grey worm,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,[In Valyrian] I trust him.
10676,daenerys targaryen,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,"[Speaking in the Common Tongue (in this case, English) again] You leave tonight."
10677,jorah mormont,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,Very good.  We'll prepare.
10678,barristan selmy,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,Ser Jorah.  You can use an extra sword.
10679,jorah mormont,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_36,"You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan.  Your place is by the Queen.  If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done.  No matter the cost, no matter our pride."
10680,samwell tarly,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_37,"We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us.  It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.  Too big, impossible to maintain.  Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.  It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.  No one's used it for centuries, most likely.  It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do."
10681,gilly,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_37,How do you know all that?
10682,samwell tarly,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_37,I read about it in a very old book.
10683,gilly,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_37,You know all that from staring at marks on paper?
10684,samwell tarly,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_37,Yes.
10685,gilly,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_37,You're like a wizard.
10686,gilly,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_37,Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived.  Here we are.  Alive.
10687,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,Remember what happens to children who run.  I'm your father and I'll do the talking.
10688,pig farmer,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,"The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning."
10689,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,Need a hand?
10690,pig farmer,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,Need about eight hands.
10691,pig farmer,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding.
10692,pig farmer,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,Many thanks.
10693,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,Don't! Don't kill him.
10694,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,Dead rats don't squeak.
10695,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,"You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people.  A real hard man you are."
10696,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,More than anyone you know.
10697,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,You're wrong.  I know a killer. A real killer.
10698,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,That so?
10699,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,You'd be like a kitten to him.  He'd kill you with his little finger.
10700,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,That him?
10701,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,No.
10702,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,Good.
10703,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,Don't kill him!  Please.  Please don't.
10704,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_38,You're very kind.  Someday it'll get you killed.
10705,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_39,Where are we?
10706,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_39,"The Gift, I think.  Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night’s Watch for their sustenance and support.  Maester Luwin taught me that."
10707,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_39,Doesn’t seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.
10708,meera reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_39,It’s good land and there’s no war up here.  Why leave?
10709,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_39,Wildlings.
10710,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_39,"Sorry.  But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women."
10711,rickon stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_39,Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.
10712,rickon stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_39,That’s what Old Nan said.
10713,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_39,There’s a storm coming.
10714,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_39,I don’t see any.
10715,meera reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_39,It’s as good a place to shelter as any.
10716,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_39,We can drink some blood while we wait.  I don’t need much.
10717,orell,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,Only one old man and eight good horses.
10718,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,What’s one old man doing with eight horses?
10719,jon snow,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,He breeds them for the Watch.
10720,ygritte,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,How’s he keep folks from stealing them?
10721,jon snow,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,The Watch protects him.
10722,orell,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,"Not today they don’t.  He’s selling horses, he’s got some gold in there."
10723,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,And proper steel.
10724,orell,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,Let’s carve him up.
10725,jon snow,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,We just take the horses and go.  The old man’s no threat.
10726,orell,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,I keep telling you.
10727,ygritte,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,He’s an old man.  A spear through the heart’s a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
10728,jon snow,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.  They’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
10729,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,"I hope so.  Killing crows in their castle is tough.  Killing them out here in the open, that’s what we do."
10730,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,Spread out.  Surround the hut and move in.
10731,jon snow,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,Ygritte!
10732,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_40,Clear the barn!
10733,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_41,No one’s going to believe you’re a hog farmer if you eat them all.
10734,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_41,Best part of the animal.
10735,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_41,"Don’t worry, they’re still there."
10736,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_41,I know they’re still there.
10737,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_41,You check every five minutes like you’re afraid they’re gonna move.
10738,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_41,I’m not afraid.
10739,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_41,"Of course you are.  You’re almost there and you’re afraid you won’t make it.  The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.  No point in trying to hide behind that face.  I know fear when I see it.  Seen it a lot."
10740,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_41,I knew fear when I saw it in you.  You’re afraid of fire.
10741,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_41,"When Beric’s sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl."
10742,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_41,"And I know why, too.  I heard what your brother did to you.  Pressed your face to the fire like you’re a nice juicy mutton chop."
10743,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_41,That give you some ideas?
10744,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_41,Might do.
10745,sandor clegane,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_41,Go ahead then.  You might get away.  Might even make it there on your own.  They’re just over the river.  The closest you’ve been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy’s neck.
10746,arya stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_41,Someday I’m gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
10747,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,How are we going to get past the Wall?  My uncle said it’s 700 feet high.
10748,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,How did you get past it?
10749,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
10750,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
10751,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Some climb straight up the ice.
10752,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Even Hodor’s not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.
10753,hodor,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Hodor!
10754,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Nineteen castles guard the Wall.  Only three are still manned.
10755,hodor,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Hodor!
10756,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.
10757,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.
10758,meera reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,"Well, we’ll have to open them up again."
10760,meera reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,There’s a rider out there.
10761,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Just one?
10762,meera reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,There’s more.
10763,hodor,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Hodor!
10764,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,"It’s just thunder, sweet giant."
10765,hodor,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Hodor.
10767,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Wildlings.
10768,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,[To BRAN and RICKON]  Where’s Shaggydog and Summer?
10769,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Hunting.
10770,hodor,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Hodor!
10771,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,"Shhh, quiet, Hodor."
10772,hodor,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Hodor!
10773,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,[To BRAN] Make him shut up.  If they hear us…
10774,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,"[To Hodor] Hush, Hodor.  No, no more Hodoring."
10775,hodor,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Hodor!
10776,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,"Hodor, calm down."
10777,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,You need to keep quiet.
10778,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,They’re gonna hear us.
10779,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,"Hodor, be quiet."
10780,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,"Hodor, calm down.  Hodor, be quiet!"
10781,meera reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,[To BRAN] What did you do?
10782,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,Nothing.  I don’t know.
10783,rickon stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,What’s That?
10784,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_42,That’s a horse dying.
10787,orell,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_43,[To TORMUND] I heard shouting up there.
10788,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_43,Thunder.
10789,orell,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_43,I know the difference between shouting and thunder.
10790,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_43,Maybe it's ghosts.
10791,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_43,"That won’t help you, grandpa."
10792,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_43,Where you riding?
10794,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_43,"No, it doesn’t matter now."
10795,orell,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_43,Cut his throat or he’ll tell the crows we’re here.
10796,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_43,You understand.
10799,orell,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_43,[Looks at JON] Make the crow kill him. [Walks towards JON]  You’re one of us now.  Prove it.
10800,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,[Looks at BRAN]  The wolves are out there.
10801,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,I can’t do it by choice.  I don’t know how.  It happens in my dreams.
10802,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,"You’re a warg, Bran.  It’s in your blood."
10803,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,I can’t.
10804,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,"You just did, with him."
10805,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,A wolf is nothing compared to that.
10807,ygritte,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,[Looks at Jon]  Do it.  Do it.
10808,orell,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,Told ya.  He’s still one of them.
10809,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,"Go on, boy."
10810,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,Go on!
10811,orell,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,He’s a crow.  He’ll always be a crow.  And here’s his crow wife guarding him.  He’ll stab us in the back first chance he gets.
10812,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,Kill him!
10813,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,He’s one of them!
10814,ygritte,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,No!
10815,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,Do you hear me?
10816,tormund,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,You’re not gonna die for one of them.
10817,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,Do it.  They’ll find us if you don’t.
10818,jon snow,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_44,You were right the whole time.
10819,daario naharis,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_45,"When you hear a songbird’s whistle, you come.  I’m a great whistler, the greatest in the land."
10820,daario naharis,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_45,Daario Naharis.
10821,daario naharis,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_45,That one was quick.
10822,jorah mormont,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_45,There may be others.
10823,daario naharis,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_45,I doubt it.  The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.
10824,jorah mormont,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_45,[Addressing DAARIO] That’s what you call a few guards?
10825,roslin,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_46,"Lord Edmure, I hope I’m not a disappointment to you."
10826,edmure tully,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_46,"You’re a delight to me, my lady."
10827,septon,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_46,You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
10828,septon,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_46,"In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity.  Look upon each other and say the words."
10830,meera reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,Is that safe?
10831,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,They’re long gone.
10832,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,[Looks at JOJEN] You were right.  I can get inside Summer’s mind whenever I want.
10833,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,Of course you can.  North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals.  But you did a lot more than that.  You got inside Hodor’s mind.
10834,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,They can’t do that north of the Wall?
10835,jojen reed,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,No one can do that.  Anywhere.
10836,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,"[Looks at RICKON]  When I was looking through Summer’s eyes, I saw Jon."
10837,rickon stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,Where?
10838,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,He was with the wildlings.  They tried to kill him but he got away.
10839,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,He’ll be heading back to Castle Black then.  That’s where we should go.
10840,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,"For all we know, Castle Black’s already under attack.  If this many wildlings got through-"
10841,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,I already told you.  I’m not going north of the Wall.
10842,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,Everything Jojen told me is true.  You saw what I did to Hodor.  I have to find the three-eyed raven.
10843,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,"Listen to me, little lord."
10844,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,"Don’t worry, I’m not asking you to come with me.  It won’t be safe for Rickon."
10845,rickon stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,[Surprised] Me? I’m coming with you.
10846,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,No.  You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.  The Umbers are our bannermen.  They’ll protect you.
10847,rickon stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,I’m coming with you.  I’m your brother.  I have to protect you.
10848,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,"Right now, I have to protect you."
10849,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,"Robb’s at war and I’m going beyond the Wall.  If something happens to us, you’re the heir to Winterfell."
10850,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,[Looks at OSHA]  Will you know how to find the last Hearth?
10851,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,You Southerners build your big castles and you never move.  You’re easy to find.
10852,rickon stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,We’re not Southerners.
10853,rickon stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,And I don’t want to leave you.
10854,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,"Shhh.  [She grabs RICKON by the waist and sits him on her lap]  Come here, little soldier.  You and me, we’re gonna have some adventures."
10855,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,You don’t have to do any of this.
10856,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,"Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be.  [To RICKON] Shhh.  We’ll be fine, you and me.  The Umbers are great warriors.  Even I heard about them growing up.  They’ll teach you how to swing a sword."
10857,rickon stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,"[Crying, looks at OSHA]  I know how to swing a sword."
10858,bran stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,You’re leaving now?  It’s the middle of the night.
10859,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,I learned to walk in darkness.
10860,osha,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_47,"Say your good-byes, little man."

10863,jorah mormont,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_48,[Looks at DAENERYS]  It was just as you said.  They did not believe until it was too late.  Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
10864,daenerys targaryen,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_48,And Daario Naharis?
10865,daario naharis,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_48,"The city is yours, my queen."

10867,lothar frey,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,They ought to be because they cost enough.
10868,brynden tully,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,Look at the crowd there.
10869,catelyn stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,[Looking at EDMURE and talking to BLACKFISH] He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him.

10873,catelyn stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,"Don’t you drink, Lord Bolton?"
10874,roose bolton,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,"Never do, my lady.  Dulls the senses."
10875,brynden tully,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,That’s the point. [Still talking to ROOSE while the servant pours him more wine] Didn’t you marry one of these Frey girls?
10876,roose bolton,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,"Aye.  Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl’s weight in silver as a dowry.  So I have a fat, young bride."
10877,catelyn stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,I hope she makes you very happy.
10878,roose bolton,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,"Well, she’s made me very rich."
10879,brynden tully,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,"Pardon, my lord, my lady.  I need to find a tree to piss on."
10880,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,My mother’s alone with Roose Bolton.  I should rescue her.
10881,talisa stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I’ve ever met.
10882,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,Be kind.  She’s finally starting to like you.
10883,talisa stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,"And I like her.  But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there [Looks at EDMURE and ROSLIN], eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey’s hand."
10884,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,Perhaps I’ve made a terrible mistake.
10885,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,Striking your king is an act of treason.

But they are not yet man and wife.  A sword needs a sheath [Everybody laughs]. And a wedding needs a bedding [Everybody cheers].  What does my sire say?"
10890,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,"[Gets up from his seat and addresses WALDER] If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them."
10892,edmure tully,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,"Ho-ho!  Careful now, ladies.  Once you set that monster free, there’s no caging him again [Laughs]."
10894,catelyn stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,Poor girl.
10895,roose bolton,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,Every bride suffers the same.  I’m sure you endured yours with grace.
10896,catelyn stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,"Oh, Ned forbade it.  He said it wouldn’t be right if he broke a man’s jaw on our wedding night."
10897,talisa stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,That is a very strange custom.
10898,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner’s perspective.
10899,talisa stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,It seems normal to you?
10900,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,"It’s tradition. [TALISA stares at ROBB]  Without the bedding ceremony, there’s no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage."
10901,talisa stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,"No, but there are other ways of providing proof."
10902,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,Boy or girl?
10903,talisa stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,"I don’t know.  But if it’s a boy, I know what we should name him."
10904,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,"Oh, do you?   It seems to me the father should have some say in his son’s naming."
10905,talisa stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,Eddard. [Catches ROBB by surprise] Don’t you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
10906,robb stark,3,29,the rains of castamere,Unnamed Scene_49,I do.

10942,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9",I have a list.
10943,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9",A list of people you mean to kill?
10944,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9","For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-"

10953,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9",Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
10954,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9",I hear that you're a pervert.
10955,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9",I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
10956,sansa stark,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_9","(chuckles) We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from."

10973,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,No. She is no longer yours to torment.
10974,joffrey baratheon,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,"Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster."
10975,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,"Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
10976,joffrey baratheon,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,I could have your tongue out for saying that.
10977,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
10978,pycelle,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,"Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste."
10979,joffrey baratheon,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,I am the king! I will punish you.

10983,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,Come along.
10984,joffrey baratheon,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,I'm not tired.

10989,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,Not you.
10990,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
10991,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
10992,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
10993,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,You really think a crown gives you power?
10994,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,No. I think armies give you power.
10995,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,Mm-hmm.
10996,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,"Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same."

10998,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,"Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances."
10999,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
11000,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,I'm all for cheating. This is war.
11001,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
11002,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,So that's why you did it? To save lives?
11003,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,"To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
11004,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,The Northerners will never forget.
11005,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
11006,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
11007,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
11008,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,"One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
11009,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,I will not rape her.
11010,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
11011,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
11012,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.

11014,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,Does that amuse you?
11015,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,"No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
11016,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,"Easy for me, is it?"
11017,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
11018,tywin lannister,3,30,mhysa,THE HAND'S CHAMBERS_1,"The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister."

11022,hodor,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1",Hodor. Hodor.
11023,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1","Don't, Hodor."
11024,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1",Maybe we shouldn't stay.
11025,meera reed,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1",You'd rather be out there?
11026,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1",There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
11027,jojen reed,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1",I always quite liked the horrible stories.
11028,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1",So did I. Once.
11029,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1",You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
11030,meera reed,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1",No. Who's he?
11031,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1","Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry."
11032,meera reed,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1",If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-
11033,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"ABANDOND NIGHTFORT, LATER_1",It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.
11034,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1","'The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I'm Lord of Riverrun. (laughs)"
11035,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",The Blackfish escaped.
11036,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
11037,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",As you say.
11038,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1","They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?"
11039,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",You'll be needing a new young girl.
11040,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",Yeah. Got that to look forward to.
11041,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",(grunts)
11042,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1","And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country."
11043,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant-
11044,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
11045,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",(nods)
11046,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1","Well, here's to the Young Wolf! (howls)"
11047,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",Forever young.
11048,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
11049,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
11050,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1","Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing."
11051,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.  Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon.
11052,walder frey,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",Oh. And?
11053,roose bolton,3,30,mhysa,"THE TWINS, DINING HALL_1",Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
11054,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5","Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock."
11055,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
11056,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
11057,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5","Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?"
11058,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
11059,theon greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",(cries)
11060,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",But my father taught me to aim for their head.
11061,theon greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",Kill me.
11062,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5","Sorry, what?"
11063,theon greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",Kill me.
11064,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",A little louder.
11065,theon greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",Kill me!
11066,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",You're no good to me dead. We need you.
11067,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5","You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat."
11068,theon greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",(groans)
11069,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",Stinking meat.
11070,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?
11071,theon greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",Theon Greyjoy.
11072,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",What's your name?
11073,theon greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",Th- Theon Greyjoy.
11074,theon greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",Please.
11075,ramsay bolton,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",What is your name?!
11076,theon greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,"DUNGEON, SOMEWHERE_5",Reek. My name is Reek.
11077,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Hodor.
11078,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Don't kill me!
11079,meera reed,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Who are you?
11080,gilly,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Sam! Sam!
11081,meera reed,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Who are you?!
11082,gilly,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Gilly. Don't hurt us.
11083,jojen reed,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Where are you going?
11084,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
11085,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1","My brother, he's in the Night's-"
11086,jojen reed,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Shush.
11087,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Who's your brother?
11088,jojen reed,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Doesn't matter.
11089,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
11090,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1","No, I'm not."
11091,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.
11092,hodor,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Hodor.
11093,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1","I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will."
11094,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Take us north of the Wall.
11095,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",What? Why in the world would you want to go-
11096,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",I don't want to. I have to.
11097,jojen reed,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",How did you get through the Wall?
11098,meera reed,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
11099,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
11100,gilly,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",Come with us. There's nothing north but death.
11101,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1","If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you."
11102,jojen reed,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
11103,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1","What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way."
11104,jojen reed,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",You saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
11105,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",How do you know all that?
11106,jojen reed,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
11107,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1",But you're going to stop them?
11108,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, ABANDONED NIGHTFORT, NIGHT_1","Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to."
11109,balon greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1,"'Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all Ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home."

In the box you'll find a special gift- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him.'"

11113,balon greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1,"The boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me."
11114,yara greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1,He's your son.
11115,balon greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1,Son? He's not a man anymore.
11116,yara greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1,He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.
11117,balon greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1,Watch yourself. I've made my decision.
11118,yara greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,THE PYKE_1,And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
11119,yara greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,YARA aboard an Ironborn ship. The crew stands at attention as she walks past_1,(voiceover) I'm going to choose the fifty best killers on the Iron Islands.
11121,yara greyjoy,3,30,mhysa,YARA aboard an Ironborn ship. The crew stands at attention as she walks past_1,(voiceover) I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.

11123,jojen reed,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1",Dragonglass.
11124,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1",We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.

11126,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1",Killing White Walkers.
11127,meera reed,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1",How do you know that?
11128,gilly,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1",The Walker came for my baby. And Sam-
11129,meera reed,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1",But no one's killed a White Walker in thousands of years.
11130,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1","Well, I suppose someone had to be the first."
11131,bran stark,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1","Take it, Hodor."
11132,sam,3,30,mhysa,"THE NORTH, SECRET TUNNEL BETWEEN THE NIGHTFORT AND NORTH OF THE WALL_1","And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us."

11135,gendry,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",Great. Never better.
11136,davos seaworth,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",It was just a bit of blood.
11137,gendry,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3","I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want."
11138,davos seaworth,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",I'm not a highborn.
11139,gendry,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",She called you Ser. I heard it.
11140,davos seaworth,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
11141,gendry,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3","Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help."
11142,davos seaworth,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",I lived below the Street of Flour.
11143,gendry,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
11144,davos seaworth,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
11145,gendry,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",Gin Alley.
11146,davos seaworth,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3","The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king."
11147,gendry,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3","Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me."
11148,davos seaworth,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3","If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?"
11149,gendry,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3","You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?"
11150,davos seaworth,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3","She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that."
11151,gendry,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",So how'd you become a lord?
11152,davos seaworth,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3","Oh, that's a long story."
11153,gendry,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3","Better not, then. I'm a bit busy."
11154,davos seaworth,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.
11155,gendry,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",You see? Highborns.
11156,davos seaworth,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
11157,gendry,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",Why did you?
11158,davos seaworth,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
11159,gendry,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",Does he?
11160,davos seaworth,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",He's dead.
11161,gendry,3,30,mhysa,"DRAGONSTONE, DUNGEON_3",How'd he die?

11165,varys,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11",You were only a child.
11166,shae,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11",I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.
11167,varys,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11","You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking."
11168,shae,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11",And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
11169,varys,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11",She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
11170,shae,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11",I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?
11171,varys,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11","No, I expect not."

11175,varys,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11",You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.
11176,shae,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11","What do you want from me, Lord Varys?"
11177,varys,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11","Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up."
11178,shae,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11",Why do you want me to leave?
11179,varys,3,30,mhysa,"KING'S LANDING, GARDENS_11","Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time."

11183,podrick payne,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1","I don't think I can, my lord."

11187,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",She doesn't deserve this.
11188,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
11189,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
11190,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",(chuckles)
11191,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
11192,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
11193,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
11194,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
11195,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
11196,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",So she can have some happiness in her life.
11197,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",You have children. How happy would you say you are?
11198,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1","Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive."
11199,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",Even Joffrey?
11200,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1","Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own."
11201,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",How long does it go on?
11202,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",Until we've dealt with all our enemies.
11203,tyrion lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1","Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more."
11204,cersei lannister,3,30,mhysa,"TYRION'S CHAMBERS, EVENING_1",Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.

11225,arya stark,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5",From you.
11226,sandor clegane,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5",Is that the first man you've killed?
11227,arya stark,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5",The first man.
11228,sandor clegane,3,30,mhysa,"RIVERLANDS, WOODS_5","Next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first."

11249,sam,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1,"He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build five hundred miles of ice walls seve hundred feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us."
11250,aemon,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1,"Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being. We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall."

11252,aemon,3,30,mhysa,CASTLE BLACK_1,"Good. Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell. I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay."

11260,shireen baratheon,3,30,mhysa,DRAGONSTONE_9,My books are better than these boring scrolls. You could read about Balerion the Dread. They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. I'd like to see that someday.

And you are not an evil man."

11355,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,It is.
11356,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
11357,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.
11358,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
11359,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,From someone who no longer had need of it.
11360,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.
11361,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,And now we have two.
11362,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,Two?
11363,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.
11364,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,"Well, thank you. It's glorious."
11365,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,You'll have to train your left hand.
11366,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.

11369,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
11370,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.
11371,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.
11372,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
11373,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.
11374,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,Home?
11375,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.

11377,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
11378,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
11379,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.
11380,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,No.
11381,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,No?
11382,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,No.
11383,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,I don't believe I asked you a question.
11384,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,There's my answer.
11385,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,If you think your bloody honor comes before...
11386,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,"My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children."

11388,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,Supper would be nice.
11389,tywin lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,"For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve."

11420,bronn,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
11421,tyrion lannister,4,31,two swords,Unnamed Scene_51,"You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?"

11514,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.
11515,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.

11561,tyrion lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,Of course I don't love her.

11585,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,You let him touch you?
11586,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,You jealous?
11587,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.
11588,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,(Laughs) You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.
11589,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
11590,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,"Well, they smell like Pycelle."
11591,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,You drink more than you used to.
11592,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,Yes.
11593,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,Why?
11594,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,"Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident."
11595,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,It must have been traumatic for you.
11596,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.
11597,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,A rather short siege.
11598,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,"A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So..."
11599,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,Father disowned me today.
11600,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,He can't disown you. You're all he's got.
11601,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,You're forgetting Tyrion.
11602,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,"You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?"
11603,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
11604,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,Not now.
11605,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.
11606,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,Something's changed.
11607,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
11608,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,What do you want me to apologize for?
11609,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,For leaving me.
11610,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?
11611,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.
11612,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,"Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you."
11613,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,You took too long.
11614,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,I... What are you saying?
11615,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,I'm saying you took too long.
11616,cersei lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,Come in.
11617,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,Go away.
11618,marei,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,"Forgive me, Your Grace. You told me to come at once if there was anything important."
11619,tormund,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,You plan on killing all the crows yourself?
11620,ygritte,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?
11621,tormund,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,We wait for Mance's orders.
11622,ygritte,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,"You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back."
11623,tormund,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,"And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there."
11624,ygritte,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,"Yeah, well, he's a liar."
11625,tormund,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,"He is? Shouldn't it be ""he was""? You said you put three arrows in him."
11626,ygritte,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,I did.
11627,tormund,4,31,two swords,ESSOS village exterior._1,"I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go."
11628,tormund,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,Thenns. I fucking hate Thenns.
11629,tormund,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,Mance sent you?
11630,styr,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,(Grunts)
11631,tormund,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,How did you find us?
11632,tormund,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,"You came from the south, not the north."
11633,warg,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,Took a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way.
11634,styr,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?
11635,tormund,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,Help yourself.
11636,styr,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,(Chuckles) Maybe everything's just better fed down here.
11637,styr,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,"Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm?"
11638,styr,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,"You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?"
11639,tormund,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.
11640,styr,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,She yours?
11641,ygritte,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,I'm not anybody's.
11642,styr,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,Too scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black.
11643,styr,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,"Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled."
11644,styr,4,31,two swords,The crevice_1,"I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow."
11646,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. ""He said, "" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. (Winces) The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could."
11647,sam,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,Sometimes I want to hate you.
11648,sam,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading."
11649,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,(Chuckles)
11650,sam,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,They're... they're ready for you.
11651,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.
11652,sam,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.
11653,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,I've done plenty wrong.
11655,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,I didn't murder him.
11657,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,He wanted me to kill him.
11658,janos slynt,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?
11659,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
11661,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."
11662,janos slynt,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.
11663,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl."
11664,janos slynt,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"You admit to breaking your vows, then?"
11665,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,I do.
11666,janos slynt,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,The law is the law. The boy must die.
11667,aemon,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men."
11669,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000."
11671,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him."
11672,janos slynt,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,(Laughs) Giants?
11673,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?"
11674,janos slynt,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy."
11675,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.
11676,janos slynt,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,How dare you?!
11677,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
11678,jon snow,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?
11679,aemon,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on."
11681,aemon,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"Yes, you are."
11683,aemon,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,He told the truth.
11685,aemon,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,I grew up in King's Landing.
11686,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"No. No. You're a queen, not an ox."
11687,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.
11688,margaery tyrell,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything."
11689,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,Nonsense.
11690,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best."
11691,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that."
11692,margaery tyrell,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.
11693,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"You watch that. Even here, even with me."
11694,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,My word.
11695,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,My lady. My lady. Please pardon me for interrupting. My name is Brienne of Tarth.
11696,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.
11697,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.
11698,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,"My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment."
11699,olenna tyrell,4,31,two swords,Jon's quarters_1,You dare not refuse.
11700,margaery tyrell,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,A shadow?
11701,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king."
11702,margaery tyrell,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Joffrey is our king now.
11703,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,I meant no offense.
11704,margaery tyrell,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,And you've given none.
11705,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?"
11706,joffrey baratheon,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"Yes, yes, one guard at the... the thing. Go on."
11707,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.
11708,meryn trant,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"I've always guarded the king himself, my lord. Ever since your absence."
11709,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble."
11710,meryn trant,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,The people love their king. They know who keeps them fed.
11711,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"Margaery Tyrell, I've heard."
11712,joffrey baratheon,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,By my leave. They know I saved the city. They know I won the war.
11713,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.
11714,joffrey baratheon,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"I broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle."
11715,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy."
11716,joffrey baratheon,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Busy getting captured.
11717,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"So this is the famous ""Book of Brothers""? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. (Chuckles) Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. (Laughs) Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man."
11718,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,So they say.
11719,joffrey baratheon,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Ser Jaime Lannister. (Chuckles)
11720,joffrey baratheon,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.
11721,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,There's still time.
11722,joffrey baratheon,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that?
11723,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest."
11724,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Have you ever been to Meereen?
11725,missandei,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys."
11726,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,And?
11727,missandei,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen."
11728,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?
11729,missandei,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"If they're smart, Your Grace."
11730,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,You were told to ride at the back of the train.
11731,daario naharis,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"Yes, my queen. But I need to speak to you about something important. A matter of strategy."
11732,missandei,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Your Grace.
11733,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"All right, what is this matter of strategy?"
11734,daario naharis,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,A dusk rose.
11735,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?
11736,daario naharis,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,And this one's called lady's lace.
11737,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Would you like to walk without shoes?
11738,daario naharis,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"You have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy."
11739,daario naharis,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Harpy's Gold. No tea from this one. Beautiful but poisonous.
11740,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"You are a gambler, aren't you?"
11741,daario naharis,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Your Grace.
11742,jorah mormont,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.
11743,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,How many miles are there between here and Meereen?
11744,barristan selmy,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"163, Your Grace. I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this."
11745,daenerys targaryen,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.
11746,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,There she is.
11747,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"Yes, there she is."
11748,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,And? You made a promise.
11749,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.
11750,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,To keep them safe.
11751,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication."
11752,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,A complication does not release you from a vow.
11753,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?
11754,brienne of tarth,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.
11755,jaime lannister,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks."
11756,dontos hollard,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
11757,sansa stark,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,You're drunk.
11758,dontos hollard,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Yes. I have good reason to be. Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool. Don't you know me?
11759,sansa stark,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.
11760,dontos hollard,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"I can't accept your apology. I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you."
11761,sansa stark,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Anyone would have done the same.
11762,dontos hollard,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"But only you did. I can never repay you. You gave me my life. But this, this is worth more than my life."
11763,dontos hollard,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"It belonged to my mother and her mother before her. House Hollard was strong once. House on the rise. That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me."
11764,sansa stark,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't."
11765,dontos hollard,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,I don't have anything else left. That's all. Take it. Wear it. Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.
11766,sansa stark,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos."
11767,dontos hollard,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,Yeah.
11768,arya stark,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,When am I going to get a horse of my own?
11769,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,The little lady wants a pony.
11770,arya stark,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,The little lady wants away from your stench.
11771,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,Another part of the garden._1,"Horses aren't easy to come by. Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse? Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?"

11811,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1,So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.

11817,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1,I'm not going to King's Landing.
11818,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1,Think about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go. These are the king's colors. No one's standing in his way now. Which means no one's standing in ours.

11827,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1,Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.
11828,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1,You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.
11829,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1,Ah. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.
11830,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1,You don't seem to understand the situation.
11831,sandor clegane,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1,"I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room."
11832,polliver,4,31,two swords,FARMHOUSE INTERIOR_1,You lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens?

11912,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,What did you do to him?
11913,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,"I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned."
11914,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,You flayed him.
11915,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.
11916,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.

But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the Ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin."
11919,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no-
11920,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
11921,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.
11922,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.
11923,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,"Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us."
11924,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,I placed far too much trust in you.

11932,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.

11934,theon greyjoy,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,"No, my lord. Just two farm boys."
11935,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,And crisped them so no one would know.
11936,theon greyjoy,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,"Yes, my lord."
11937,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,"The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone."
11938,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,"Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?"

11944,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.
11945,ramsay bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,"Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat."
11946,roose bolton,4,32,the lion and the rose,DREADFORT INTERIOR_1,"You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position."

12126,brienne of tarth,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,"In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once."
12127,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,Did he? Haven't heard that story before.
12128,brienne of tarth,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,"Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid."
12129,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
12130,brienne of tarth,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,"I don't serve your brother, Your Grace."
12131,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,But you love him.
12132,brienne of tarth,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_1,Your Grace.
12133,pycelle,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3,"No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally."
12134,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3,She'll do no such thing.
12135,pycelle,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3,"Oh, Your Grace. Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice..."
12136,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3,You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.
12138,pycelle,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3,Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.
12139,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3,More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?
12140,pycelle,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3,"Your Grace, I am a man of learning."
12141,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3,My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
12142,pycelle,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3,I never meant to annoy anyone.
12143,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3,But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
12144,pycelle,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3,"Your Grace, Queen Margaery-"
12145,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_3,The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.
12146,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.
12147,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,You're in rather a good mood.
12148,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,I suppose I am.
12149,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,I won't ask why.
12150,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Small pleasures.
12151,oberyn martell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Your Grace. Lord Tywin.
12152,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Prince Oberyn.
12153,oberyn martell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand."
12154,ellaria sand,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,My lord. My lady.
12155,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Charmed.
12156,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.
12157,ellaria sand,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters."
12158,oberyn martell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne."
12159,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,No? How tolerant of you.
12160,oberyn martell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked."
12161,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding."
12162,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again."
12163,oberyn martell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.
12164,tywin lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
12165,oberyn martell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"People everywhere have their differences. In some places, the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place."
12166,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Everyone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords... my ladies..."
12167,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"I give you. King Joffrey... Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings."
12168,renly baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,I'm the rightful king.
12169,robb stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,King in the North!
12170,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Yes!
12171,balon dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Traitor. You're a traitor.
12172,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,For the Seven Kingdoms!
12173,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Let the war begin.
12174,stannis dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Renly, you're no king."
12175,balon dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Away, degenerate. Away. Away."
12176,renly baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Ooh, careful."
12177,stannis dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Go on.
12178,renly baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,I want you to be my prince. Stannis!
12179,balon dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Who's got the gold now, Stark?"
12180,robb stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,I am the rightful king.
12181,balon dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Challenge me, ruffian."
12182,robb stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Take that.
12183,balon dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,I'm drowning. I'm drowning.
12184,robb stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,I am the King in the North!
12185,stannis dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Not wildfire!
12186,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.
12187,podrick payne,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Yes, my lord."
12188,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,We'll have to find another way to thank the king.
12189,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Charge!
12190,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Ready, again."
12191,robb stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,I am the King in the North! - Charge!
12192,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Charge! Yes!
12193,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Your head!
12194,joffrey dwarf,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Fine gentlemen.
12195,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle. How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume."
12196,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night."
12197,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.
12198,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,It did not spill.
12199,margaery tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast."
12200,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cup-bearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight."
12201,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Your Grace does me a great honor.
12202,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,(miffed) It's not meant as an honor.
12203,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Bring me my goblet.
12204,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,What good is an empty cup? Fill it.
12205,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Kneel. Kneel before your king.
12206,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Kneel. I said... kneel!
12207,margaery tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"(Standing) Look, the pie."
12208,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,My queen.
12209,margaery tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Wonderful. Wonderful. My hero.
12210,sansa stark,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Can we leave now?
12211,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Let's find out.
12212,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cup-bearer, remember?"
12213,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace."
12214,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are. Serve me my wine."
12215,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Well, hurry up. This pie is dry."
12216,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Mm, good. Needs washing down."
12217,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired."
12218,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"No. (coughing) No, you'll wait here... un..."
12219,tyrion lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Your Grace?
12220,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,It's nothing.
12221,margaery tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,He's choking!
12222,olenna tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Help the poor boy.
12223,olenna tyrell,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Idiots, help your king."
12224,jaime lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Move away!
12225,jaime lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Joffrey! Joffrey!
12226,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Help him! Someone help him!
12227,joffrey baratheon,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,(gags)
12228,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Joffrey!
12229,dontos hollard,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,(to SANSA) Come with me now.
12230,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Joffrey! Joffrey!
12231,dontos hollard,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"If you want to live, we have to leave."
12232,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,Don't touch him!
12233,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!"
12234,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,My son.
12236,cersei lannister,4,32,the lion and the rose,THE HEAD TABLE_5,"He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!"
12237,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,You did this. You did this!
12238,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,We have to leave.
12239,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,Take him! Take him!
12240,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?
12241,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.
12242,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,Where is she?!
12243,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,No one leaves the capital! No one!
12244,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,Get in.
12245,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,Where are we going?
12246,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,Somewhere safe.
12247,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,"Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know."
12248,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,Lord Baelish?
12249,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,"Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?"
12250,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,(shakes her head.)
12251,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past.  Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.
12252,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.
12253,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,"Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water."
12254,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,"I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.  LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?"
12255,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,"10,000."
12256,dontos hollard,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,Wait!
12257,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,"Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?"
12258,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,I didn't murder anyone.
12259,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,"I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder."
12260,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,Why did you kill him?
12261,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
12262,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,He saved me.
12263,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,"Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever."
12264,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,He was helping me because I saved his life.
12265,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,"Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard."
12266,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?
12267,sansa stark,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,We're all liars here.
12268,petyr baelish,4,33,breaker of chains,Unnamed Scene_53,"Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home."
12269,margaery tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1,So am I the queen?
12270,olenna tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1,"More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue."
12271,margaery tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1,"Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible."
12272,olenna tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1,"The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it."
12273,margaery tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1,What was it like?
12274,olenna tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1,They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
12275,margaery tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1,One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
12276,olenna tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1,"Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that."
12277,margaery tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1,But I would have been the queen.
12278,olenna tyrell,4,33,breaker of chains,EXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY_1,Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
12279,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
12280,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,I'm not trying to trick you.
12281,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,It means I'll become king.
12282,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,"Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?"
12283,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,A good king?
12284,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,"Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?"
12285,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,This is hardly the place or the time.
12286,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Holiness?
12287,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
12288,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Justice.
12289,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
12290,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,No.
12291,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,No.
12292,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,What about strength?
12293,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,"Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?"
12294,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Wisdom.
12295,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Yes!
12296,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Wisdom is what makes a good king.
12297,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
12298,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,No.
12299,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,"No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?"
12300,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,A king needs a queen.
12301,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,"Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?"
12302,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Yes.
12303,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,"Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?"
12304,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.
12305,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,How are you?
12306,tommen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,I'm all right.
12307,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,You are. You will be. I'll see to that.
12308,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
12309,high septon,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,"Yes, my lord. All of you."
12310,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,"It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he..."
12311,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,I don't know what I saw.
12312,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.
12313,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
12314,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,"I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. (CRYING) Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy."
12315,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
12316,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,"Jaime, not here, please. Please."
12317,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Stop it. Stop it. Stop.
12318,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,No.
12319,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Stop it. Stop.
12320,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,Stop.  Stop. It's not right.
12321,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,(GRUNTS)
12322,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,It's not right. It's not right.
12323,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,I don't care.
12324,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,(CRYING)  Don't.
12325,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,I don't care.
12326,cersei lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,"Don't. Jaime, don't."
12327,jaime lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY_1,I don't care.
12328,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,Gonna rain soon. Where are we?
12329,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,"Near Fairmarket, I think."
12330,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,You think? You don't have a map?
12331,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,"No, I don't have a map."
12332,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,Maybe we should get one.
12333,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.
12334,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,How far is it to the Eyrie?
12335,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,Far.
12336,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,And you're sure we're going the right way?
12337,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,"Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way."
12338,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,On your way where?
12339,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,"Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me."
12340,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,I'd like to see Braavos one day.
12341,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,Why Braavos?
12342,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,I have friends there.
12343,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,I doubt it.
12344,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,Seven blessings to you.
12345,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,What do you want?
12346,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,What do I want? This is my land.
12347,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,"If I'm standing on it, it's my land."
12348,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
12349,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,(nods)
12350,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,He's never been the same.
12351,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,Which house did he fight for?
12352,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,The Tullys of Riverrun.
12353,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT_1,"There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it."
12354,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
12355,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,You got to do all seven of the fuckers?
12356,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,Father!
12357,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
12358,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
12359,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,I'm so sorry.
12360,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,Really good.
12361,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,Did you fight at the Twins?
12362,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
12363,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
12364,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,Guest right don't mean much anymore.
12365,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,"It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour."
12366,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,You got any ale?
12367,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,Afraid not.
12368,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,How can a man not keep ale in his home?
12369,farmer hamlet,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,"You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense."
12370,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?
12371,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,FARMER'S HOME._1,(Nods) Fair wages for fair work.
12372,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,What did you do?!
12373,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,Get your horse saddled.
12374,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,You told me you weren't a thief.
12375,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,I wasn't.
12376,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,He took us in. He fed us and you...
12377,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,"Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter."
12378,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,You don't know that.
12379,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.
12380,arya stark,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
12381,sandor clegane,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
12382,ranger,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.
12384,janos slynt,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,Going to visit your wildling whore?
12385,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,She's not a whore.
12386,janos slynt,4,33,breaker of chains,BARN_1,No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.
12387,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,They all think I'm lying.
12388,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,About what?
12389,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,Killing the white Walker.
12390,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,You're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed.
12391,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...
12392,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,A what?
12393,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"Well, a wildling."
12394,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,My father hated that word.
12395,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"It's not a very nice word, I suppose."
12396,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?"
12397,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,So... are you all right? No one bothering you?
12398,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.
12399,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,I worry about it sometimes. All the time.
12400,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,Why do you worry about it?
12401,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"100 men, one woman."
12402,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,They've got other things to think about.
12403,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,That's the only thing they think about.
12404,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,You're being silly.
12405,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
12406,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,What about you?
12407,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.
12408,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,Thank you.
12409,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,For what?
12410,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,For worrying about me.
12411,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep."
12412,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,So what are you saying?
12413,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
12414,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,Are you bored of me?
12415,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.
12416,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.
12417,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,Your Grace.
12418,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?
12419,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,Joffrey?
12420,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
12421,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night..."
12422,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,What progress have you made?
12423,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.
12424,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,House Peasebury.
12425,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,House Musgood.
12426,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,House Musgood.
12427,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,And House Haigh.
12428,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
12429,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company."
12430,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,The Golden Company?
12431,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,They've never broken a contract.
12432,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,They're sellswords.
12433,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground."
12434,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,We don't have any gold.
12435,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,Not yet.
12436,stannis baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -"
12437,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,You're late.
12438,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"I'm sorry, Princess."
12439,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,I thought you weren't coming.
12440,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.
12441,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"You won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say ""ka-nigit."""
12442,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"That happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you."
12443,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words. But I think you can manage.
12444,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,You'll never read well if you move your lips. That's how children do it.
12445,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"""The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas. First Sword of Braavos."""
12446,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,Thank you very much.
12447,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates. You were a pirate once.
12448,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler."
12449,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,What's the difference?
12450,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right."
12451,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,My father says a criminal is a criminal.
12452,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.
12453,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,You've sailed to Braavos?
12454,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,"Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction..."
12455,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,What was that for?
12456,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,I need you to write a message.
12457,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,You should write it yourself. It's good practice.
12458,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.
12459,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.
12460,shireen baratheon,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,But that's not you.
12461,davos seaworth,4,33,breaker of chains,: CASTLE BLACK_1,I need to get their attention. Go on. Write.

12475,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
12476,mole's town madam,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Could find other work for her, too."
12477,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,No other work.
12478,mole's town madam,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,There'd be money. Give you a piece of it.

12480,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?
12481,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,You protected me north of the Wall.
12482,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's."
12483,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,You have to trust me. It's for the best.
12484,gilly,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Best for you.
12485,sam,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Oh, Gilly. Please don't."
12486,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Greedy.
12487,ellaria sand,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,No?
12488,olyvar,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste."
12489,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?
12490,ellaria sand,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you."
12491,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Your loss.
12492,olyvar,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,You like them both the same? Boys and girls?
12493,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Does that surprise you?
12494,olyvar,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Everyone has a preference.
12495,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides."
12496,olyvar,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.
12497,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"What are you, 25?"
12498,ellaria sand,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Children.
12499,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"(CHUCKLES) Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day."
12500,olyvar,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Did you?
12501,ellaria sand,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
12502,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,They will all have to line up behind you.
12503,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Prince Oberyn.
12504,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Lord Tywin.
12505,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,May we have the room?
12506,ellaria sand,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Call my name if you need me, lover."
12507,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Would you like to sit?
12508,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"No, thank you."
12509,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Some wine?
12510,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"No, thank you."
12511,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,I'm sorry about your grandson.
12512,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Are you?
12513,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.
12514,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Which way is that?
12515,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?"
12516,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Some believe the king choked.
12517,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.
12518,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
12519,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,I did. This is why I know.
12520,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning."
12521,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
12522,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
12523,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,You think we conspired together?
12524,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,What did you discuss?
12525,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,The death of my sister.
12526,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,For which you blame me.
12527,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.
12528,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?"
12529,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow."
12530,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
12531,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
12532,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Categorically.
12533,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,I would like to speak with the Mountain.
12534,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
12535,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
12536,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,I could arrange for this meeting.
12537,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,But you want something in return.
12538,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third."
12539,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Why?
12540,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies."
12541,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting."
12542,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
12543,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin."
12544,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons."
12545,oberyn martell,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.
12546,tywin lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
12547,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Podrick. Apologies for the stench.
12548,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me."
12549,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,A noble effort.
12550,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese."
12551,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
12552,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"I've heard nothing, my lord."
12553,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
12554,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
12555,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
12556,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"No, my lord. You didn't?"
12557,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?"
12558,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Your father.
12559,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Of course.
12560,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Mace Tyrell.
12561,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
12562,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
12563,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
12564,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf."
12565,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa."
12566,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"My lord, she's gone."
12567,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Gone?
12568,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...
12569,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick."
12570,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Yes, my lord?"
12571,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,They'll be following you now.
12572,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Who will?
12573,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
12574,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Any other witnesses, my lord?"
12575,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
12576,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,He's already been called as a witness for the queen.
12577,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
12578,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you."
12579,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Why not?
12580,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
12581,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
12582,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"I'll ask, my lord."
12583,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler."
12584,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
12585,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"I didn't tell them anything, my lord."
12586,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Are you going to accept their offer?
12587,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,My lord.
12588,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."
12589,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"You've been good to me, my lord."
12590,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that."
12591,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"I already gave them an answer, my lord."
12592,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted."
12593,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,My lord.
12594,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell."
12595,podrick payne,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,"Farewell, my lord."
12596,tyrion lannister,4,33,breaker of chains,MOLE'S TOWN_1,Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.
12597,olly,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,Mother says it's time to eat.
12598,guymon,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.
12599,olly,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,Potatoes.
12600,guymon,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,"Potatoes. Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom. Has she got..."
12602,olly's mother,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,Guymon! (to OLLY) Hide. Hide!
12603,styr,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,You know how to get to Castle Black?
12604,olly,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,Yes. Yes.
12605,styr,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,Those your parents? Open your eyes. I'm going to eat them. Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa. Go tell the crows at Castle Black.
12606,denys mallister,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.
12608,denys mallister,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall. Seems like that would be a good lesson.
12611,aemon,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,We have just over 100 men. And that's including stewards and builders. And me. We can't afford to lose a single man. We must remember our first responsibility. We are the watchers on the Wall.
12612,pypar,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,There's got to be a way to protect them.
12614,jon snow,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,"Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them."
12616,pypar,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,Rangers returning.
12617,jon snow,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,Help him.
12618,dolorous edd,4,33,breaker of chains,THE NORTH_15,Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.
12619,alliser thorne,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1,What took you so long?
12620,grenn,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1,We were held up.
12621,alliser thorne,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1,By what?
12622,grenn,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1,Chains.
12623,dolorous edd,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1,We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.
12624,jon snow,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1,And the mutineers stayed?
12625,dolorous edd,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1,They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
12626,jon snow,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1,We need to ride north and kill them all.
12627,alliser thorne,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1,"We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait."
12628,jon snow,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1,"It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them."
12629,pypar,4,33,breaker of chains,The courtyard._1,I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
12630,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,Are they attacking?
12631,jorah mormont,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.
12632,champion,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,(SPEAKING VALYRIAN)
12633,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,What is he doing?
12634,barristan selmy,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,I believe he means to...
12635,missandei,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,"He says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole."
12636,barristan selmy,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,"Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words."
12637,jorah mormont,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
12638,champion,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,(CONTINUES SPEAKING VALYRIAN)
12639,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,"I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?"
12640,grey worm,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,"(SPEAKING VALYRIAN) Allow me this honor, mother of dragons. I will not disappoint you."
12641,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,(valyrian) You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.
12642,barristan selmy,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,"Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive."
12643,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,Which is why you must remain by my side.
12644,jorah mormont,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,"I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well."
12645,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,"You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life."
12646,daario naharis,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,"I was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you."
12647,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.
12648,missandei,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,"He is very brave, Your Grace."
12649,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,"Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching."
12650,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,You sure you don't want a horse?
12651,daario naharis,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,Why would I want a horse?
12652,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,Horses are faster than men.
12653,daario naharis,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,Horses are dumber than men.
12654,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,(valyrian) I am Daenerys Stormborn.
12655,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,"(valyrian) Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you."
12656,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!
12657,daenerys targaryen,4,33,breaker of chains,ESSOS_7,Fire!

12661,missandei,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_54,(speaks Valyrian) I am from an island called Naath.
12662,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_54,(speaks Valyrian) When they took you?
12663,missandei,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_54,"""When did they take me?"" I was five years old."
12664,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_54,You remember your home?
12665,missandei,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_54,I remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home?
12666,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_54,"(Shakes his head.) Unsullied. Always Unsullied. Before Unsullied, nothing."
12667,missandei,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_54,That's not true. Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
12668,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_54,I don't want return. (Speaks Valyrian.)
12669,missandei,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_54,Kill the masters.

12674,daenerys targaryen,4,34,oathkeeper,Unnamed Scene_54,You'll have to continue later. It's time.
12675,mossador,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,(speaking Valyrian.) You heard her! She said she came to free us.
12676,elder meereen slave,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,(speaking Valyrian.)  You are a fool. The masters are too strong.
12677,mossador,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,(speaking Valyrian.) She will protect us. She defeated the masters' champion.
12678,mossador,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,(speaking Valyrian.) She has a great army. You want to live the rest of your days in chains?
12680,elder meereen slave,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,"(speaking Valyrian.) I've been through two slave revolts, boy. They always end the same way"
12681,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,(speaking Valyrian.)  All men must die.
12682,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,"(speaking Valyrian.) But I promise you, a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains."
12683,elder meereen slave,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,(speaking Valyrian.) Who are you?
12684,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,"(speaking Valyrian.) This one is called Grey Worm. I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied. Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains."
12685,elder meereen slave,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,(speaking Valyrian.) You are Unsullied? They taught you how to fight before you could walk. We are not soldiers.
12687,grey worm,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,"(speaking Valyrian.) There are three slaves in this city for every Master. No one can give you your freedom, brothers. If you want it, you must take it."
12692,daenerys targaryen,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,"Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?"
12693,jorah mormont,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,"163, Khaleesi."
12694,daenerys targaryen,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,"Yes, that was it."

12697,daenerys targaryen,4,34,oathkeeper,Meereen slave's quarters._1,I will answer injustice with justice.
12698,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,What the hell was that?
12699,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
12700,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway."
12701,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
12702,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,You talk to my brother this way?
12703,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,All the time. He got used to it.
12704,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Do you think he did it?
12705,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?"
12706,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"You haven't been to see him yet, eh?"
12707,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,We're done for today.
12708,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
12709,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
12710,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?
12711,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months."
12712,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Is that supposed to make me feel better?
12713,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
12714,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?"
12715,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
12716,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Her son?
12717,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Don't. You know what's coming?
12718,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed."
12719,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"Now that you mention it, she did ask."
12720,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"So, should I turn around and close my eyes?"
12721,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Depends. Did you do it?
12722,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
12723,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
12724,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"Well, you could set me free."
12725,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,You know I can't.
12726,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Then there's really nothing else to say.
12727,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
12728,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate."
12729,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
12730,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Except I didn't do it.
12731,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my head's on a spike."
12732,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
12733,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
12734,tyrion lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway."
12735,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Where are you taking me?
12736,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
12737,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Did you kill Joffrey?
12738,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
12739,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,I know it was you.
12740,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,And who helped me with this conspiracy?
12741,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king."
12742,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Why not?
12743,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
12744,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Then perhaps it was your husband.
12745,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,No.
12746,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,How do you know?
12747,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,I just do.
12748,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
12749,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal."
12750,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."
12751,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?"
12752,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
12753,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,And what do you want?
12754,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?"
12755,sansa stark,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Who could trust you?
12756,petyr baelish,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong."
12757,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.
12758,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs."
12759,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,(laughs)
12760,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Have you been to see Tommen yet?
12761,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
12762,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."
12763,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,(laughs)
12764,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,How absentminded of me.
12765,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Mm-hmm.
12766,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk."
12767,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,(laughs)
12768,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."
12769,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"Well, he could have done."
12770,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"He could have done,but he didn't."
12771,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"You don't know, Grandmother."
12772,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?"
12773,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,What? I don't understand.
12774,olenna tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
12775,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Bring it through! And again.
12776,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Very nice. Good.
12777,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
12778,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Let's see what you can do.
12779,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"Olly, you just watch for now."
12780,olly,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,I can fight.
12781,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.
12782,olly,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,I was!
12783,grenn,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn."
12784,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"You two. Take it slow,  try and disarm each other."
12785,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
12786,locke,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,He wouldn't have learned anything that way.
12788,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Grenn and I were helping them.
12789,alliser thorne,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,"Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't."
12790,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,Someone has to train them.
12793,janos slynt,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,The bastard's well-liked.You're not.
12795,janos slynt,4,34,oathkeeper,The shores of Meeeen._1,For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
12796,locke,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn."
12797,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
12798,locke,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Name's Locke.
12799,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Jon Snow.
12800,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,You fight well.
12801,locke,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
12803,locke,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Guess I was wrong.
12804,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"You sent for me, Your Grace?"
12805,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
12806,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
12807,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
12808,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
12809,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
12810,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,What?
12811,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
12812,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
12813,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,She hoped or did you promise?
12814,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her."
12815,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
12816,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?
12817,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?"
12818,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?"
12819,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
12820,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I had to see him. I had to know for myself.
12821,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,And?
12822,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"He didn't do it, Cersei."
12823,cersei lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander."
12824,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Ser Pounce?
12825,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,How did you get past the Kingsguard?
12826,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Kingsguard.
12827,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
12828,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride."
12829,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?"
12830,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Yes. But if my mother found out...
12831,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace..."
12832,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Yes? Tell me a secret.
12833,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
12834,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,That's Ser Pounce.
12835,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Very handsome.
12836,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
12837,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.
12838,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,No. I don't think I am.
12839,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?
12840,tommen baratheon,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"We say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast."
12841,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then."
12842,margaery tyrell,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"Remember, our little secret."

12844,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.
12845,brienne of tarth,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Valyrian steel.
12846,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Mmm. It's yours.
12847,brienne of tarth,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I can't accept this.
12848,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you."
12849,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I hope I got your measurements right.
12850,brienne of tarth,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.
12851,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I almost forgot. I have one more gift.
12852,brienne of tarth,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I don't need a squire.
12853,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Of course you do.
12854,brienne of tarth,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,He'll slow me down.
12855,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.
12856,podrick payne,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"I won't slow you down, ser... my lady. I promise I'll serve you well."
12857,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.
12858,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.
12859,bronn,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse."
12860,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?
12861,brienne of tarth,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Oathkeeper.
12862,jaime lannister,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"Good-bye, Brienne."
12863,podrick payne,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"Come on, move."
12864,sam,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I should neverhave taken her away.
12865,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,She wasn't safe here.
12866,sam,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next."
12867,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Castle Black could be next.
12868,sam,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I should go back for Gilly.
12869,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
12870,sam,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
12871,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him."
12872,sam,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did."
12873,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
12874,sam,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.
12875,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...
12876,sam,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...
12877,locke,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Snow. I don't mean to interrupt. Thorne wants to see you.
12879,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"Thank you, Ser Alliser."
12880,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"Ahem, brothers."
12881,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?"
12882,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
12883,locke,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"Then let me say my vows. If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how."
12885,jon snow,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"Thank you, brothers."
12888,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.
12889,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"Any command for us, Lord Commander? What's that? Fuck 'em till they're dead?"
12890,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"Did you hear that, boys? Fuck 'em till they're dead."
12891,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Rast.
12892,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Go outside and feed the beast.
12893,rast,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,We should kill that thing.
12894,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"You should shuty our fucking hole, ugly little cunt. You look likea fucking ballsack. Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face. I could piss in any gutte rand soak five of you. Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing? Seven silvers. They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again. None of them cocksuckers got away from me."
12895,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"Haven't lost a fight since I was nine. Maybe it's time. What do you think, eh?"
12896,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"Maybe you're the man. Eh, cunt?"
12897,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,"I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley. A fucking legend! I would take any knight... any knight, any time. Fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards."
12899,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,What the fuck is that?
12900,sissy,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Craster's last child. A boy.
12901,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,What am I supposed to do with him? What did Craster do with 'em? Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him? All right.
12902,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Don't need another mouth to feed. Hand him over.
12903,sissy,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,He didn't kill them. He offered them.
12904,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,To who?
12905,sissy,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,To the gods. The white walkers.
12907,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Shut up!
12908,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,So... if it worked for him... Let's give the walkers what they want.
12909,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,the yard armory_1,Rast is headed that way.

12915,jojen reed,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,It's coming.
12916,bran stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,I'm going out there.
12917,meera reed,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,"No, we need to stay together."
12918,bran stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,I'm going.
12919,jojen reed,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,Bran. Bran.

12921,meera reed,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,"Bran, what happened?"
12922,bran stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,"Summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap."
12923,meera reed,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,Who?
12924,bran stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,"I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf. They have Ghost."
12925,bran stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,They're Night's Watch. Look. Jon might be here.
12926,meera reed,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,"If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?"
12927,meera reed,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,"They might have been Night'sWatch once, not anymore. We're not safe here.We need to go."
12928,bran stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,No.
12929,meera reed,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,"Bran, we need to go now."
12930,bran stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,I'm not leaving without Summer.
12931,meera reed,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,Can you remember where the cage was?
12932,bran stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,The east side of the keep.
12933,meera reed,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,"If I'm not backsoon, we'll meet..."
12934,hodor,4,34,oathkeeper,Bran's camp_1,Hodor.
12935,hodor,4,34,oathkeeper,inside the keep._1,Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.

12938,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,Help him up.
12939,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,This is nice. Fine leather. You're no wildling. Important. Highborn. Who are you?
12940,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,"You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand. But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods. Isn't that a bit odd?"
12941,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,I like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?
12942,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,"See you haven't played this game before. A highborn hostage, that's valuable. But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed."
12943,rast,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,What the fuck's wrong with him?
12944,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,Come here.
12945,meera reed,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,"(screams) No, please. Please.Please, let me help him."
12946,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,Who are you?
12947,meera reed,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,Please.
12948,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,Who are you?
12949,bran stark,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,I'm Brandon Stark! I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
12950,rast,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,It's Jon Snow's brother.
12951,meera reed,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,It's Meera. It's Meera.I'm right here.
12952,tanner,4,34,oathkeeper,Interior of the Keep_1,And I thought this was gonnabe another boring day.

12967,margaery tyrell,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1","No, he wasn't."
12968,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1",You still mourn for Joffrey?

12974,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1","The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it."
12975,margaery tyrell,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1","It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there."
12976,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1",He will need help... if he's going to rule well.

13004,jorah mormont,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1",You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.
13005,daenerys targaryen,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1",You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.

The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand."
13017,knight,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1",Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
13018,petyr baelish,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1","Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece, Alayne."
13019,knight,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1",Stand to.
13022,knight,4,35,first of his name,"THE SEPT, LATER_1","Welcome back, Lord Baelish."
13023,robin arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",Uncle Petyr!
13024,petyr baelish,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",My lord.
13025,petyr baelish,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",Oh. I have brought you a gift.
13026,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",Lord Baelish.
13027,petyr baelish,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",My lady.
13028,robin arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
13029,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
13030,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al..."
13031,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me."
13032,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",My flesh and blood.
13033,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa."
13034,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
13035,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",Of course. I understand.
13036,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.
13037,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",I would never say a thing.
13038,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.
13039,robin arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
13040,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","They did, and my father's."
13041,robin arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't."
13042,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",Make him fly?
13043,robin arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",Through the Moon Door.
13044,robin arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",(giggles)
13045,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll."
13046,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
13047,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?
13048,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",No. We never...
13049,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin."
13050,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin."
13051,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","Robin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs."
13052,petyr baelish,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",Go. We'll speak soon.
13053,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",What took you so long?
13054,petyr baelish,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive."
13055,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
13056,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",Let's get married tonight.
13057,petyr baelish,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
13058,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me."
13059,petyr baelish,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",I do think that we could wait until...
13060,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?"
13061,petyr baelish,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",Like it was yesterday.
13062,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husband's wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters..."
13063,petyr baelish,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
13064,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",(nods)
13065,petyr baelish,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","Tonight it is, then."
13066,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1",(laughs)
13067,petyr baelish,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately."
13068,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"THE EYRIE, THRONE ROOM_1","I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea."
13069,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",When will the wedding take place in your mind?
13070,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
13071,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",A fortnight?
13072,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",That seems reasonable.
13073,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals."
13074,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",(shakes her head)
13075,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",And your wedding to Loras?
13076,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Shortly after Tommen's.
13077,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Shortly?
13078,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",A fortnight.
13079,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
13080,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",We had that in common.
13081,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
13082,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Then whom can we trust?
13083,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Ourselves alone.
13084,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
13085,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Robert wasn't particularly rich.
13086,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
13087,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
13088,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
13089,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Haven't a clue.
13090,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Go on, your best guess."
13091,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Pounds, tons, ounces?"
13092,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
13093,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",That can't be.
13094,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
13095,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Then how do we pay for anything?
13096,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
13097,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",How much?
13098,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",A tremendous amount.
13099,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement."
13100,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
13101,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
13102,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect."
13103,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do."
13104,tywin lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you."
13105,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
13106,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
13107,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
13108,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Would you shut up?
13109,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I can't sleep until I say the names.
13110,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
13111,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Only the ones I'm going to kill.
13112,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","(chuckles) Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list."
13113,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","If he were here right now, what would you do?"
13114,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men."
13115,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I'm almost done. Only one name left.
13116,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Go on.
13117,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",The Hound.
13118,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Thank you.
13119,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?"
13120,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Really?
13121,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat."
13122,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food."
13123,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?"
13124,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
13125,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder."
13126,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Yes. I'm very lucky.
13127,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",He feels responsible for you.
13128,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful."
13129,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?
13130,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much."
13131,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Loved your mother.
13132,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",No.
13133,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",That's what you wanted to say.
13134,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you."
13135,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?"
13136,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",No.
13137,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?
13138,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","No, never."
13139,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Are you pregnant?
13140,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-"
13141,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?
13142,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Aunt Lysa, no, I-"
13143,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Your young, pretty body."
13144,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Nothing. I'm a virgin.
13145,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Don't lie to me.
13146,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",You're hurting me.
13147,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I'll know if you lie.
13148,sansa stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever."
13149,lysa arryn,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm.
13150,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?
13151,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters."
13152,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather."
13153,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",That's a long way off.
13154,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point."
13155,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Never, my lady. I'm your squire."
13156,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now.
13157,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","All knights have squires, my lady."
13158,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you."
13159,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","I swore an oath, my lady."
13160,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.
13161,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I know.
13162,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",What do you think will happen if you leave?
13163,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.
13164,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",The hell you doing?
13165,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Practicing.
13166,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","What, ways to die?"
13167,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",No one's going to kill me.
13168,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",They will if you nance around like that. That's no way to fight.
13169,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",It's not fighting. It's water dancing.
13170,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?
13171,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos."
13172,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Braavos. (SCOFFS) Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet. They all are."
13173,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",What do you know about anything?
13174,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.
13175,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",It was not.
13176,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Was? He dead?
13177,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Yes.
13178,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",How?
13179,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",He was killed.
13180,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Who by?
13181,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn-
13182,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
13183,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",He was outnumbered.
13184,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
13185,arya stark,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.
13186,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? (LAUGHS) All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends."
13187,sandor clegane,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Your friend's dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword. (SCOFFS)
13188,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Your Grace.
13189,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?
13190,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","A poem, actually."
13191,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",May I show you the gardens?
13192,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
13193,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","No, you couldn't."
13194,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I didn't realize you were a poet.
13195,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Not a very good one.
13196,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",For your paramour?
13197,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",For one of my daughters.
13198,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","You have several, don't you?"
13199,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Eight.
13200,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Eight? Eight daughters?
13201,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.
13202,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Beautiful name.
13203,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry."
13204,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?"
13205,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Which joke is that?
13206,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
13207,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",We can avenge them.
13208,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Yes, we can avenge them."
13209,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
13210,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I know he did.
13211,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
13212,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year."
13213,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun."
13214,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.
13215,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
13216,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again."
13217,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Anything at all.
13218,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.
13219,oberyn martell,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
13220,cersei lannister,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.
13221,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Oh, no, no, no."
13222,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","No, no, no, no."
13223,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Hells. Gods.
13224,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Did you remove the skin?
13225,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","No, my lady."
13226,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?
13227,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","No, my lady."
13228,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
13229,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","No, my lady. That was the cooks."
13230,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",What are you doing?
13231,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I'm helping you with your armor.
13232,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much."
13233,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?
13234,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.
13235,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?"
13236,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I killed a man.
13237,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Who?
13238,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",A Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
13239,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",How did you kill a Kingsguard?
13240,podrick payne,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
13241,brienne of tarth,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1",Bloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps.
13242,rast,4,35,first of his name,"SANSA'S ROOM, NIGHT_1","Hey. Hey, get up. Get up."
13247,meera reed,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7,You need water.
13248,jojen reed,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7,It doesn't matter.
13249,meera reed,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7,Of course it matters.
13250,jojen reed,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7,You mustn't let anything stop you.
13251,bran stark,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7,They already have stopped me.
13252,jojen reed,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7,No. You're not here. You're far from here.
13253,meera reed,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7,What does that mean?
13254,jojen reed,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7,At the hill. A great weirwood tree.
13255,bran stark,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7,"You've seen it, too."
13256,jojen reed,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7,"Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. We have to find it. You have to make it."
13257,bran stark,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7,We will.
13258,jojen reed,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7,This... this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.
13259,meera reed,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7,How... will we know the end?
13260,jojen reed,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_7,You'll know.
13261,locke,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9,Brothers.
13262,dolorous edd,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9,You do move quiet.
13263,jon snow,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9,How many?
13264,locke,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9,Eleven men. Most of them already drunk. No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world. We'll carve them up like walnut pie.
13265,grenn,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9,Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom. I've seen what he can do with a knife.
13266,locke,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9,Have you seen what I can do with a knife?
13267,grenn,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9,(chuckles) Not yet.
13268,locke,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9,There's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.
13269,jon snow,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9,Why?
13270,locke,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9,"They've got some hounds chained up inside. Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better."
13271,grenn,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9,New moon tonight.
13272,jon snow,4,35,first of his name,CRASTER'S KEEP_9,(sighs) Get some rest. We move at sundown.
13273,karl tanner,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7",I've always liked a girl with curls. A touch of class. You take whatever's left.
13274,karl tanner,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7",Get her up.
13275,bran stark,4,35,first of his name,"CRASTER'S KEEP, NIGHT_7",Stop.

13364,stannis baratheon,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,It's not a story. It's the truth.
13365,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,The king's grandfather tells a different story. A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
13366,stannis baratheon,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,Gold you loaned him.
13367,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
13368,stannis baratheon,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,More than any man living.
13369,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,"Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like ""usurper"" and ""madman"" and ""blood right."" Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?"
13370,stannis baratheon,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,"4,000."
13371,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,"And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay."
13372,davos seaworth,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,32.
13373,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,"And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?"
13374,stannis baratheon,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,None.
13375,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.
13376,davos seaworth,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,My lord.
13377,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,"I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles."
13378,davos seaworth,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,"Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another.  {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers."
13379,davos seaworth,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,"This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive."
13380,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,The war is over.
13381,davos seaworth,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,"As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?"
13382,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,Ser Davos...
13383,davos seaworth,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,Humor me.
13384,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,Tywin Lannister.
13386,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,67.
13387,stannis baratheon,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,"67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?"
13388,tycho nestoris,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,That is a problem for another time.
13389,davos seaworth,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Opulent Braavos chamber_1,"Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it."

13405,davos seaworth,4,36,the laws of gods and men,Braavosi bathhouse._1,There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house. I gave it to your wife.

13524,varys,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.
13525,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,And yet everyone does.
13526,varys,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?
13527,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Five years.
13528,varys,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,May I ask why?
13529,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,'Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.
13530,varys,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Most of us aren't princes.
13531,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,You are from Essos. Where? Lys?
13532,varys,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.
13533,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?
13534,varys,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,It's a long story.
13535,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,One you don't like telling people.
13536,varys,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,People I trust.
13537,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but..."
13538,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,You did like boys before?
13539,varys,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,(shakes his head)
13540,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
13541,varys,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either."
13542,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,What then?
13543,varys,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Nothing.
13544,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Everybody is interested in something.
13545,varys,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,"Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things."
13546,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_1,Such as?
13547,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,TYRION's cell_1,"Let me guess, I've been pardoned."
13548,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,TYRION's cell_1,Really?
13549,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,TYRION's cell_1,Father's orders.
13550,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,TYRION's cell_1,"Well, we mustn't disappoint Father."
13552,tommen baratheon,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1","I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial. Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead. And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell. And if found guilty... may the gods punish the accused."
13553,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1","Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?"

13555,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1","Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?"
13556,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1",Not that I know of.
13557,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1","How would you say he died, then?"
13558,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1",Choked on his pigeon pie.
13559,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1",So you would blame the bakers?
13560,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room_1",Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
13562,meryn trant,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._1","Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed."
13563,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._1","Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?"
13564,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._1",Silence.
13565,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._1",Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.

13569,pycelle,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3","Had, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered."
13570,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3",By whom?
13571,pycelle,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3","By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned."
13572,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3","Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?"
13573,pycelle,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3",Without question.
13574,pycelle,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3","This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool. He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast. She wore this necklace the day of the wedding. Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside."
13575,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3",Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
13576,pycelle,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._3",It was. The Strangler. A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.

13579,cersei lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._5","(Nods.) Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops."
13580,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._5","Tyrion said, ""And you will know the debt is paid."" What debt?"
13581,cersei lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._5",I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.

13585,varys,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7","I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, ""Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."""
13586,mace tyrell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
13587,varys,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
13589,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7","Father, may I ask the witness one question?"
13590,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",One.
13591,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7","You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?"

13598,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
13599,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",I know nothing of the sort.
13600,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",You've always hated Tyrion.
13601,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",He killed his king.
13602,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
13603,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
13604,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",Justice?
13605,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7","I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly."
13606,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",He'll be executed.
13607,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7","No, he'll be punished accordingly."
13608,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7","Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line."
13609,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",I'm well aware of your oath.
13610,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?

13612,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
13613,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",Done.
13614,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7","When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again."
13615,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",You have my word.
13616,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,"The throne room, a bit later._7",And you have mine.
13617,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,"Not going well, is it?"
13618,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,You're going to be found guilty.
13619,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,"Oh, you think so?"
13620,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,"When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch."
13621,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
13622,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
13623,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,How do you know?
13624,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,Do you trust me?
13625,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,(nods)
13626,jaime lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.
13627,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,The crown may call its next witness.

13630,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
13631,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,I swear it.

13633,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
13634,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,How do you know him?
13635,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
13636,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?
13637,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,I know that he's guilty.
13638,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,He and Sansa planned it together.
13639,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,Silence! Continue.
13640,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,"She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord."
13641,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
13642,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
13643,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.
13644,mace tyrell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,I beg your pardon? You said you were his...
13645,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,His whore.
13646,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,How did you come to be in his service?
13647,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,"He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. ""You belong to me now,"" he said. ""I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."""
13648,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,Silence. Silence!
13649,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,And did you?
13650,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,Did I what?
13651,oberyn martell,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
13652,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,"I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him ""my lion,"" so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, ""I am yours and you are mine."""
13653,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,Shae. Please don't.
13654,shae,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,"I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her."
13655,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,"Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess."
13656,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,You wish to confess?
13657,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
13658,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?
13659,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,"Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?"
13660,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,You admit you poisoned the king?
13661,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,"No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf."
13662,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
13663,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,"Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life."
13664,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,Have you nothing to say in your defense?
13665,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,"Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had."
13666,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,"(To Cersei) Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores."
13667,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,(To the crowd) I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
13668,tywin lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
13669,tyrion lannister,4,36,the laws of gods and men,The Iron Throne room_3,I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.
13670,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
13671,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?"
13672,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"
13673,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it."
13674,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You fell in love with a whore.
13675,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
13676,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
13677,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,At least I got to tell them what they really are.
13678,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."
13679,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
13680,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
13681,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
13682,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,(laughs)
13683,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
13684,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,It is tempting.
13685,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life."
13686,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,If he wins.
13687,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
13688,jaime lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,No. Not Ser Meryn.
13692,cersei lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.
13693,cersei lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You seem to be in good form.
13694,gregor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Who am I fighting?
13695,cersei lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Does it matter?
13696,gregor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,(Shakes his head.)
13697,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Could be food.
13698,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Could be soldiers.
13699,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
13700,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down."
13701,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Who were ""they""?"
13702,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I stopped asking a while ago.
13703,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,That's not gonna get better.
13704,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Doesn't seem so.
13705,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?
13706,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.
13707,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,So why go on?
13708,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Habit.
13709,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Nothing could be worse than this.
13710,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Maybe nothing is worse than this.
13711,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.
13712,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Who are you?
13713,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,My name is Arya. Arya Stark.
13714,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You her father?
13715,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,(Shakes his head.) Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
13716,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work."
13717,dying man,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Wish it were wine.
13718,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,So do I.
13719,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.
13720,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,The fuck you doing?
13721,rorge,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,There's a price on your head.
13722,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
13723,rorge,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.
13724,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?"
13725,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
13726,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?
13727,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,He can't be. I don't know his name.
13728,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,What's your name?
13729,rorge,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Rorge.
13730,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Thank you.
13731,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You're learning.
13735,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Greetings.
13737,sam,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"All right, Jon?"
13739,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Lord Snow.
13740,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.
13741,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Come on, Ghost."
13742,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
13743,janos slynt,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?"
13744,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,We need to prepare.
13745,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,We've been preparing.
13746,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
13747,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,And how would we range north?
13748,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,We wouldn't.
13749,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?"
13750,grenn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,We can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.
13751,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel."
13752,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have."
13753,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.
13754,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,They won't stop them.
13755,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow."
13756,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,The stewards.
13757,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
13758,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,No.
13759,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Who would that be?
13760,jon snow,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,The builders.
13761,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?"
13762,othell yarwyck,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,(Pauses.) No.
13763,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Given your deep knowledge of the Wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon."
13764,alliser thorne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Moving on. First Builder, we'll need a hundred barrels of pitch brought atop the wall."
13765,othell yarwyck,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Aye.
13766,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,My lord.
13767,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You have new clothes.
13768,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
13769,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I sent for you days ago.
13770,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I've been a bit busy.
13771,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Doing what?
13772,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
13773,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
13774,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
13775,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,She's dim-witted.
13776,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"If I wanted wits, I'd marry you."
13777,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?"
13778,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister."
13779,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,And you understand the rules of inheritance?
13780,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Falyse is forty and barren.
13781,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
13782,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
13783,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,(scoffs.)
13784,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
13785,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
13786,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price."
13787,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Is it two wives you want or two castles?
13788,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle."
13789,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
13790,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?
13791,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
13792,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Your sister's a Lannister, too."
13793,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."
13794,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink."
13795,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Does he frighten you so much?
13796,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"
13797,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Because you're my friend.
13798,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?"
13799,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more."
13800,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I understand.
13801,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I'm sorry it has to be this way.
13802,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
13803,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,We had some good days together.
13804,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Yes, we did."
13805,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,What will you do?
13806,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
13807,bronn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I hope to hear them sing it one day.
13808,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,"
13809,daario naharis,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,But your window is not.
13810,daario naharis,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
13811,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Don't do that again.
13812,daario naharis,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.
13813,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you."
13814,daario naharis,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you."
13815,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Tell me why you're here.
13816,daario naharis,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents."
13817,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
13818,daario naharis,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You've ordered us to be night watchmen.
13819,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue."
13820,daario naharis,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"There is only one, and she does not want me."
13821,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You swore me your sword.
13822,daario naharis,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,My sword is yours till the day I die.
13823,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
13824,daario naharis,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.
13825,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Very well.
13826,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Do what you do best.
13827,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Take off your clothes.
13828,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Oh.
13829,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Come in, my queen. Please."
13830,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady."
13831,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You could never disturb me.
13832,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
13833,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
13834,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one."
13835,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, ""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count."" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid."
13836,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,It was. I- humor isn't my strength.
13837,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
13838,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?"
13839,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Not always.
13840,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lord's power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust."
13841,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Did you use it with Stannis?
13842,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
13843,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.
13844,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home."
13845,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I understand how you feel.
13846,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Hmm.
13847,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,But that is impossible.
13848,selyse baratheon,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Why?
13849,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself."
13850,melisandre,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her."
13851,daario naharis,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.
13852,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Khaleesi.
13853,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You're here early.
13854,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Later than some.
13855,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You don't approve?
13856,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust."
13857,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You neither approve nor trust.
13858,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
13859,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
13860,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I did.
13861,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I trust you.
13862,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
13863,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
13864,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You have?
13865,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I have.
13866,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control."
13867,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself."
13868,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."
13869,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
13870,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
13871,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
13872,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi."
13873,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
13874,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
13875,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
13876,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Hizdahr zo Loraq?
13877,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
13878,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,(Nods.)
13879,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind."
13880,jorah mormont,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Yes, Khaleesi."
13881,daenerys targaryen,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,No. Tell him you changed my mind.
13882,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Rat cunts. Fucking whore.
13883,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-"
13884,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,No fire.
13885,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.
13886,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,No fire!
13887,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Shut up about it. Shut up about everything. Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going."
13888,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword."
13889,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
13890,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Why?
13891,sandor clegane,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?"
13892,arya stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
13893,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
13894,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Couldn't agree more, my lady."
13895,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.
13896,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Yes, my lady."
13897,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Don't get drunk.
13898,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"No, my lady."
13899,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Can I get you anything else?
13900,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful."
13901,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Thanks. I do my best.
13902,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?"
13903,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,No.
13904,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?"
13905,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,We're looking for someone.
13906,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had seventeen-
13907,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name."
13908,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Starks? What, like them lot from ""Winterhell""?"
13909,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"No, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here."
13910,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
13911,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?
13912,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,What?
13913,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"It's nothing, my lady."
13914,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
13915,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't."
13916,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
13917,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
13918,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
13919,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,What about? Not kidney pie.
13920,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.
13921,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.
13922,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,She weren't when I last spoke to her.
13923,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,When was that?
13924,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry."
13925,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,So what happened to her?
13926,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Well-
13927,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,The quick version.
13928,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.
13929,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,The Hound.
13930,hot pie,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better."
13931,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Um, you were saying?"
13932,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun."
13933,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady."
13934,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Why the Eyrie?
13935,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who."
13936,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Sansa could be there, too."
13937,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Aye, my lady. Could be."
13938,brienne of tarth,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You sure about this?
13939,podrick payne,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,No.
13940,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
13941,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
13942,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like."
13943,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Your sister.
13944,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Oh.
13945,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.
13946,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
13947,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.
13948,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
13949,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago."
13950,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I think I would have remembered that.
13951,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you."
13952,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
13953,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy."
13954,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,That would have made things so much easier.
13955,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."""
13956,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
13957,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
13958,tyrion lannister,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
13959,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I disagree.
13960,oberyn martell,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion."
13961,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Hello, Robin."
13962,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,What are you doing?
13963,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time."
13964,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Why did you leave?
13965,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,It's a long story.
13966,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
13967,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Yes, you certainly are."
13968,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,When will you go back?
13969,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
13970,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
13971,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."
13972,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?
13973,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,We don't.
13974,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?
13975,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
13976,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door."
13977,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I like the sound of that.
13978,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
13979,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,All right.
13980,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,It can go in here in this big tower.
13981,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
13982,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I didn't ruin it.
13983,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You did.
13984,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it.
13985,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.
13986,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I didn't ruin it!
13987,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You're being stupid.
13988,robin arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I didn't ruin it!
13989,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Robin, I'm sorry, I-"
13990,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Children.
13991,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I hit him.
13992,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Yes, I saw."
13993,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I shouldn't have done that.
13994,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction."
13995,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,If he tells Aunt Lysa...
13996,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
13997,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.
13998,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one."
13999,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.
14000,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world."
14001,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You're more beautiful than she ever was.
14002,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Lord Baelish...
14003,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Call me Petyr.
14004,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?"
14005,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Come here, Sansa."
14006,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Do you know how far the fall is?
14007,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,No.
14008,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Neither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did."
14009,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen-"
14010,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Don't be coy with me, you little whore. You kissed him. You kissed Petyr."
14011,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I didn't. You don't understand.
14012,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,I saw you! You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.
14013,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,He kissed me. I pulled away.
14014,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Liar! Whore! He is mine!
14015,sansa stark,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Please!
14016,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me. Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down!"
14017,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Lysa! Let her go.
14018,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,You want her? This empty-headed child?
14019,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,Let her go.
14020,lysa arryn,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,She's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why?
14021,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa."
14022,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife."
14023,petyr baelish,4,37,mockingbird,Unnamed Scene_58,"I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister."
14026,mole's town whore,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_59,"You fucking dick! Same wrong guess every fucking time. Listen, ya cunt."
14028,mole's town whore,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_59,"There's a man with an ear. Too bad you've got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your britches down, I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?"
14029,gilly,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_59,Yes.
14030,mole's town whore,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_59,"Well, what are you going to say?"
14031,gilly,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_59,I'm sorry it woke you up.
14032,mole's town whore,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_59,"I don't care if you're sorry. Keep that baby quiet, or I will."
14033,gilly,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_59,Don't you ever touch him.
14034,mole's town whore,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_59,"Hehehe, little Wildling bitch. You should've stayed with your own kind. *an owl hoots in the distance* Are you listening to me?"
14035,gilly,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_59,Shut your mouth.
14036,mole's town whore,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_59,What? It's just an owl you dumb bitch.
14037,gilly,4,38,the mountain and the viper,Unnamed Scene_59,No it's not.
14038,sam,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,I should never have left her there.
14039,jon snow,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,You couldn't have known.
14040,sam,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,Of course I could've known. They were raiding the villages close by.
14041,grenn,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers?
14042,eddard stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.
14043,grenn,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,"Oh, so it's alright then?! Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!"
14044,eddard stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,I didn't say it was alright! I'm sayin' they shouldn't have been there.
14045,grenn,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,We pledged to guard the realms of men.
14046,sam,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,She's dead because of me.
14047,grenn,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,We can't even guard Mole's Town.
14048,jon snow,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,"We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want."
14049,sam,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.
14050,pypar,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,"Maybe she managed to hide herself. I thought one of you was dead, you went North with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did."
14051,eddard stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met. She survived the long march to the wall. She survived a white walker for fuck's sake. She might've got out.
14052,sam,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,She might have.
14053,jon snow,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,"If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close."
14054,eddard stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,A hundred thousand.
14055,grenn,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,"And there's what, 5 of us left."
14056,eddard stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,"If you're counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully. A hundred and two."
14057,pypar,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?
14058,eddard stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,CASTLE BLACK_5,"Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back."
14059,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,You think he was spying on you?
14060,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"No, not spying."
14061,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.
14062,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Yes your grace.
14063,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,But you are not Dothraki.
14064,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,No.
14065,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes."
14066,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,He was interested.
14067,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,What?
14068,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,I believe he was interested.
14069,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?"
14070,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,All of it?
14071,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,The...the pillar an the stones.
14072,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"I don't know, your grace."
14073,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Haven't you ever wondered?
14074,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"Yes, your grace."
14075,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.
14076,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,*in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.
14077,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,*in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.
14078,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,*in Valyrian* No.
14079,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"The lessons you give I in Common tongue, these are precious to I."
14080,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,To me.
14081,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,To me.
14082,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,I don't remember teaching you the word precious.
14083,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word."
14084,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Do you remember the name you were given at birth?
14085,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,I remember nothing. Only unsullied.
14086,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"When they cut you, do you remember that?"
14087,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.
14088,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,Why? Why sorry?
14089,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
14090,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,"*approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry."
14091,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,*in Valyrian* Grey Worm.
14092,missandei,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,*in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.
14093,grey worm,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_1,*in Valyrian* So am I.
14094,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?"
14095,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands."
14096,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,And what are you really?
14097,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,I'm Reek.
14098,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud."
14099,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,I'm Reek.
14100,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,Until when?
14101,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,Always. Forever.
14102,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
14104,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?"
14105,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,Yes.
14106,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,And why should I believe that?
14107,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
14109,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?"
14110,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
14111,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,And what does Lord Bolton want?
14112,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
14113,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,He wants us to surrender?
14114,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you."
14115,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,...shame fought with honor.
14116,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear..."
14117,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?
14118,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,*scared* You don't know.
14119,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,The Ironborn will not surrender.
14120,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,*whispering* Reek. Reek.
14121,ralf kenning,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?"
14122,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,Reek.
14124,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
14125,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,"You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?"
14126,theon greyjoy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
14127,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_1,I believe we will. To our new home.
14128,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally."
14129,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
14130,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce."
14131,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black."
14132,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,My lord...
14133,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn..."
14134,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
14135,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair."
14136,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
14137,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
14138,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door."
14139,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
14140,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,We were told there was a witness. A girl.
14141,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"A niece of yours, I believe."
14142,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help."
14143,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,We'd like to speak with her.
14144,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,Let me fetch her.
14145,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
14146,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room."
14147,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,My lady...
14148,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,I wasn't asking you.
14149,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,He can stay.
14150,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw."
14151,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"*to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
14152,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Please, Alayne, leave nothing out."
14153,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
14154,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?"
14155,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."
14156,vance corbray,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Your secret is safe with us, my lady."
14157,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
14158,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa."
14159,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
14160,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,Lady Sansa.
14161,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
14162,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault."
14163,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
14164,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
14165,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly."
14166,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same."
14167,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?"
14168,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl."
14169,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,Are you questioning our courage?
14170,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?"
14171,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
14172,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?"
14173,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead."
14174,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale."
14175,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
14176,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
14177,lady anya waynwood,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,More often they die young.
14178,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse."
14179,yohn royce,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Aye, it's time."
14180,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_1,"Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest."
14182,barristan selmy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Yes? Who sent you?
14183,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Ser Barristan.
14184,barristan selmy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Ser Jorah.
14185,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Have I forgotten a council meeting?
14186,barristan selmy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,No.
14187,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,What's this?
14188,barristan selmy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.
14189,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Who gave you this?
14190,barristan selmy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Does it matter?
14191,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Have you told her?
14192,barristan selmy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,"I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back."
14193,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Let me speak with her in private.
14194,barristan selmy,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,You'll never be alone with her again.
14195,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Why did the usurper pardon you?
14196,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,If we could speak alone.
14197,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,"No, speak to me here. Explain it to me."
14198,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,"Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him."
14199,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
14200,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,It is not forged.
14201,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,"Why, then?"
14202,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,"I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing."
14203,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,What was the content of these letters?
14204,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Information.
14205,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,What information?
14206,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
14207,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
14208,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,I...
14209,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Yes or no?
14210,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Khaleesi.
14211,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
14212,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Yes.
14213,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
14214,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,I stopped you from drinking his wine.
14215,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,Because you knew it was poisoned.
14216,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,I suspected.
14217,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,You betrayed me from the first.
14218,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,"Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me."
14219,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
14220,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.
14221,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,...and you want me to forgive you?
14222,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,I have loved you.
14223,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,"Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can."
14224,jorah mormont,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,"Daenerys, please."
14225,daenerys targaryen,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MEEREEN_3,"Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now."
14226,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3,"Moat Cailin is yours, Father."
14227,house bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3,Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?
14228,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3,No.
14229,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3,"Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see."
14230,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3,"Moors, fields, hills."
14231,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3,Tell me what you see.
14232,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3,Nothing.
14233,roose bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3,"Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?"
14234,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3,Ramsay Snow.
14235,roose bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3,"No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North."
14236,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3,"You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise."
14237,ramsay bolton,4,38,the mountain and the viper,MOAT CAILIN_3,"Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath."
14238,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3,Yes?
14239,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3,"First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?"
14240,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3,They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
14241,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3,That's not an answer.
14242,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3,"If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?"
14243,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3,I don't know.
14244,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3,Neither do I.
14245,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3,Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?
14246,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3,I know what you want.
14247,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_3,Do you?
14248,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,"I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy."
14249,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,Lots of things make me happy.
14250,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,Like what?
14251,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,"Killing Polliver, killing Rorge."
14252,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?
14253,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
14254,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,"Aye, nothing in the world beats that look."
14255,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
14256,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,"I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel."
14257,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
14258,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,*laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*
14259,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,You should have let me burn it.
14260,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,It's a fleabite.
14261,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
14262,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,"Well, we won't have to walk too much further."
14263,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,You really think my aunt will pay for me?
14264,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,"Aye, she'll pay."
14265,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,I've never even met her.
14266,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,"Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about."
14267,arya stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,I'm not a lady.
14269,sandor clegane,4,38,the mountain and the viper,OUTSIDE THE VALE_1,"The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn."
14271,robin arryn,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_5,"I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave."
14272,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_5,You shouldn't be.
14273,robin arryn,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_5,"The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside."
14274,petyr baelish,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_5,It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
14275,sansa stark,4,38,the mountain and the viper,THE VALE_5,Shall we go?
14276,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
14277,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Soon.
14278,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,"Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
14279,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,I've never seen him fight.
14280,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,"Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
14281,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Oberyn believes in himself.
14282,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
14283,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Beheading.
14284,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,"Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
14285,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Cousins.
14286,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,"Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
14287,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
14288,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
14290,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Nothing made him happier.
14291,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
14292,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
14293,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,"The joke wore thin, though."
14294,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,For you. You drifted away.
14295,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,I had other interests.
14296,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,"Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
14297,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Why?
14298,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,"I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
14299,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
14300,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,"Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
14301,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,"Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
14302,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,"I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
14303,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,He was twice your size.
14304,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,"He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
14305,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,I don't know.
14306,jaime lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Good luck today.
14307,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Looks like very light armor.
14308,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,I like to move around.
14309,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
14310,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
14311,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
14312,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Today is not the day I die.
14313,ellaria sand,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,You're going to fight that?
14314,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,I'm going to kill that.
14315,ellaria sand,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,He is the biggest man I've ever seen.
14316,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
14317,tyrion lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Thank the gods.
14318,pycelle,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,"In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion..."
14319,ellaria sand,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Don't leave me alone in this world.
14320,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Never.
14321,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Have they told you who I am?
14322,the mountain,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Some dead man.
14323,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
14324,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
14325,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
14326,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
14327,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,You raped her! You murdered her!
14328,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,You killed her children!
14329,oberyn martell,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,"Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!"
14330,the mountain,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!
14331,tywin lannister,4,38,the mountain and the viper,KING'S LANDING_25,"*standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death.1Embed"
14332,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,What was she like?
14333,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,She...she had red hair.
14334,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Oh? How big were her feet?
14335,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Well what do you want me to say?
14336,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
14337,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,So you and Gilly never-
14338,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
14339,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"But if she had, you would've? You'd have broken your vows?"
14340,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women."
14341,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,What?
14342,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"""I shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation."
14343,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
14344,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?"
14345,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
14346,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"No, you're really not."
14347,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
14348,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
14349,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,There will.
14350,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
14351,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch."
14352,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?
14353,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Yes.
14354,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--"
14355,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.
14356,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,We could be waiting here a while.
14357,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting."
14358,styr,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.
14359,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon."
14360,styr,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.
14361,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I probably killed him already.
14362,styr,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,So you've said.
14363,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
14364,styr,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
14365,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?"
14366,styr,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Maybe I have.
14367,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me."
14368,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?"
14369,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Maester Aemon. How did you know-
14370,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
14371,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Let me help you.
14372,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?"
14373,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Maester Faull
14374,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library."
14375,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
14376,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
14377,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I don't love her.
14378,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Yes you do.
14379,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,No.
14380,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.
14381,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,You were?
14382,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?"
14383,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that."
14384,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,You know who I was before I came here? What I could've been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.
14385,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Who was she?
14386,aemon,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.
14387,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!"
14388,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!"
14389,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"I'm sorry, I can't."
14390,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do."
14391,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Pyp! Open the gate.
14392,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I can't.
14393,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Sam, is that you?!"
14394,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Yes!
14395,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
14396,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!"
14397,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I've never heard you curse before.
14398,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Yes, well, best get used to it."
14399,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella."
14400,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,It was horrible.
14401,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.
14402,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Don't let them send me away, Sam."
14403,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Never.
14404,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I know there's no women allowed.
14405,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too."
14406,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Get ready!
14407,thenn warg,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,It's time.
14408,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Pick up the pace!
14409,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser."
14410,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,A hundred thousand you say?
14411,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Yes sir.
14412,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,You can say it if you like. We should've sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.
14413,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"It was a difficult decision either way, Ser."
14414,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job."
14415,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
14416,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,You're leaving me again?
14417,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I'm not leaving you!
14418,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.
14419,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I...I didn't mean in the same room.
14420,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,What are you going to do out there?
14421,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Help my brothers.
14422,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.
14423,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
14424,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here."
14425,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do."
14426,gilly,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Promise me you won't die.
14427,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I promise you I won't die.
14428,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.
14429,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?
14430,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us."
14431,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?"
14432,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid."
14433,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,But you're afraid now?
14434,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore."
14435,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
14436,styr,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,How high are the walls?
14437,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened."
14438,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Let's kill some Crows!
14439,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,*yells* Come on! *puts out the fire*
14440,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Archers knock, everyone else hold."
14441,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!
14442,night's watch,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,No Ser!
14443,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!
14444,night's watch,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,No Ser!
14445,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,You all plan to die here tonight?
14446,night's watch,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,No Ser!
14447,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,That's very good to hear. Draw!
14449,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,They're attacking the southern gates!
14450,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Now?
14451,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Now!
14452,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"I'm going down then. Brother Slynt, you have The Wall."
14453,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,What?!
14454,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"What are you fucking waiting for, loose!"
14455,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,You heard the man. Loose!
14456,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"You, over there."
14457,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Did you get one?
14458,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"No. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam."
14459,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Yeah?
14460,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I think we're gonna die.
14461,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,If you keep missing we will.
14462,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?
14463,night's watch,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,No!
14464,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you, Castle Black will stand."
14465,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,The Night's Watch will stand.
14466,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"With me now! Now, with me!"
14467,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders."
14468,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,We can't just let them attack the gate!
14469,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"The bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel."
14470,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?"
14471,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.
14472,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, he said he needs ya."
14473,janos slynt,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Needed below? Yes. Yes.
14474,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!
14475,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,They won't summit before dawn.
14476,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,How do you know that?
14477,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Because I've made that claim.
14478,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.
14479,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Knock! Draw! Loose!
14480,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"I got one. Right through the heart, he's dead."
14481,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Oh, is it over?"
14482,pypar,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Huh?
14483,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*
14484,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright."
14485,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Now!
14486,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Now!
14487,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"*to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate."
14488,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Alright.
14489,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,*grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...
14490,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"They won't. Come on Hill! And you Cooper! You three, on me! Come on you lazy bastards!"
14491,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Oil!
14492,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Oil on the ramp!
14493,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Protect the gate!
14494,alliser thorne,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Hold the fucking gate! Hold it!
14495,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,*to Grenn* We need more men down here.
14496,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,We have to hold the gate.
14497,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,But we need men here.
14498,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Tell Jon! He's in command. *to the men behind him* Let's go!
14499,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,*to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!
14500,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?"
14501,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!"
14502,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,What are you doing up here?
14503,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.
14504,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them."
14505,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Two brothers now fight with me.
14506,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Might as well enjoy our last night, right boys? Light the fuckers up. Knock! Draw! Loose!"
14507,donnel hill,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,How are we gonna stop that?
14508,cooper,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,We shot twenty-eight arrows in him already.
14509,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"You heard Jon, we hold the gate."
14510,donnel hill,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.
14511,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,We hold the gate!
14512,donnel hill,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Mother save me. Father save me.
14513,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us, you hear me?"
14514,donnel hill,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"No, please."
14515,grenn,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns"
14517,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,*to Sam* I don't want you out there.
14518,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
14519,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I need him more than I need you.
14520,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,We need you boy.
14521,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Jon Snow.
14522,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"No, shh, don't talk."
14523,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Do you remember that cave?
14524,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,We should've stayed in that cave.
14525,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,We'll go back there.
14526,ygritte,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
14527,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Drop the scythe, boys!"
14528,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Hoister up!
14529,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,They've had enough for one night.
14530,eddard stark,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Don't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us a thousand to one.
14531,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Tormund. It's over, let it end."
14532,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,This is how a man ends.
14533,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Put him in chains. We'll question him later.
14534,tormund,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I should've thrown you from the top of your wall boy!
14535,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Aye, you should've."
14536,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?"
14537,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,We held them off.
14538,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,For one night.
14539,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,This is a great victory.
14540,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them."
14541,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Where are you going?
14542,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I'm going to find Mance.
14543,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.
14544,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home."
14545,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Without Mance? You're going to kill him?
14546,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I'm going to try.
14547,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him."
14548,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
14549,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!
14550,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?
14551,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,"They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out."
14552,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,What are you doing?
14553,jon snow,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
14554,sam,4,39,the watchers on the wall,Unnamed Scene_60,Jon. Come back.
14555,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,You're wearing a black cloak again.
14556,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,I've been sent to negotiate with you.
14557,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was."
14558,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows."
14559,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?"
14560,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
14561,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Did you see her again at Castle Black?
14562,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Yes.
14563,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,And?
14564,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,She's dead.
14565,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Your doing?
14566,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,No.
14567,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,We'll drink to her.
14568,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last."
14569,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Ygritte.
14570,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Ygritte.
14571,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,That's not wine.
14572,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty."
14573,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
14574,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
14575,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Grenn came from a farm.
14576,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Mag and Grenn.
14577,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Grenn and Mag.
14578,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?"
14579,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Turn your army around and go home.
14580,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?
14581,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
14582,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black."
14583,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?"
14584,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,You attacking us?
14585,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"No, it's like you said, we don't have the men."
14586,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Hold! To me. To me.
14587,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.
14588,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,You're the king beyond the wall?
14589,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,You know who I am?
14590,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Never had the pleasure.
14591,davos seaworth,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms."
14592,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.
14593,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
14594,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,We do not kneel.
14595,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king."
14596,mance rayder,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"All the same, we do not kneel."
14597,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Take these men away.
14598,davos seaworth,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?
14599,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
14600,davos seaworth,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.
14601,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son."
14602,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Your father was an honorable man.
14603,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"He was, your grace."
14604,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,What do you think he'd have done with him?
14605,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"I was this man's prisoner once. He could've tortured me, he could've killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father would've taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
14606,stannis baratheon,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,Very well. *to Davos* Take him.
14607,jon snow,4,40,the children,Unnamed Scene_61,"Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them."
14608,pycelle,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.
14609,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Bloody Martells.
14610,pycelle,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,The cause appears to be manticore venom.
14611,qyburn,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"It is, yes, manticore."
14612,pycelle,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done."
14613,qyburn,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Yes there is.
14614,pycelle,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,May I ask what you think you're doing?
14615,qyburn,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Saving him.
14616,pycelle,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester."
14617,qyburn,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.
14618,pycelle,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion."
14619,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"You're dismissed, Grand Maester."
14620,pycelle,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Your grace. This is my laboratory!
14621,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Not anymore.
14622,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,You can save him?
14623,qyburn,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance."
14624,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.
14625,qyburn,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"Thank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat."
14626,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Will it weaken him?
14627,qyburn,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Oh no.
14628,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Very well then.
14629,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed."
14630,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,I'm opening it again.
14631,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
14632,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,I will not.
14633,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was."
14634,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king."
14635,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-"
14636,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.
14637,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?
14638,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away."
14639,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,No.
14640,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen."
14641,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,And how will you do that?
14642,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,I'll tell everyone the truth.
14643,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,And what truth would that be?
14644,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you would've known."
14645,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Known what?
14646,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.
14647,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"No, no, no, no, no."
14648,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Your legacy is a lie.
14649,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,I don't believe you.
14650,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Yes you do.
14651,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Jaime.
14652,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?"
14653,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine."
14654,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Tyrion is your family.
14655,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,He's not.
14656,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,You don't get to choose.
14657,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-"
14658,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
14659,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?"
14660,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-"
14661,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,I choose you.
14662,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Those are words.
14663,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.
14664,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Told him what?
14665,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,I told him about us.
14666,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,You told him?
14667,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you."
14668,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,You think he'll just accept that?
14669,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Go and ask him.
14670,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,What did you say?
14671,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,"I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters."
14672,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,Someone will walk in.
14673,cersei lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_27,I don't care.
14674,missandei,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,"*in Valyrian* You stand before Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Mereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men. Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons."
14675,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,"*in Valyrian* Thank you for seeing me, your grace. My name is Fennesz. I can speak the common tongue if you wish."
14676,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,You speak it very well.
14677,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,"Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much."
14678,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?
14679,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,"When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets."
14680,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
14681,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,"I do not mean to offend, your grace. I went to one of these places. The young prey on the old. Take what they want and beat us if we resist."
14682,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,"My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you."
14683,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,"Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children."
14684,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,What is it that you want from me?
14685,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,"Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal."
14686,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,"You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?"
14687,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,"Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-"
14688,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
14689,fennesz,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,"Thank you, your grace. Thank you."
14690,barristan selmy,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.
14691,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,Approach my friend.
14693,missandei,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,*in Low Valyrian* The Queen says you may approach.
14695,missandei,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,*translating* I have brought you. He came from the sky. The black one. The winged shadow. He came from the sky and...
14696,missandei,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,*translating* My girl. My little girl.
14697,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,What was her name?
14698,missandei,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,"Zala, your grace."
14699,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,How old was she?
14700,missandei,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,Three.
14701,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon?
14702,grey worm,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,"*in Valyrian* Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago, my queen. Nothing since then."
14703,daenerys targaryen,4,40,the children,MEREEN_1,*in Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs.
14704,aemon,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,"They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west. They died protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names. It is for us to remember them. Our brothers, we shall never see their like again."
14706,aemon,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,And now their watch is ended.
14707,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,Your old blind man patched me up. Why?
14708,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,"He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe."
14709,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,You want me alive so you can torture me?
14710,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,No one's going to torture you.
14711,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?
14712,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,I don't know what happens to the prisoners.
14713,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,Who decides?
14714,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,I suppose Stannis does.
14715,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,He your king now?
14716,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,I don't have a king.

14718,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?
14719,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,Words? What kind of words?
14720,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.
14721,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,Do what?
14722,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,Say farewell.
14723,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,"The dead can't hear us, boy."
14724,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,Snow. Did you love her? She loved you.
14725,jon snow,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,She told you?
14726,tormund,4,40,the children,CASTLE BLACK_7,No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That's how I know. She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me?

14756,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,What sort of hobble?
14757,podrick payne,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"A figure-eight, like you taught me."
14758,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,If you did it like I taught you then the horses would be here.

14774,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Good name.
14775,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Who taught you how to fight?
14776,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,My father.
14777,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Mine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys.
14778,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"Mine said the same. But I kept fighting the boys anyway. Kept losing. Finally my father said, “If you’re going to do it, you might as well do it right.”"
14779,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"Seven blessings. I’m Brienne of Tarth, this is Podrick Payne."

14781,podrick payne,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,That’s Sandor Clegane- the Hound.
14782,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You’re Arya Stark.
14783,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I asked if you wanted something.
14784,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.
14785,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,My mother’s dead.
14786,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I know. I wish I could’ve been there to protect her.
14787,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You’re not a northerner.
14788,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"I know, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her."
14789,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Why didn’t you?
14790,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King’s Landing.
14791,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You’re paid by the Lannisters. You’re here for the bounty on me.
14792,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I’m not paid by the Lannisters.
14793,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"No? Fancy sword you’ve got there. Where’d you get it? I’ve been looking at Lannister gold all my life. Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth, tell me that’s not Lannister gold."
14794,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.
14795,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,The Bloody Gate’s ten miles.

14798,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Arya!
14799,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You heard the girl! She’s not coming with you.
14800,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,She is.
14801,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You’re not a good listener. Valyrian steel-- I’ve always wanted some Valyrian steel.
14802,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Come with me Arya. I’ll take you to safety.
14803,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"Safety?! Where the fuck’s that? Her aunt in the Eyrie’s dead. Her mother’s dead, her father’s dead, her brother’s dead. Winterfell’s a pile of rubble. There’s no safety, you dumb bitch. If you don’t know that by now, you’re the wrong one to watch over her."
14804,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,And that’s what you’re doing? Watching over her?
14805,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"Aye, that’s what I’m doing."
14806,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I have no wish to kill you Ser.
14807,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I’m not a knight.
14808,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Arya! Arya! ARYA! Where is she?
14809,podrick payne,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,She was just here...
14810,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Why weren’t you watching her?
14811,podrick payne,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I was watching you I thought you migth need some help…
14812,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Which way Pod? Which way did she go?
14813,podrick payne,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"Ah, I think that way."
14814,brienne of tarth,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Arya!
14815,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You’re still here? [Coughs] Big bitch saved you.
14816,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I don’t need saving.
14817,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"No, not you. You’re a real killer. With your water dancing, and your needle."
14818,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,You’re gonna die?
14819,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"Unless there’s a Maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I’m done. I’d skin you alive for wine. [Arya offers water.] Fuck water! Killed by a woman. (Chuckles) I bet you liked that. Go on, go after her. She’ll help you. Going out alone, you won’t last a day out there."
14820,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,I’ll last longer than you.
14821,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,"You remember where the heart is? Fuck it. I’m ready. Go on, girl. Another name off your list. You kept promising me. I cut down your butcher’s boy, the ginger. He was begging for mercy. Please sir, please don’t kill me, please, please. Bled all over my horse. Saddle stunk of butcher’s boy for weeks. And your sister, your pretty sister. I should’ve taken her. That night the Blackwater burned, I should’ve fucked her bloody. At least I’d have one happy memory! Do I have to beg you? Do it. Do it."
14822,sandor clegane,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_7,Kill me. Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!
14823,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,"Oh, get on with it you son of a whore."
14824,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,Is that any way to speak about our mother?
14825,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,What’re you doing?
14826,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,What do you think I’m doing? The galley’s waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.
14827,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,Who’s helping you?
14828,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,Varys.
14829,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,Varys?
14830,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,You have more friends than you thought.
14831,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,"There’s a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open."
14832,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,"I suppose this is goodbye, then."
14833,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,"Farewell, little brother."
14834,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,"Jaime, thank you. For my life."
14835,jaime lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,Quickly now.
14837,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
14838,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,"Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we’ll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure…"
14839,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,"All my life, you’ve wanted me dead."
14840,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,"Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what’s yours. I’d never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I’d never let Illyn Payne take your head. You’re a Lannister. You’re my son."
14841,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,I loved her.
14842,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,Who?
14843,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,Shae.
14844,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,"Bah, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow."
14845,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,I murdered her. With my own hands.
14846,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,It doesn’t matter.
14847,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,It doesn’t matter?
14848,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,She was a whore!
14849,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,Say that word again.
14850,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,And what? You’ll kill your own father in the privy? No. You’re my son. Enough of this nonsense…
14851,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,"I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn’t poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?"
14852,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,Enough. We’ll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.
14853,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,I can’t go back there. She’s in there.
14854,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,"What, are you afraid of a dead whore?"
14855,tywin lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,You shot me. You’re no son of mine.
14856,tyrion lannister,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,I am your son. I have always been your son.
14857,varys,4,40,the children,KING'S LANDING_29,"What have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend, I’ve brought you this far."
14858,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9,I want to see the captain.
14860,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9,"I want to go north, to the wall."
14862,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9,I can pay.
14864,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9,"I wouldn’t need a cabin. Please, I could work, scrubbing the floors, or…"
14866,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9,Where’s home?
14868,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9,"Wait, I have something else."
14870,arya stark,4,40,the children,THE RIVERLANDS_9,"It’s not silver, it’s iron."

14876,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,He’ll never know we’ve been gone.
14878,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,You don’t need to be afraid of my father.
14880,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,Yes.
14882,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,Of course we should.
14883,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,Get out. Get out!
14885,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,No.
14886,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,Listen to your friend.
14887,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,They said that you were terrifying. With cat’s teeth and three eyes. You’re not terrifying. You’re boring.
14888,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,You don’t know what I am.
14889,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,I know you’re a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.
14890,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,Everybody wants to know their future. Until they know their future.
14891,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,This is my father’s land. My land. Tell me my future or I’ll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.
14892,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,Your blood. Give me a taste.
14893,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,Three questions you get. You won’t like the answers.
14894,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,I’ve been promised to the prince. When will we marry?
14895,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,You’ll never wed the prince. You’ll wed the king.
14896,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,But I will be queen?
14897,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,"Oh yes, you’ll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear."
14898,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,Will the king and I have children?
14899,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,"No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3."
14900,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,That doesn’t make sense.
14901,maggy,5,41,the wars to come,Unnamed Scene_62,Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.
14904,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.
14907,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,They will wait.
14908,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,"He never wanted you to be a King’s Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body."

14910,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,They?
14911,jaime lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,All of them out there are enemies. They’re waiting a night to make sure he’s really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they’ll set to work on tearing us apart.
14912,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,"They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he’s the enemy. I’ve been telling you for years, you’ve been defending him for years…"
14913,jaime lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,This is exactly what they want.
14914,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,...and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?
14915,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,"Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You’re a man of action, aren’t you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. (gestures towards Tywin) Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world."
14916,varys,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,Apologies.
14917,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,I still don’t see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
14918,varys,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,"I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”."
14919,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,Do you know what it’s like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
14920,varys,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,No. I only know what it’s like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
14921,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,Pentos?
14922,varys,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,"The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself."
14923,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,Much better.
14924,varys,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,My lord?
14925,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,I don’t think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don’t suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
14926,varys,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
14927,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,In a box. Why stop now?
14928,varys,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,Because we are talking about the future of our country.
14929,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY_1,The future is shit. Just like the past.
14931,white rat,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,You… you don’t have to.
14933,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,Sons of the Harpy?
14934,barristan selmy,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,"Yes, your grace. They left it on the body."
14935,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,They’ve never killed before.
14936,barristan selmy,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,"It was only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors are always met with resistance."
14937,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,I didn’t conquer them. Their own people did.
14938,mossador,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,"They do not see us as people, Your Grace."
14939,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,"Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?"
14940,grey worm,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,"White Rat, your grace."
14941,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.
14942,barristan selmy,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.
14943,mossador,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,Make them very angry.
14944,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.
14945,missandei,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,Torgo Nudho.
14946,grey worm,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,Missandei hin Naath.
14947,missandei,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,I wanted to speak with you.
14948,grey worm,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,Why do you come?
14949,missandei,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,"White Rat, the Unsullied who… I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen’s brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?"
14950,grey worm,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_5,I do not know. I must go.
14951,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,Get your shield up.
14952,olly,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,It’s too heavy.
14953,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,"If it wasn’t heavy it wouldn’t stop a sword, now get it up."
14954,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I’ll ring your head like a bell.
14955,gilly,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,"Shouldn’t you be training, too?"
14956,sam,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,"Well, I’m hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they’ve killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!"
14957,alliser thorne,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,These men need a firm hand. Always have. They’re poachers and thieves.
14958,alliser thorne,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,Not soldiers.
14959,gilly,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,That one hates me.
14960,sam,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander… he hates the wildlings.
14961,sam,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,All the wildlings.
14962,gilly,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,Don’t let them send us away.
14963,sam,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,"It’s not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he’s a good man. He’s running against Ser Alliser--"
14964,gilly,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,Sam! Don’t let them send us away.
14965,sam,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,"I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too."
14966,gilly,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,"You can’t leave, they’ll execute you."
14967,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,"Good, good, pivot! Don’t forget to pivot! Shield up!"
14968,melisandre,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,The king wants a word.
14969,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,"You’re not cold, my lady?"
14970,melisandre,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,"Never. The Lord’s fire lives within me, Jon Snow."
14971,melisandre,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,Feel.
14972,melisandre,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,Are you a virgin?
14973,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,No.
14974,melisandre,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,Good.
14975,melisandre,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell.
14976,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,You know who rules at Winterfell now?
14977,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,Roose Bolton.
14978,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark’s heart. Don’t you want to avenge him?
14979,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,"I want a great many things, your grace. But I’m a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch now."
14980,davos seaworth,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,I’ve been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.
14981,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,They’re good men.
14982,davos seaworth,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,Many don’t. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?
14983,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,It’s where she belonged.
14984,davos seaworth,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,Some of the Night’s Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.
14985,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn’t make them monsters.
14986,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can’t protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton’s head on a spike. But if I’m to take Winterfell I’ll need more men.
14987,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,The men of the Night’s Watch are sworn to play no part--
14988,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,I’m not talking about the damn Night’s Watch. I’m talking about the wildlings.
14989,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,"Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?"
14990,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,"If they swear to follow me, I’ll pardon them. We’ll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I’ll declare them citizens of the realm. I’ll give them land to live on."
14991,davos seaworth,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,It’s a fair offer. More than fair.
14992,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,I’ll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
14993,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,I don’t think that’s likely.
14994,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,"You admire him, don’t you?"
14995,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,I respect him.
14996,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...
14997,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,Your grace…
14998,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,...or he burns.
14999,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,How much time do I have?
15000,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_9,"Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow."
15001,master of arms,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,"Sword up! Attack, my lord! Attack! Don’t cross your feet!"
15002,yohn royce,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,My sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk. This one…
15003,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.
15004,yohn royce,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,Great warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy.
15005,squire,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,My lord. (hands Baelish a note)
15006,master of arms,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,"Sword up, my lord!"
15007,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,Some boys develop more slowly. He’s still young.
15008,yohn royce,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,He’s 13. Boys go to war at 13.
15009,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,He has other gifts.
15010,yohn royce,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,Does he?
15011,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,The gift of a great name. Sometimes that’s all one needs.
15012,sansa stark,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,"Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you’ve done for me."
15013,yohn royce,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,"I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady."
15014,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,"I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin’s skills will have improved immeasurably."
15015,yohn royce,5,41,the wars to come,THE VALE OF ARRYN_1,"He’ll be safe here. As for his skills, I make no promises."
15016,podrick payne,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We’re a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--"
15017,brienne of tarth,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Us? The only reason you’re here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren’t safe in the capital. You’re hundreds of miles from King’s Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You’re safe.
15018,podrick payne,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,But I’m you’re squire.
15019,brienne of tarth,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Do you even know what a squire is?
15020,podrick payne,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,An attendant to a knight?
15021,brienne of tarth,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,I’m not a knight. That means you’re not a squire.
15022,podrick payne,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"Well, where would I go?"
15023,brienne of tarth,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"I don’t care, I’m not your mother."
15024,podrick payne,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,You swore to find the Stark girls.
15025,brienne of tarth,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,I found Arya. She didn’t want my protection.
15026,podrick payne,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Sansa still might.
15027,brienne of tarth,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,Will you shut your mouth? I didn’t ask for advice. I don’t want anyone following me. I’m not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
15028,sansa stark,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
15029,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,I did.
15030,sansa stark,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,But we’re heading west.
15031,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,We are.
15032,sansa stark,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"If he wanted to betray us, he already would have."
15033,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he’s not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?"
15034,sansa stark,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
15035,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"No. But I pay them well, and they’ve seen what happens to men who disappoint me."
15036,sansa stark,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?
15037,petyr baelish,5,41,the wars to come,COUNTRYSIDE_1,"So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can’t get her hands on you."
15038,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,"It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn’t presume to claim to have known him as such…"
15039,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a… what a force to be reckoned with.
15040,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,Thank you so much for your kind words.
15042,lancel lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,Your grace.
15043,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
15044,lancel lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,My deepest sympathies.
15045,kevan lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,I apologize for my son’s appearance.
15046,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,"Uncle, it’s quite alright."
15047,kevan lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,"They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point… They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive."
15048,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,I’m sure he’ll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.
15049,kevan lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,Of course.
15050,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
15051,lancel lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,It wasn’t my wounds that needed healing.
15052,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,What can I do for you?
15053,lancel lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,You can forgive me.
15054,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
15055,lancel lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,I led you into the darkness.
15056,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,I doubt you’ve ever led anyone anywhere.
15057,lancel lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,"I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine."
15058,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,I don’t know what you’re talking about.
15059,lancel lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,"I’m a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy… or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father’s soul."
15060,cersei lannister,5,41,the wars to come,KING’S LANDING_11,The day Tywin Lannister’s soul needs your help…
15061,olyvar,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,It looks like Dorne.
15062,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,No it doesn’t.
15063,olyvar,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,It does. That’s the Sunspear bit right there. And that’s where the mountains are. And over here is… Sunsnake? Stonespear?
15064,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,Sandstone.
15065,olyvar,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,"Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there."
15066,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,Fine.
15067,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,It’s Dorne.
15068,olyvar,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.
15069,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,"Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here."
15070,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,We’re late for dinner as it is.
15071,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,You’re very respectful.
15072,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,I’m very hungry.
15073,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,What’s your name?
15074,olyvar,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,"Olyvar, my lady."
15075,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,"I’m afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar."
15076,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
15077,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What’s the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
15078,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,In any event… (throws Loras his clothes) you shouldn’t keep your intended waiting.
15079,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,My intended? Please. Tywin’s dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.
15080,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,Lucky you.
15081,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,Unlucky you.
15082,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,You think I want that woman married to my brother?
15083,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,"If she doesn’t marry me, she doesn’t go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King’s Landing. Which means you’re trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law."
15084,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,Perhaps.
15085,loras tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,Perhaps?
15086,margaery tyrell,5,41,the wars to come,LORAS’ BEDROOM_1,Perhaps?
15087,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,"Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers."
15088,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,"Imp, half-man."
15089,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,There are faster ways to kill yourself.
15090,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,Not for a coward.
15091,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,"You are many things, my friend, but not a coward."
15092,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,You never told me why you set me free.
15093,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,Your brother asked me to.
15094,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,You could have said no.
15095,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
15096,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,"Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You’re not family, you owe me nothing."
15097,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,I didn’t do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
15098,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
15099,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,I don’t believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
15100,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,You’re going to have to find another soldier. I’m done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
15101,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,"You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
15102,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,I’m not well-suited for work.
15103,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,"I think you are. You have your father’s instinct for politics, and you have compassion."
15104,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
15105,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,I never said you were perfect.
15106,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,What is it you want exactly?
15107,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
15108,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,"Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that’s how they became powerful in the first place."
15109,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,"Perhaps. And perhaps we’ve grown so used to horror we assume there’s no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?"
15110,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
15111,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,"No, you won’t. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name."
15112,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,Good luck finding him.
15113,varys,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,"Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio’s palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for."
15114,tyrion lannister,5,41,the wars to come,PENTOS_1,Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
15115,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven’t been behaving themselves.
15116,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,"The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review."
15117,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,Good.
15118,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,They did ask for some concessions.
15119,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,Concessions?
15120,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,"Politics is the art of compromise, your grace."
15121,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,I’m not a politician. I’m a queen.
15122,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,"Forgive me. You’re right, of course. Still, it’s easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones."
15123,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,"I don’t expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery."
15124,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.
15125,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
15126,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,"In the new world that you’ve brought to us, free men would fight free men."
15127,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.
15128,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,No fighting pits.
15129,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
15130,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.
15131,hizdahr zo loraq,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,If you--
15132,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,How many times must I say no before you understand?
15133,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,Whatever he wants from me he’s not going to get it. If he really believes I’m going to reopen the fighting pits…
15134,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,You should reopen the fighting pits.
15135,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,What?
15136,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,"My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before."
15137,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,Why?
15138,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,"I was a bad child. I wasn’t big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16."
15139,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,"You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you’re defending the fighting pits?"
15140,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,"I’m only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you."
15141,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,"You’re the queen. Everyone’s too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You’ve made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they’ll attack. Show your strength here, now."
15142,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,That’s why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
15143,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You’re not the Mother of Unsullied. You’re the Mother of Dragons.
15144,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,I don’t want another child’s bones dropped at my feet. No one’s seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he’s flown halfway across the world. I can’t control them anymore.
15145,daario naharis,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.
15146,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,Viserion? Rhaegal?
15147,daenerys targaryen,5,41,the wars to come,MEEREEN_7,Easy. Easy. Easy.
15148,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,So here we are.
15149,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,Here we are.
15150,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,"When we first met you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting…"
15151,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,This doesn’t have to be our last meeting.
15152,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,"No, but it will be."
15153,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,You know what Stannis wants?
15154,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I’ll give him this much
15155,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,Shouldn’t a king be bold?
15156,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,"Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he’ll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I’ll never serve him."
15157,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,You told me you weren’t here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.
15158,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,That’s right. But I don’t want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.
15159,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,"You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life’s work uniting them. You didn’t do it for power. You didn’t do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they’re north of the wall. Isn’t their survival more important than your pride?"
15160,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn’t about that.
15161,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,Then bend the knee and save your people.
15162,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that’s all gone.
15163,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won’t go out and rescue them because why? You’re afraid of looking afraid.
15164,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,"Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?"
15165,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,They’ll burn you alive.
15166,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,"Bad way to go. I’ll be honest with you, I don’t want to die. And burnt to death, I don’t want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it’s better than betraying everything I believe."
15167,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,"And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they’ll sing songs about you. “You’d rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there’s no one left to sing."
15168,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,"You’re a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can’t understand why I won’t enlist my people in a foreigner’s war, there’s no point explaining."
15169,jon snow,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,I think you’re making a terrible mistake.
15170,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.
15171,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,"Mance Rayder, you’ve been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy."
15172,stannis baratheon,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,Kneel and live.
15173,mance rayder,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
15174,melisandre,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,"Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false."
15175,melisandre,5,41,the wars to come,CASTLE BLACK_11,"Free folk, there is only one true king, and his name is Stannis. Here stands the king of lies. Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness."

15196,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You are becoming an observant young lady.
15197,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"My mother used to say, ""dark wings, dark words""."
15198,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.
15199,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,So it was good news.?
15200,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,My marriage proposal has been accepted.
15201,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.
15203,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I'll have some.
15204,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,My lady!
15205,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,What is it?
15206,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Sansa Stark. (Brienne begins to turn around) Don't look!
15207,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You sure?
15208,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"She's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish."
15209,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Littlefinger?
15210,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,A bunch of knights with him.
15211,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"10, I think. Too many. My lady, I don't think this is the right--"
15212,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Ready the horses.
15213,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,We only have one horse.
15214,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Find more.
15215,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Do you like the taste?
15216,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?
15217,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,It gives some men courage.
15218,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Does it give you courage?
15220,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth."
15221,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then."
15222,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new."
15223,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. (Brienne gets up) You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?"
15224,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I was.
15225,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.
15226,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,It was after Renly's murder.
15227,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him."
15228,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I tried to save him.
15229,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,But you were accused.
15230,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,By men who didn't see what happened.
15231,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Then what did happen?
15232,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.
15233,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,A shadow? With a face? (scoffs) This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?
15234,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Why should you have any say in her affairs?
15235,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved’s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."
15236,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--"
15237,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,No.
15238,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Please, my lady. If I could explain--"
15239,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.
15240,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.
15241,sansa stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,And sometimes we do. You should leave.
15242,petyr baelish,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?
15245,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Podrick! (Podrick screams as he loses control of the horse)
15246,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Stop, stop, stop! (Horse stops) That’s a good boy."
15247,knight,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I guess that means you’re unarmed.

15249,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Podrick?
15250,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Yes, my lady?"
15251,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You can stand now.
15252,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Yes, my lady. (stands) Sansa Stark?"
15253,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We’ll follow them."
15254,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you’re released from your vow."
15255,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I swore to their mother I’d protect those girls.
15256,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,If they don’t want your protection--
15257,brienne of tarth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Do you think she’s safe from Littlefinger?
15258,podrick payne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"(pause) No, my lady."

15268,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Not so loud.
15269,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Our daughter’s in danger, and you’re worried I’m speaking too loudly!"
15270,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,The world can't know knows she’s our daughter.
15271,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Then don’t call her your daughter. You’ve never been a father to her.
15272,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"If I was the father to any of my children, they’d be stoned in the streets."
15273,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.
15274,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I’ll make things better.
15275,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You never made anything better.
15276,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I’m going to Dorne. I’ll bring our daughter home.
15277,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You can’t just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She’s promised his son.
15278,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I’m not going to ask him anything.
15279,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"You go there with an army, it’s an act of war."
15280,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,No army. Do you know where they’re keeping her?
15281,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
15282,jaime lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"I’ll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?"

I adore music. But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?"

15328,doran martell,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.

15330,doran martell,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I will bury him. I will mourn for him.

15332,doran martell,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You would have me go to war?

15337,doran martell,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.

15345,daario naharis,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide."

15350,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Why?
15351,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"For one thing, he may have valuable information."
15352,daario naharis,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
15353,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,How do you know that?
15354,daario naharis,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Because I questioned him.

15358,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
15359,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.
15360,hizdahr zo loraq,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,And how do you know this?
15361,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Everyone knows this.
15362,hizdahr zo loraq,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family."

15368,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,About your father. About the Mad King.
15369,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
15370,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first.  Your enemies did not lie."
15371,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Go on.
15372,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two."
15373,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I'm not my father.
15374,barristan selmy,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end."

15409,qyburn,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work."
15410,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Very good.
15411,qyburn,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Over there will be fine.
15412,meryn trant,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You heard the man. Over there.
15413,kevan lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You're the Hand of the King?
15414,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."
15415,mace tyrell,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--"
15416,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin."
15417,mace tyrell,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Oh, Your Grace."
15418,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
15419,mace tyrell,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"The honor is all mine, Your Grace."
15420,pycelle,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand."
15421,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
15422,pycelle,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?"
15423,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have."
15424,pycelle,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I must say I cannot see--
15425,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title."
15426,kevan lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.
15427,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,The king is very busy at this moment.
15428,kevan lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"He should be here, learning what it means to rule."
15429,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf."
15430,kevan lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. (looks to Qyburn) Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
15431,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
15432,kevan lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,What mission?
15433,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,That is not your concern as Master of War.
15434,kevan lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.
15435,cersei lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You would abandon your king in his time of need?
15436,kevan lannister,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock."
15437,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Come on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.
15438,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!
15439,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Right, very good!"
15440,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?"
15441,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"I know ""S""."
15442,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things."
15443,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Well, you're a wonderful teacher. (to Sam) Very patient!"
15444,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read."
15445,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.
15446,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,How old were you when you learned to read?
15447,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Three.
15448,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Three?! Who taught you, your mother?"
15449,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because... (trails off)
15450,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?"
15451,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?
15452,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?
15453,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?"
15454,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.
15455,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Did you ever see them?
15456,gilly,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope."
15457,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,What did he do to them in the woods?
15458,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Mother.
15459,selyse baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Leave us.
15460,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Your Grace.
15461,selyse baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You need to stay away from that girl.
15462,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Why?
15463,selyse baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,She's a wildling.
15464,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.
15465,selyse baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.
15466,shireen baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Gilly wouldn't do that.
15467,selyse baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.
15468,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you."
15469,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive."
15470,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Who then? You?
15471,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,No. Only one of their own.
15472,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?
15473,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,The Lord Commander's niece.
15474,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response."
15475,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"""Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."" (Jon smiles)"
15476,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,That amuses you?
15477,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own."
15478,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.
15479,davos seaworth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win."
15480,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Most likely.
15481,davos seaworth,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?
15482,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Unpleasant, I expect."
15483,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.
15484,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you."
15485,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You can give me the North.
15486,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow."
15487,stannis baratheon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell."
15488,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
15489,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again."
15490,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.
15491,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,I'm going to refuse him.
15492,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
15493,jon snow,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?"
15494,alliser thorne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.
15495,aemon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?
15496,janos slynt,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings."
15498,janos slynt,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. He's the only true choice.
15499,aemon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Is there anyone else?
15500,shadow tower brother,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better."
15501,aemon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"If there's no one else, we will begin the voting. The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne. The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. Each brother will--"
15502,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Maester Aemon.
15503,aemon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Samwell Tarly. Go on.
15504,janos slynt,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Sam the Slayer.
15505,janos slynt,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer?
15506,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.
15507,janos slynt,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Lies!
15508,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making."
15509,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading."
15510,sam,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. (a man next to Sam nods) He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest."
15511,alliser thorne,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"I can't argue with any of that. (stands up) But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?"
15512,aemon,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,It is time.
15518,arya stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Turn around and go. (pulls out Needle) Turn around and go.
15520,arya stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Nothing's worth anything to dead men.
15522,arya stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Who are you? Why were they scared of you?
15524,arya stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
15525,jaqen h'ghar,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.
15526,arya stark,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Well who are you then?
15527,jaqen h'ghar,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,No one. And that is who a girl must become.
15528,harpy,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"She doesn't belong here. And no matter how many of your traitors call her ""Mhysa"", she will never be your mother."
15529,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Why?
15530,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"For you, Mhysa. (kneels) You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied. I set you free, as you did all of us."
15531,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right."
15532,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt.
15533,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.
15534,mossador,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? (beat) When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting. If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived."
15535,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,"The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--"
15536,mosador,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,--and now you are the law!
15537,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,The law is the law. Take him.
15539,hizdahr zo loraq,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,She should have cut off the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.
15540,daario naharis,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,Which is what I keep telling her to do to you.
15541,daenerys targaryen,5,42,the house of black and white,another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's_1,You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other.

15555,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_64,Good.
15556,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_64,I didn't come here to sweep floors.
15557,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_64,"No? Why come, then?"
15558,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_64,You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.
15559,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_64,"A man teaches a girl. (Stands up). Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. (Walks away)."
15560,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_64,I want to serve. (Jaqen stops).
15561,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_64,"A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one."
15562,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_64,Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.
15563,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_64,There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.
15564,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,Unnamed Scene_64,Where are they taking him?
15567,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,Did I hurt you?
15568,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,No. You were lovely.
15569,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,It all happened so fast.
15570,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,Yes. (Chuckles).
15571,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded"
15572,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived."
15573,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life."
15574,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"Wouldn't that be glorious? (They laugh. Tommen leans in to kiss her). Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?"
15575,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
15576,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name."
15577,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
15578,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,So strange… Husband.
15579,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"Wife. (They laugh). Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, (She chuckles), and it's all because my brother died."
15580,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty."
15581,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.
15582,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,Do you like to sail?
15583,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,(Sits up). I love to sail.
15584,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"I do, too."
15585,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"I think we're going to be very happy, you and I."
15586,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"I do, too."
15587,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?"
15588,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
15589,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. (Pours them some wine).
15590,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"Well, but I'm a man now."
15591,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,You are. And the king. (Hands him win). But you'll always be her baby-boy.
15592,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,I suppose.
15593,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. (Sits down and begins to comb her hair). Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight."
15594,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters."
15595,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
15596,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
15597,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,That's where you grew up. (They stop). You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
15598,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,(Chuckles). Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
15599,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home."
15600,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,This is my real home now. Where my family lives.
15601,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"I want you to be happy, mother."
15602,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy."
15603,tommen baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?
15604,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"" (Laugher). And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."""
15605,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,Mother! (Gets up and hugs Cersei). Welcome.
15606,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.
15607,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.
15608,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you."
15609,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,You are very sweet.
15610,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
15611,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.
15612,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
15613,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. (Margaery’s friends laugh)."
15614,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,I'll leave you to it then. (Turns to leave).
15615,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?"
15616,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,There's no need for such formalities.
15617,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,"In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon."
15618,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,Won’t that be a lovely day.
15619,margaery tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.
15620,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_13,Remember. Anything you need.
15621,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19,We can't hold the North with terror alone.
15622,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19,You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.
15623,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19,"I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies."
15624,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19,"Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot."
15625,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19,He left you no choice.
15626,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19,"I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch."
15627,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19,And?
15628,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19,The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
15629,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19,(After a moment). I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.
15630,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19,We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?
15631,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19,Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
15632,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_19,"I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. (Stands up). Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North."
15633,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,That's Moat Cailin.
15634,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before."
15635,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?"
15636,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,Home.
15637,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"The Boltons have Winterfell. (He nods). The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?"
15638,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,(Shakes his head). No.
15639,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!
15640,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,He did.
15641,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,He serves the Lannisters.
15642,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,For now.
15643,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,I won't go.
15644,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,Winterfell is your home.
15645,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,Not anymore.
15646,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.
15647,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.
15648,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -"
15649,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,No!
15650,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,Sansa -
15651,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there."
15652,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"(Grabbing her). I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. (Quietly). You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them."
15653,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,How do we get through there?
15654,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,We don't. We go around. (She turns her horse and begins leaving).
15655,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.
15656,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.
15657,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
15658,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,He hates that nickname.
15659,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?"
15660,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham."
15661,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,He borrowed it?
15662,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son."
15663,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,As punishment. For both of you.
15664,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
15665,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"(Walks away to get firewood). Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person."
15666,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
15667,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
15668,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
15669,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"You want to be a knight, Pod?"
15670,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,Yes.
15671,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. (Sits down). And I'm going to show you how to ride properly."
15672,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,Thank you.
15673,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight."
15674,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,I suppose that's more important.
15675,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?"
15676,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,I was.
15677,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
15678,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,He was.
15679,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,But how did you end up serving Renly?
15680,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"(After a few moments). When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. (Pauses). And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. (Smiles). My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. (Her smile drops). Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty’, they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They’re nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all."
15681,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
15682,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly."
15683,podrick payne,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
15684,brienne of tarth,5,43,high sparrow,MOAT CAILIN_5,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed."
15685,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,Lord Commander.
15686,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,(Stands up). Your Grace.
15687,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,(To Olly as he closes the door). I'd like to speak alone.
15688,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,"Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command."
15689,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,Very well. (They all sit down). Have you considered my offer?
15690,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
15691,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,Say the word and you will be.
15692,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
15693,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
15694,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,"I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
15695,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
15696,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,I can imagine no higher praise.
15697,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,"I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. (Stands up). But if your mind’s made up, I won't try to persuade you."
15698,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,"May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?"
15699,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,Are you bored of us already?
15700,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
15701,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
15702,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,And the wildlings?
15703,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,"They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. (After a moment). Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead."
15704,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,"Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. (Olly stares at him)."
15705,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.
15706,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of  Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
15707,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
15708,stannis baratheon,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.
15709,davos seaworth,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,"He sees something in you. (Jon looks up). Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you."
15710,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,I'm sorry I disappointed him.
15711,davos seaworth,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
15712,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,As long as he's ruling them.
15713,davos seaworth,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
15714,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,I’ve sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
15715,davos seaworth,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,Have you now? (Turning to Olly). How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.
15716,olly,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,Night gathers and now my watch begins -
15717,davos seaworth,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,"Not that bit, the bit at the end."
15718,olly,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,"I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -"
15719,davos seaworth,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,"Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing."
15720,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,And what needs to be done?
15721,davos seaworth,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_13,"As long as the Boltons rule the North, (Stands up), the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion."
15722,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,What do you want?
15723,waif,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,Who are you?
15724,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,What?
15725,waif,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,"You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. (Stops and walks to Arya). Who are you?"
15726,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,"(After a moment, perks up). No one."
15727,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,Ow! Cunt!
15728,waif,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,"A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?"
15729,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,"I told you, I'm no - (Gets hit again). Do that again and -"
15730,waif,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,Who are you?
15731,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,You're about to find out.
15732,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,What are you doing?
15733,waif,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,We were only playing. The game of faces.
15734,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,A girl is not ready.
15735,waif,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,Clearly not.
15736,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,(Stands up). I am ready.
15737,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.
15738,jaqen h'ghar,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,"Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?"
15739,arya stark,5,43,high sparrow,BRAAVOS_1,What do we do with them after we wash them?
15741,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_21,"Lady Sansa, welcome."
15742,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_21,(Smiles). Lord Bolton.
15743,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_21,"May I introduce my son, (Stands aside), Ramsay Bolton?"
15744,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_21,"It's an honor to meet you, my Lady."
15746,sansa stark,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_21,Thank you.
15748,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,Sam. (Sam looks up. Jon looks at Maester Aemon’s chair). Maester Aemon?
15749,sam,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.
15750,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,"Take good care of him. (To the group). Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. (Laughter. Jon looks at Alliser). First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. (Laughter. After a moment, he continues). Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger."
15751,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,"Ser Alliser. (Silence). You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger."
15752,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
15753,janos slynt,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,(Scoffs). Greyguard is a ruin.
15754,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,"Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -"
15755,janos slynt,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.
15756,sam,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,"Alright, alright! Enough of that."
15757,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,"You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard."
15758,janos slynt,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,"(Stands up, angrily shouts). I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!"
15759,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,Are you refusing to obey my order?
15760,janos slynt,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,You can stick your order up your bastard arse.
15761,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,Take Lord Janos outside.
15762,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,"Olly, bring me my sword."
15763,janos slynt,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,"You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! (Everyone moves outside). Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken."
15764,janos slynt,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,"A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!"
15765,jon snow,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,"If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time."
15766,janos slynt,5,43,high sparrow,CASTLE BLACK_15,"(Trembling). I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! (Jon brings his sword up). My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid."
15767,olyvar,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"You have served us well, my son."
15768,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"Thank you, Father."
15769,olyvar,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,Which of the Seven will you worship today?
15770,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,The Maiden.
15771,olyvar,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,Where is the Maiden?
15772,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,And the Stranger.
15773,olyvar,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"(Leaning forward). Two is extra, you realize?"
15774,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"Yes, yes."
15775,olyvar,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't -
15776,lancel lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,You have profaned our faith. The faith of our fathers and forefathers.
15777,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,I am the High Septon of the -
15778,lancel lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,(Grabs his neck). You are a sinner. And you shall be punished.
15784,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"(To Cersei) Your Grace, (To Pycelle), Grandmaester, (To Mace) Lord Tyrell, (To Qyburn), uh…"
15785,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,It doesn't matter. (Mace sits down).
15786,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion."
15787,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,You were assaulted?
15788,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"I was, by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows’. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive."
15789,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.
15790,mace tyrell,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear."
15791,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother."
15792,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?
15793,pycelle,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,A man's private affairs ought to stay private!
15794,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"What do you want from us, High Septon?"
15795,high septon,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -"
15796,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?
15797,meryn trant,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace."
15798,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. (To a man at the bottom of some stairs). Where can I find the High Sparrow?"
15803,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?
15804,high sparrow,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. (Laughs). So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. (Prepares soup for the next person in line). The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me."
15806,high sparrow,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. (Prepares soup for the next person in line)."
15807,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,Why no shoes?
15808,high sparrow,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
15809,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?
15810,high sparrow,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so."
15811,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,(Smiles). Perhaps they're right.
15812,high sparrow,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon."
15813,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?"
15814,high sparrow,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade."
15815,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you."
15816,high sparrow,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.
15817,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"(After a moment). My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. (The High Sparrow looks up at her surprised). The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another."
15818,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,Your Grace.
15819,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. (Hands him the letter)."
15820,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"At once, Your Grace. (Walks to his desk)."
15821,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,How's your work coming along?
15822,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,Very well.
15823,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,You've made progress?
15824,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but…"
15825,cersei lannister,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediately""."
15826,qyburn,5,43,high sparrow,KING’S LANDING_15,"Shh. Easy, friend."
15827,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.
15828,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She’s suffered enough.
15829,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,I'll never hurt her. You have my word.
15830,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,"I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go."
15831,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.
15832,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,(Approaching). And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.
15833,ramsay bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,"Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. (Bows)."
15834,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,He seems pleased.
15835,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,Shouldn't he be?
15836,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,"(They begin walking). I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must."
15837,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,"I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue."
15838,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,Then I have delivered everything I've promised.
15839,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.
15840,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,"The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear."
15841,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,The Queen will be enraged.
15842,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,"Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day."
15843,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,"And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. (They stop, and Roose holds up a letter). A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale."
15844,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,"A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken."
15845,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,"I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?"
15846,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
15847,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?
15848,petyr baelish,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,"The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply."
15849,roose bolton,5,43,high sparrow,WINTERFELL_23,I'd like to read the reply.
15850,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
15851,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Volantis is a large city.
15852,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
15853,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.
15854,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,"Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse."
15855,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.
15856,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,(Walks over to him). I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
15857,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,It's a perfectly good face.
15858,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,I'm losing my mind.
15859,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,"If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that."
15860,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,"Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. (Pulls his hood up). What am I? (Varys shakes his head). One more drunk dwarf."
15861,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Slaves.
15862,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. (Shot of a man with a fly tattooed onto his cheek). Flies for dung shovelers. (Shot of a man with a hammer tattooed onto his cheek). Hammers for builders. (Shot of a man inspecting women with tears tattooed onto their cheeks). Tears for whores. Lest they forget.
15866,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,(Aside) We should keep moving.
15870,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.
15872,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. (Varys shushes him worriedly).
15874,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?
15875,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,(Covering his face). Come on. Let's find a brothel.
15877,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.
15878,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,"See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust."
15879,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Thank you.
15880,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Curious... hair. (She looks at him).
15882,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.
15883,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.
15887,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,"Well, (Watches her kiss the man), she's taken."
15888,varys,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Where're you going?
15889,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,I need to speak to someone with hair.
15890,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Hello?
15891,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Hello.
15892,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,You've got no drink.
15893,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,You've got no money.
15894,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,"Do I look like a man without money? (She looks at him incredulously). Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. (She laughs). But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? (Sits down). I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it."
15895,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.
15896,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,That’s because they’ve never met a queen.
15897,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,You're just saying that.
15898,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,"You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you."
15899,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Why?
15900,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Because you have a skeptical mind.
15901,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,"(Smiles). Alright, then. I'm warning you. We’re gonna have to wash you first."
15902,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Come on.
15903,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,"(After a moment). I'm, I'm sorry, I can't."
15904,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Of course you can. You're shy.
15905,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,I'm not.
15906,black haired prostitute,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,Have another drink.
15907,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,"Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I’ll go for a piss, that’s a start."
15908,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,"No need to worry, I was just - (Turns to see it’s not Varys, but Jorah). Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige."
15909,tyrion lannister,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -
15910,jorah mormont,5,43,high sparrow,VOLANTIS_1,I'm taking you to the Queen.
15911,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,Is that Estermont?
15913,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?
15914,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,"This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night."
15915,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,You ever been to Dorne?
15916,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,No.
15917,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.
15918,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,You should be happy to go back. (Drinks some water).
15919,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,"(Gets up, walking to his knife). There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. (Pulls out his knife from the sandbag). And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess."
15920,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,"We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,"
15921,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,(Incredulously) Your niece?
15922,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. (Sits down).
15923,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,That's why you're here.
15924,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,"I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one."
15925,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,Because I don't want to start a war.
15926,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.
15927,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,It has to be me.
15928,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,"(Gets up starts walking). If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, (Grabs some rope and walks back), who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -"
15929,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,It has to be me.
15930,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,"(Sheaths his sword). You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that."
15931,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,(Quietly) Varys set him free.
15932,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,"Well, if you ever see the little fucker, (Lays down), give him my regards."
15933,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT_1,"He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards."
15934,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown's debts. Given the expense of rebuilding the royal -
15935,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,How much can the Crown afford?
15936,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"With winter coming, half what they ask. Less."
15937,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?
15938,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"Well, House Tyrell could front the gold, and the the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter."
15939,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"You've already given us too much. (Gets up and walks to a window). No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank."
15940,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,Absolutely.
15941,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,In person.
15942,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"(After a moment, looks at her surprised). Me? (Qyburn smiles)."
15943,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified."
15944,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"I will be honored, Your Grace."
15945,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. (Smiling). He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.
15946,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,My very own Kingsguard? Please express -
15947,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"Safe travels, Lord Tyrell."
15948,mace tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"(Raises his hands). Of course, of course, (Gathers his belongings, and then gets up). I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos."
15949,pycelle,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.
15950,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,(Walking out). Not small enough.
15951,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?"
15952,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,No. (Smiles).
15953,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. (Smiles).
15954,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure. But the truth is, (Chuckles), I don't like the taste."
15955,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,Hmm.
15956,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,(After a moment). How may I serve?
15957,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.
15958,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods."
15959,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. (HS raises an eyebrow). In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven."
15960,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago."
15961,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy."
15962,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.
15963,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven."
15964,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"An honor I never expected. Or indeed, ever wished for."
15965,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"Which is why you were chosen. (HS smiles). You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most."
15966,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,All sinners are equal before the Gods.
15967,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,(Smiles. Continues after a moment). What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.
15968,high sparrow,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,May the Father judge him justly. (Smiles).
15970,olyvar,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,(Angrily). This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.
15975,loras tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,Get your hands off of me.
15976,lancel lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of Gods and men."
15977,loras tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,Who do you think you are?
15978,lancel lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,Justice. (Loras grunts and struggles).
15979,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,Why is my brother in a cell?
15980,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"I, I don't know. I, I didn't order it."
15981,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,We both know who did. (Walks away). You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.
15982,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,(Standing up). Are you saying my mother is behind this?
15983,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.
15984,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,Aren't you and mother getting along?
15985,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"(Scoffs). Oh, my sweet, sweet King. (Sits down). Do you have any affection for me at all?"
15986,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,(Takes her hand). Of course I do. You're my Queen.
15987,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.
15988,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,I'll set him free for you.
15989,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,Do you promise?
15990,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,I demand that Ser Loras be freed now!
15991,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,(Turns around). Did I arrest him?
15992,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"Well, no... But you armed the Faith Militant. You gave the High Sparrow an army."
15993,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. (Begins walking towards her desk). Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions."
15994,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,Then can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?
15995,cersei lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy."
15999,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?"
16005,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,We'll find another way.
16007,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,My Queen?
16008,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.
16009,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm. And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law."
16010,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,I'm going to speak to the High Sparrow.
16011,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,Are you? When?
16012,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,I--I don't know.
16013,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,You don't know?
16014,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,He was praying just now.
16015,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,(Walking out). I have to send word to Grandmother.
16016,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,Will you come back later? (Margaery stops).
16017,margaery tyrell,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,"I need to be with my family, Your Grace. (Continues walking)."
16018,tommen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,KING’S LANDING_17,Of course.
16019,selyse baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,You think highly of this boy.
16020,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,(To some of the men sparring). Good.
16021,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
16022,selyse baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,A bastard by some tavern slut.
16023,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way."
16024,selyse baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,I should have given you a son.
16025,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,Not your fault.
16026,selyse baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,Whose then? (Looks at their daughter Shireen). I gave you nothing but weakness. (Turns back). And deformity. (Stannis shakes his head).
16027,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,(Walking towards them). Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.
16028,selyse baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,My Lady.
16029,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,Her father is the Lord's chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins.
16030,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,You march on Winterfell soon?
16031,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,We must. To beat the snows.
16032,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again.
16033,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,I won't. I need you.
16034,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"You only need faith, my King."
16035,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"(Walking away). And you, my Lady, what do you need?"
16036,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,To serve my Lord.
16037,sam,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,Lord Ashford. (Jon signs). Lady Caulfield. (Jon signs). Lord Smallwood.
16038,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,Never even heard of these people.
16039,sam,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,They haven't heard of you either. (Jon signs). But we need men and they have some.
16040,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?
16041,sam,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"(Chuckles, looking at the next letter). More than Lord Wibberley."
16042,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,Not him.
16043,sam,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North."
16044,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,He murdered my brother.
16045,sam,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.
16046,sam,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"Apologies, my Lady."
16047,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,Lord Commander.
16048,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,How can I help you?
16049,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"Come with us when we ride south. (Walks forwards). None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? (Turns to Jon)."
16050,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
16051,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. (Walks in front of Jon).
16052,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions."
16053,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,No visions. No magic. Just life.
16054,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it."
16055,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows."
16056,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,I don't think Stannis would like that very much.
16057,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,Then we shouldn't tell him. (Starts unbuttoning Jon’s coat).
16058,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,I can't.
16059,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,Why?
16060,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,I swore a vow. (Melisandre looks at him incredulously). I loved another.
16061,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.
16062,jon snow,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,I know. But I still love her.
16063,melisandre,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
16064,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,Are you lonely?
16065,shireen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"(Turns around, holding something). Just bored."
16066,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.
16067,shireen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"(Looks up). Were you bored a lot, too?"
16068,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -"
16069,shireen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,I like it. (Walks to a table). I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. (Picks up an X from the table).
16070,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,Why do you say that?
16071,shireen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"She told me, ""I don't want to bring you."""
16072,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,She shouldn't have said that.
16073,shireen baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"Are you ashamed of me, father?"
16074,stannis baratheon,5,44,sons of the harpy,THE WALL_5,"When you were an infant, (Stands up and walks around his desk), the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, (Shireen smiles), and you pressed it to your cheek. (Looks down. Shireen’s smile drops). By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. (Walks to the table and adjusts the objects on it). I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. (Turns to her). Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. (Shireen smiles). I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. (Walks towards her). You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter."
16075,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,I thought I might find you here. (Sansa turns to him). Your Aunt Lyanna.
16076,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,"Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful."
16077,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,"I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?"
16078,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,"Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her."
16079,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,Come. (Takes her arm). Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. (They begin walking away).
16080,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,Dressed for riding?
16081,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,I am.
16082,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,Where are you going?
16083,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,King's Landing.
16084,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,King's Landing?
16085,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,Cersei sent for me. (They stop). We must not let her sniff out any trouble.
16086,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,You can't leave me here!
16087,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,"I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long."
16088,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,How do you know?
16089,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,"(They begin walking again). Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell."
16090,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,You don't know that.
16091,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,"I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne."
16092,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,You think he'll defeat the Boltons?
16093,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,"He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. (They stop). As it happens, I am a betting man."
16094,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,And if you're right?
16095,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,"Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North."
16096,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,"But I, I wouldn't… Wardeness of the North"
16097,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.
16098,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,"What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?"
16099,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,"Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours."
16100,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,I don't know how to do that.
16101,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.
16102,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,His father frightens me.
16103,petyr baelish,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,"He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you’ve learnt to maneuver from the very best. (Puts a hand on her shoulder). I return before too long. (Puts a hand behind her head). You'll be strong without me. (She nods, and he kisses her). The North will be yours. Do you believe me?"
16104,sansa stark,5,44,sons of the harpy,WINTERFELL_25,I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.
16105,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Breakfast.
16106,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,That would have been a shit way to die.
16107,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die."
16108,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.
16109,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
16110,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me."
16111,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Sounds like all the rest.
16112,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,What about you? What shit way would you choose?
16113,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune."
16114,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
16115,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?
16116,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,In the arms of the woman I love.
16117,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,She want the same thing?
16118,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Let's go.
16119,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"The captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?"
16120,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Pentoshi.
16121,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,And he's headed to Oldtown?
16122,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,As I said. Why?
16123,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?
16124,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,A bag of gold.
16125,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
16126,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,It was a heavy bag.
16127,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.
16128,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,How many you count?
16129,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Four.
16130,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,How many you think you can take?
16131,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"One, if he's slow."
16133,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"Fucked in the arse. (Both get up). Hiya! (The riders approach them). Morning, lads. Glad we found you."
16135,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Cooper. (Points to Jaime). This is Darnell.
16137,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.
16139,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really."
16140,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,I thought the sharks would get us. (Bronn looks at him).
16142,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,I could have sworn those were shark fins.
16143,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Dolphins maybe.
16145,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home."
16147,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,That one should be slow enough.
16148,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Nice move! (Jaime turns to him).
16149,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Luck.
16150,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,You had a wonderful teacher.
16151,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.
16152,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,First we need to bury these bodies.
16153,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Birds have to eat too.
16154,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war."
16155,bronn,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
16156,jaime lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"(Holding out his hand). I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really."
16157,tyene sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Nama!
16158,ellaria sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"Nym, Obara."
16159,obara sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Will it be war?
16160,ellaria sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves."
16161,obara sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.
16162,ellaria sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"We don't need an army to start a war. (Drinks water). Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them."
16163,nymeria,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,We may have a problem.
16164,obara sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne."
16165,ellaria sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war."
16166,tyene sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,(Walks towards her). I'm with you. Always. (Elaria puts a hand to her face).
16167,ellaria sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,Nym? (Nymeria nods). Obara?
16168,obara sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,"When I was a child, (Begins walking), Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl."
16169,obara sand,5,44,sons of the harpy,DORNE_1,(Smiles). I made my choice long ago.
16170,tyrion lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1,Thank you. (After a long pause). Who are you?
16171,jorah mormont,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1,Your captor.
16172,tyrion lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1,Do you have wine?
16173,jorah mormont,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1,No.
16174,tyrion lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1,I can't sleep without wine.
16175,jorah mormont,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1,Then stay awake.
16176,tyrion lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1,You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.
16177,jorah mormont,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1,I'm not taking you to your sister.
16178,tyrion lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1,You said you were taking me to the Queen.
16179,jorah mormont,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1,I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.
16180,tyrion lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1,(Chuckles). What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
16181,jorah mormont,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1,What business would you have with the Queen?
16182,tyrion lannister,5,44,sons of the harpy,EXT. BOAT AT SEA_1,"Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? (Holds out his hands expectantly. Jorah makes no move to respond). A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. (Jorah looks downtrodden). And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely."
16183,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,Everyone looks happy enough from up here. (Barristan chuckles). What?
16184,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,"I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing."
16185,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,Why?
16186,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,"He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them."
16187,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,He sang to them?
16188,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.
16189,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,And what did you do?
16190,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. (Daenerys looks surprised). Well he liked to see how much he could make.
16191,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,He was good?
16192,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,He was very good. Viserys never told you?
16193,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. (Sits down).
16194,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.
16195,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,And what did you do with the money?
16196,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,"Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. (They both laugh)."
16197,daario naharis,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,"(Entering). Your Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber."
16198,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,How many others are there?
16199,daario naharis,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,Fifty a hundred.
16200,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,"Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?"
16201,daario naharis,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.
16202,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,"I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me."
16203,barristan selmy,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,Your Grace. (Leaves).
16204,hizdahr zo loraq,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,All men must die. But not all can die in glory.
16205,missandei,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,Glory?
16206,hizdahr zo loraq,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,"Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have."
16207,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
16208,hizdahr zo loraq,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,"Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season."
16209,daenerys targaryen,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,I do not recognize this tradition.
16210,hizdahr zo loraq,5,44,sons of the harpy,YUNKAI_1,"Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. (Shots of Sons of the Harpy walking through tunnels with torches). Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start."
16212,hizdahr zo loraq,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_65,"I am so sorry, my queen. He was a good man."
16213,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_65,"""Barristan the Bold"" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks."
16214,daario naharis,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_65,"We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide."
16215,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_65,I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.
16216,hizdahr zo loraq,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_65,But... I'm the leader of my family.
16217,hizdahr zo loraq,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_65,"No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace!"
16218,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_65,(in Valyrian) Walk forward.
16220,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_65,(Valyrian) Another step.
16221,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_65,"(Valyrian) They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don’t. Children. Some say I should give up on them. (One of the men is mumbling). But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must."
16222,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_65,(Valyrian) But she does not give up on them.
16223,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_65,"(Valyrian) Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, (Looks at Hizdahr), maybe none of you are. Maybe, (Touching Hizdahr’s arm), I should let the dragons decide."
16224,hizdahr zo loraq,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_65,(Valyrian) All men must die.
16225,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,Unnamed Scene_65,Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.
16226,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"""And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure."" She sounds like quite a woman."
16227,aemon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying."
16228,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"Don't say that, Maester Aemon."
16229,aemon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing."
16230,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,Maester Aemon.
16231,aemon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,Lord Commander.
16232,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone."
16233,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,How are you feeling?
16234,aemon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death."
16235,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order."
16236,aemon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it."
16237,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,But you don't know what it is.
16238,aemon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born."
16239,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,Where are the rest of the free folk now? (Tormund scoffs). Where have they gone? (No response). Who leads them?
16240,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.
16241,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,What about you?
16242,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,Hard to lead when you're in chains.
16243,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,What if I unchained you?
16244,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,Why would you do that?
16245,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
16246,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
16247,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you."
16248,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,And now everything is going to change?
16249,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,It is.
16250,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,Why now?
16251,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"Because now, (Leans forward), I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."
16252,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"What would you have me do, (Leans forward), Lord Commander?"
16253,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,(Stands up). I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
16254,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,They won't kneel for you and neither will I.
16255,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
16256,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.
16257,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
16258,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,(Stands up). Easy thing to say to a man in chains.
16259,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
16260,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?
16261,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,Up on Storrold's Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
16262,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,We'll need ships.
16263,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
16264,tormund,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding won’t be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go."
16266,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing."
16268,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,Fewer.
16269,davos seaworth,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,What?
16270,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,Nothing.
16271,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,(Standing up) There is good farmland in the Gift. (Laughter). Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.
16273,alliser thorne,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.
16274,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,And we've slaughtered theirs.
16275,eddison tollett,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. (Men mumble in agreement). They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it."
16276,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that."
16277,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"Thank you. (Olly walks away). Olly. (He stops). If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right."
16278,olly,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them."
16279,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,It's not a trick.
16280,olly,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew."
16281,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.
16282,olly,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,"Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?"
16283,jon snow,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_17,No.
16284,podrick payne,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,She's far away from the Lannisters. This is her home. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
16285,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,(Turns around). Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.
16286,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Thank you. You've lived here a long time?
16288,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Did you know Lord Eddard?
16290,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.
16292,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.
16294,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Someone who swore to keep her safe.
16296,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Her mother.
16298,brienne of tarth,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?
16299,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Come back here. Myranda.
16300,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,I saw you staring at her.
16301,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.
16302,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,You said you'd marry me.
16303,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.
16304,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Do you think she's pretty?
16305,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Of course I do. I'm not blind.
16306,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you."
16307,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"Perhaps I'll marry, too."
16308,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"(Laughs). You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? (She tries to hit him, but he restrains her). You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?"
16309,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,(Smiles). Never.
16311,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"Oh, I don't need-"
16313,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,But who -
16315,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,I like your dress. Who made it for you?
16316,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,I made it myself.
16317,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Really?
16318,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"Who, who are you?"
16319,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? (Takes Sansa’s arm and inspects her sleeve). Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?"
16320,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,My mother. (Pulls away).
16321,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,I'm sorry for what happened to her.
16322,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Thank you.
16323,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"It's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her."
16324,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,I'd rather have a mother.
16325,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"I know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember."
16326,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Down there at the end.
16327,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,What is it?
16328,myranda,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it."
16329,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Theon?
16330,theon greyjoy,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,You shouldn't be here.
16331,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,You smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine.
16332,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Do you have something to tell me?
16333,theon greyjoy,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"No, my lord."
16334,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Reek.
16335,theon greyjoy,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,(Stuttering). She saw me.
16336,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Who?
16337,theon greyjoy,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.
16338,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,She saw you?
16339,theon greyjoy,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -"
16340,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Come here.
16341,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees."
16342,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Give me your hand.
16343,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,I forgive you.
16344,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady."
16345,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"Yes, thank you, my lord."
16346,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Allow me.
16347,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Mother.
16348,walda frey,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"Thank you, Ramsay."
16349,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"My lady, we are all a family, we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth."
16350,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,(Raises his cup). To your wedding.
16351,walda frey,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,(Raises her cup). To your wedding.
16352,walda frey,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.
16353,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.
16354,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"You're right. Very strange. More wine, please."
16355,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. (Theon begins pouring wine). I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?"
16356,theon greyjoy,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"(Turns around). Yes, master."
16357,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"That's his new name, Reek."
16358,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Why are you doing this?
16359,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? (He gestures Theon over). An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers."
16360,theon greyjoy,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"(After a moment, stuttering). I'm sorry."
16361,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye."
16362,theon greyjoy,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,I'm sorry.
16363,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Sorry about what?
16364,theon greyjoy,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,For killing your brothers.
16365,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. (Theon turns to leave). You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?"
16366,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"Yes, yes, very good."
16367,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Wonderful. (Sips wine).
16368,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together."
16369,walda frey,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,We're going to have a baby.
16370,sansa stark,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,I'm very happy for you.
16371,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy."
16372,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,How can you be sure?
16373,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Sure of what?
16374,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?
16375,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.
16376,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,So how did you manage it?
16377,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Manage what?
16378,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Getting her pregnant.
16379,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.
16380,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"Of course, but how did you find it?"
16381,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl."
16382,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,And if it's a boy?
16383,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,You're worried about your position.
16384,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.
16385,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,You've never asked me about your mother.
16386,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are."
16387,roose bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,"She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. (Stands up). But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. (After a moment). Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?"
16388,ramsay bolton,5,45,kill the boy,WINTERFELL_27,Yes.
16389,gilly,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,Is this every book there is?
16390,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,Every book there is?
16391,gilly,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,In the world.
16392,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually."
16393,gilly,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"Where you grew up, were there more books?"
16394,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
16395,gilly,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,Where's that?
16396,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,The Citadel? In Oldtown.
16397,gilly,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,I'm sorry I don't know things.
16398,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound."
16399,gilly,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.
16400,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,Well -
16401,gilly,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
16402,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,It's where they train the maesters.
16403,gilly,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,Like Maester Aemon?
16404,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you."
16405,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"Ah, Your Grace."
16406,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,You're Samwell Tarly?
16407,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"I am, Your Grace."
16408,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker."
16409,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"I did, Your Grace."
16410,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,How?
16411,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,With a dagger made of dragonglass.
16412,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,Dragonglass?
16413,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,What the maesters call obsidian -
16414,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?
16415,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass."
16416,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
16417,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"I've seen it, Your Grace."
16418,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,Seen what?
16419,sam,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,The army of the dead. And when they come -
16420,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"We have to know how to fight them. (After a moment). Keep reading, Samwell Tarly."
16421,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,It's time.
16422,davos seaworth,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men."
16423,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise."
16424,davos seaworth,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.
16425,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"No need, they're coming with us."
16426,davos seaworth,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -"
16427,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us."
16428,davos seaworth,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,"As you wish, Your Grace."
16429,shireen baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,(On horseback). Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?
16430,davos seaworth,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,Beg your pardon?
16431,shireen baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-
16432,davos seaworth,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.
16433,shireen baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,Is there going to be a battle?

16439,shireen baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,(Smiling). I promise.
16440,stannis baratheon,5,45,kill the boy,CASTLE BLACK_19,I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.

16444,missandei,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,(Valyrian) Three days.
16445,grey worm,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,Ser Barristan?
16446,grey worm,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,"(Valyrian) I failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen."
16447,missandei,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,"(Valyrian) You failed no one. You fought bravely. You’ll fight again. (In Common Tongue) Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known."
16448,grey worm,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,"This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid."
16449,missandei,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,All men fear death.
16450,grey worm,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,"No, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath."
16451,missandei,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.
16452,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,"If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?"
16453,missandei,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,"Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters."
16454,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,(Sitting down). You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?
16455,missandei,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,"I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. (Sitting down). I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see."
16456,hizdahr zo loraq,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,"My, my queen, please do not do this."
16457,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,"What about ""Valar Morghulis""?"
16458,hizdahr zo loraq,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. (Sniffles).
16459,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,"It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live."
16460,hizdahr zo loraq,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,"Yes, my queen."
16461,daenerys targaryen,5,45,kill the boy,MEEREN_1,"And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. (Hizdahr nods). Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees."
16462,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,"Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. (No response). Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen."
16463,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,We are.
16464,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.
16465,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,No wine.
16466,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,"I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not…"
16467,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.
16468,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,I am.
16469,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,Have you sailed this route before?
16470,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,No.
16471,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?
16472,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,I think you'll be plenty.
16473,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?
16474,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,No. But the pirates are.
16475,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,Oh.
16476,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -
16477,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,And then they weren't.
16478,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,"And then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"""
16479,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,"""The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned."""
16480,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,I would clap.
16481,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,"I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains."
16482,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,What was that?
16483,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!
16484,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,Get behind!
16485,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,"Mormont, cut me free! (Jorah falls into the water). Mormont!"
16486,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,Mormont! Mormont!
16487,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,(Faintly). Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.
16488,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?
16489,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,"(Shakes his head). You? (Jorah shakes his head). I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that."
16490,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,I suppose that's why they send them there.
16491,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,"It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. (Jorah spits). Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. (Jorah gets up). So what now?"
16492,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,"We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat."
16493,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,Without luck?
16494,jorah mormont,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,"We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?"
16495,tyrion lannister,5,45,kill the boy,SEA_1,That's the best idea you've had all day.

16503,waif,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Game?

16505,waif,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You tried already. You failed.
16506,arya stark,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I didn’t even know I was playing.

I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. I’ve been serving them ever since."

16519,jaqen h'ghar,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,And where did you come from?
16520,arya stark,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I’m the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.
16521,jaqen h'ghar,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,A lie.
16522,arya stark,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.
16523,jaqen h'ghar,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,A lie.
16524,arya stark,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.
16525,jaqen h'ghar,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,A lie.
16526,arya stark,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn’t. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him."

16530,jaqen h'ghar,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?

16532,arya stark,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I’m not playing this stupid game anymore!
16533,jaqen h'ghar,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,We never stop playing.
16534,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can’t live on berries and roots."
16535,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I can.
16536,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You’re not hungry?
16537,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Of course I’m hungry.
16538,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"You’re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met."
16539,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I am not your travelling companion.
16540,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,We are travelling together. In each other’s company. Therefore…
16541,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Do you ever shut up?
16542,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I sailed from King’s Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.
16543,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Why?
16544,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
16545,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I’m sure you’ve visited many brothels in many cities.
16546,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn’t commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.
16547,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man."
16548,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,What do you know about my father?
16549,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”"
16550,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You didn’t know. I’m sorry. I am.
16551,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,How?
16552,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I only know what I heard
16553,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,How?
16554,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.
16555,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,We better keep moving.
16557,arya stark,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Valar dohaeris.
16560,arya stark,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"I know. Don’t be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me."
16561,arya stark,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I’ve devoted my life to him now. You don’t want to hurt anymore. Drink.
16562,jaqen h'ghar,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?"
16563,jaqen h'ghar,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.
16564,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert’s Rebellion."
16565,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Do you believe in anything?
16566,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I believe in many things.
16567,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?"
16568,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,No.
16569,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I’d find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?"
16570,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,No.
16571,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,It's hard to be a cynic after that.
16572,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen.
16573,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,No it doesn’t.
16574,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?"
16575,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,First we have to conquer the world.
16576,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"We? Alright, let’s assume your dreams come true. She’s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"
16577,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Then she rules.
16578,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That’s justice?
16579,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,She is the rightful heir.
16580,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?"
16581,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Shh! It’s a slave ship
16582,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Why is it anchored?
16583,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,They probably came ashore for--
16584,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,--water.
16585,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Got a lot of fight in you, huh?"
16586,slaver,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Salt mines.
16587,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.
16588,slaver,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,What about the dwarf?
16589,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Worthless. Cut his throat.
16590,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let’s discuss this!"
16591,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf’s cock has magic powers.
16592,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can’t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?"
16593,slaver,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,It will be a dwarf-sized cock.
16594,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Guess again.
16595,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.
16596,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
16597,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"We’re bound to Volantis, not Slaver’s Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits."
16598,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"The fighting puts in Mereen! You’re in luck then, you’re about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms."
16599,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,(looks at Jorah) Him.
16600,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Him? He’s got to be 60 years old.
16601,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Sure, he’s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!"
16602,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Is that true?
16603,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself."
16604,tyrion lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,The Kingslayer!
16605,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Jousting. You’re talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.
16606,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.
16607,malko,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Liar.
16608,jorah mormont,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"It’s no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver’s Bay, put a sword in my hand, I’ll prove my worth."
16609,lancel lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Lord Baelish.
16610,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Yes? (Lancel approaches him) Lancel Lannister.
16611,lancel lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.
16612,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,That’s quite a family to abandon.
16613,lancel lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run."
16614,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Well done.
16615,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I’m here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I’ll be delayed?
16616,lancel lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You’ll find that there’s little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King’s Landing."
16617,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining."
16618,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Do you think it’s wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?"
16619,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
16620,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.
16621,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,The King’s orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras’ perversion?
16622,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,House Tyrell won’t tolerate these insults.
16623,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"House Tyrell won’t tolerate it? I’m the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys."
16624,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,One’s choice of companion is a curious thing.
16625,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you’re still in mourning.
16626,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
16627,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."
16628,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
16629,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
16630,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
16631,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Good. (Cersei gets up) If there’s nothing else.
16632,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn’t trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell."
16633,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,That’s not possible.
16634,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen."
16635,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
16636,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
16637,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,We were fools to trust a turncloak.
16638,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
16639,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
16640,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"I would counsel patience, your grace."
16641,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor."
16642,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they’re done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."
16643,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn."
16644,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force."
16645,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
16646,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Ser Jaime, then."
16647,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I’ve no idea when he’ll be back.
16648,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow."
16649,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man."
16650,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"You wouldn’t risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?"
16651,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,And if you succeed?
16652,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Name me Warden of the North.
16653,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I’ll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
16654,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I’ll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
16655,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,And I’ll l know you’re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark’s head on a spike.
16656,petyr baelish,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,As I said. I live to serve.
16657,trystane martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I’m going to ask him tomorrow.
16658,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,What if he says no?
16659,trystane martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,He won’t. You’ve waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?
16660,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you…"
16661,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,We can’t. Not yet.
16662,trystane martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Why not?
16663,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You know why not. Someone will see.
16664,trystane martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.
16665,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?
16666,trystane martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I like the way your eyes go squinty when you’re jealous.
16667,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"They don’t go squinty, and you didnt answer the question."
16668,doran martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.
16669,areo hotah,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Yes, my prince."
16670,doran martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.
16671,areo hotah,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I remember how.
16672,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman’s blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman’s wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...
16673,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Alright, thats enough."
16674,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I’m coming to the best part.
16675,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,We’re trying to blend in. We don’t want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
16676,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,This song really is all about the ending.
16677,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,It can wait. Up there.
16678,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,That’s the Water Gardens.
16679,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Once we got the princess, then what?"
16680,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I like to improvise.
16681,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,That explains the golden hand.
16682,ellaria sand,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn."
16683,sand snakes,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,For Oberyn.
16684,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Well, she’s made herself at home."
16685,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Myrcella.
16686,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Uncle Jaime? I don’t understand, what are you doing here?"
16687,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Let’s speak in private.
16688,trystane martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I am Trystane Martell.
16689,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Trystane is my intended.
16690,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Excellent. Good to meet you.
16691,trystane martell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"We weren’t expecting you, Ser Jaime."
16692,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Why don’t you let them have some time alone, son?"
16693,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Let’s not do something stupid.
16694,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,No!
16695,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,That was something stupid.
16696,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"We have to go, Myrcella, now."
16697,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You hurt him!
16698,jaime lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"You’ll be fine, I promise, but we have to--"
16699,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Oh for fuck’s sake.
16700,obara sand,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You’re coming with me.
16701,myrcella baratheon,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I don’t want to!
16702,obara sand,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"I wasn’t asking, princess."
16703,areo hotah,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Drop you weapons!
16704,obara sand,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?
16705,areo hotah,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Drop your weapons!
16706,areo hotah,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"When you were whole, it would have been a good fight."
16707,bronn,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You fight pretty good for a little girl.
16709,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on."
16710,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Rumors and gossip, that’s all they got. It’s theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King’s Landing there’d be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."
16711,margaery tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Everyone knew about him and Renly.
16712,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
16713,margaery tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,But he was the king’s brother.
16714,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"And Loras is the queen’s brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable."
16715,margaery tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Cersei is behind this.
16716,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister."
16717,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Your Grace, I have travelled a long way."
16718,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You must be exhausted.
16719,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren’t writing anything."
16720,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns."
16721,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
16722,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Beg your pardon.
16723,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I know you’re behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
16724,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
16725,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You’ll get your apology when I get Loras.
16726,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
16727,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
16728,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
16729,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Do you expect the alliance to continue after you’ve thrown our future into prison?
16730,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"As I said, i didn’t imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--"
16731,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,What veil?
16732,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
16733,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I didn’t trust your father. I didn’t particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
16734,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I’m sure they don’t. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we’ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna."
16735,high sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
16736,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I don’t pay attention to rumors.
16737,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis’ army closed in"
16738,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,He was my friend. He was my king.
16739,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Wasn’t Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly."
16740,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I was wrong to support Renly’s claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.
16741,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Wearing Renly’s armor.
16742,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Why does it matter what I wore?
16743,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy."
16744,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Of course I deny them.
16745,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You never lay with Renly Baratheon.
16746,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Never.
16747,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Nor any other man.
16748,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Never.
16749,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,That will be all Ser Loras.
16750,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Well I think that’s quite enough of that.
16751,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.
16752,margaery tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You call me forward?
16753,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Yes. We have some questions for you.
16754,margaery tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I am the queen.
16755,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"You are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest."
16756,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,How do you respond to these charges against your brother?
16757,margaery tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,They are lies.
16758,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,All of them?
16759,margaery tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,All of them.
16760,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?"
16761,margaery tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Yes, I swear it."
16762,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Thank you, your grace."
16763,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Do you know this man?
16764,olyvar,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden."
16765,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,How did you come to meet?
16766,olyvar,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.
16767,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,And what occurred in his chamber?
16768,olyvar,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,We engaged in intimate relations.
16769,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,You laid with him?
16770,olyvar,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,That night and many others.
16771,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Liar! He’s a liar!
16772,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Is there anyone else who can support your claim?
16773,olyvar,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn’t seem surprised."
16774,cersei lannister,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
16775,olyvar,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,"He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne."
16776,loras tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,Liar!
16777,olenna tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,What are you doing? Let us pass.
16778,sparrow,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.
16779,margaery tyrell,5,46,unbowed unbent unbroken,Unnamed Scene_66,What?

16972,daario naharis,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Do you think I’m petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?
16973,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I do.
16974,daario naharis,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,You’re right. My motivations are entirely impure.
16975,daario naharis,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Doesn’t make me wrong.
16976,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"You told me yourself, I can’t fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice."
16977,daario naharis,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Everyone has a choice. Even slaves have a choice. Death or slavery.
16978,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,So what else can I do?
16979,daario naharis,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Marry me instead.
16980,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn’t."
16981,daario naharis,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Why not? You’re our queen, you can do as you like."
16982,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,No. I can’t
16983,daario naharis,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Then you are the only person in Mereen who’s not free.
16984,daario naharis,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"I know I’m here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?"
16985,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Of course
16986,daario naharis,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all."
16987,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I am a queen. Not a butcher.
16988,daario naharis,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,All rulers are either butchers or meat.
16989,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he’s got."
16990,high sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"It’s not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I’ll admit."
16991,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.
16992,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,You should have the decency to kneel before the gods
16993,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Don’t spar with me little fellow.
16994,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"For me, it’s the knees. You?"
16995,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Hips.
16996,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Huh.
16997,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"A man of the people, is that your game? It’s an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei’s dirty work for her."
16998,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,The people always do the dirty work.
16999,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away."
17000,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,A useful talent.
17001,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I’m here for my grandson and granddaughter.
17002,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished."
17003,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Don’t you walk away from me.
17004,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"You don’t give commands here, Lady Olenna."
17005,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,What is it you want? Gold? I’ll make you the richest septon who ever lived.
17006,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,What then?
17007,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I’m telling you a simple truth"
17008,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
17009,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don’t have one in your library I’ll give you my own.
17010,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I’ve read the seven pointed star.
17011,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Then you’ll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.
17012,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?"
17013,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Yes. The Gods’ laws must be applied to all equally.
17014,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"If it’s equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I’ll make sure the hungry know who to blame,"
17015,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few…"
17016,squire,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Lady Olenna.
17017,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love."
17018,tommen baratheon,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,She’s in a prison cell and there’s nothing I can do. I am the king! The queen is in prison and there’s nothing I can do!
17019,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control."
17020,tommen baratheon,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I’ll call in the army. I’ll take back the sept and kill every last one of them. I’ll start a war if I have to.
17021,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.
17022,tommen baratheon,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I love her. I love her. I can’t help her.
17023,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.
17024,tommen baratheon,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I will speak to the high sparrow. There must be something--
17025,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
17026,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Your happiness is all I want in this world
17027,tommen baratheon,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I know.
17028,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"No you don’t. You can’t possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy."
17029,areo hotah,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess’s wellbeing.
17030,myrcella baratheon,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,You looked different when I left. You had more hair.
17031,jaime lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,And more hands. How’s Trystane?
17032,myrcella baratheon,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,He’ll be alright.
17033,jaime lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I’m sorry for that. It wasn’t supposed to happen that way.
17034,myrcella baratheon,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Why is it happening at all?
17035,jaime lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Your mother’s worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I’ve come to take you home.
17036,myrcella baratheon,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"This is my home, this has been my home for years. I didn’t want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now she’s forcing me to go back?"
17037,jaime lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.
17038,myrcella baratheon,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"It’s not complicated at all, it’s simple. I love Trystane, I’m going to marry him, and we’re staying right here."
17039,jaime lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I don’t understand.
17040,myrcella baratheon,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Of course you don’t! You don’t know me!
17041,bronn,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman’s taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife! Yes I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife!"
17042,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,He’s got a good voice.
17043,obara sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,We’re lucky he’s a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble.
17044,bronn,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,It’s against my code to hurt a woman.
17045,obara sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,It’s amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.
17046,bronn,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I wouldn’t say you beat me.
17047,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,How’s your arm?
17048,bronn,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Wonderful. Wouldn’t feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
17049,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,You think you’re leaving Dorne?
17050,bronn,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
17051,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Thank you.
17052,bronn,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I said Dornish women. I didn’t say you.
17053,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I’m not the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen?
17054,bronn,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I’ve seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.
17055,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Name one more beautiful than I am.
17056,bronn,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Well now, in King’s Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous..."
17057,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,There was a what? In King’s Landing you were saying.
17058,bronn,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Was I?
17059,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,There was a woman more beautiful than I am.
17060,bronn,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Was there? My memory’s not what it was earlier.
17061,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,How’s your arm now?
17062,bronn,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.
17063,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,And how about your head?
17064,bronn,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,My head… You don’t even wanna know what’s going on in…
17065,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Your nose is bleeding.
17066,bronn,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,It’s nothing. It’s the dry air.
17067,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death."
17068,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,The only antidote. Who’s the most beautiful woman in the world?
17069,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Sorry? Who?
17070,bronn,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,You.
17071,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Don’t drop it.
17072,tyene sand,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I think you’re very handsome as well.
17073,petyr baelish,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I’m sorry about the locale.
17074,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,No you’re not.
17075,petyr baelish,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,It felt like the safest place.
17076,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Not for your clientele, clearly."
17077,petyr baelish,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn’t exist until we invented them."
17078,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"You’ve always been rather impressed with yourself, haven’t you?"
17079,petyr baelish,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,The past is the past. The future is all that’s worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
17080,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Don’t pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you’d return to the capital once things started going wrong."
17081,petyr baelish,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I promise you..
17082,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they’ll never even find what’s left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?"
17083,petyr baelish,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Cersei summoned me to King’s Landing. I dared not refuse her.
17084,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,And what did she want?
17085,petyr baelish,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."
17086,olenna tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,What kind of gift?
17087,petyr baelish,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.
17093,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.
17094,hizdahr zo loraq,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence."
17099,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I think I’ve seen enough.
17100,hizdahr zo loraq,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Your Grace, it’s a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged."
17101,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I’ve sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
17102,tyrion lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,What are you doing?
17103,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Get him out of my sight.
17104,jorah mormont,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift."
17105,tyrion lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,It’s true. He has.
17106,daenerys targaryen,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Who are you?
17107,tyrion lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"I am the gift. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister."
17108,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It’s quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."
17109,margaery tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I know you did this.
17110,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
17111,margaery tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You’re not very good at those, I’m afraid. Perhaps that’s why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me."
17112,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,You’re upset. You’re not thinking clearly. I’ll visit again when you’ve had a chance to calm down.
17113,margaery tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I don’t want to see you again.
17114,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"I do hope you change your mind about that. I’ve been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."
17115,margaery tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Leave.
17116,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Yes, I’m afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever."
17117,margaery tyrell,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Get out you hateful bitch!
17118,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"Sleep well, sister."
17119,high sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Thank you. (to Cersei) You saw her?
17120,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Yes.
17121,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,And?
17122,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
17123,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
17124,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Who will stand judge?
17125,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
17126,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Will you be one of them?
17127,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I will.
17128,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
17129,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Then they will be at The Mother’s mercy.
17130,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,What does The Mother’s mercy entail?
17131,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."
17132,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
17133,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King’s Landing?
17134,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I think I may have heard at one point.
17135,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.
17136,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Who carved this altar do you know?
17137,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,I’m afraid i don’t.
17138,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,No one does. There’s no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn’t inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.
17139,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,"A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird."
17140,sparrow,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,And he has much to say about you.
17141,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Move. Let me go immediately.
17142,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!
17143,cersei lannister,5,47,the gift,Unnamed Scene_67,Look at me. Look at my face. It’s the last thing you’ll see before you die.
17144,jorah mormont,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,"Your Grace, I want to say--"
17145,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
17146,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,If only I were otherwise.
17147,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn’t I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
17148,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
17149,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
17150,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It’s too soon to know if you deserve my service.
17151,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,If you’d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
17152,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,"When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
17153,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
17154,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
17155,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,I have a very large army and very large dragons.
17156,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
17157,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,So you want to advise me. Very well. (looks to Jorah) What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
17158,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,I know.
17159,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,Why should the people trust a queen who can’t keep her promises?
17160,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,"Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can’t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
17161,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
17162,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,"Yes, many opportunities."
17163,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,And did he?
17164,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,No. Not until forced to do so.
17165,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,"He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
17166,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,So I should kill him?
17167,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,"A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you’re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you’re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
17168,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
17169,septa,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,Confess.
17170,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,My son. Let me speak to--
17171,septa,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,Confess. I meant it.
17172,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,My face will be the last thing you see before--
17173,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,Unnamed Scene_68,"My name is Lana. I’m an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more."
17174,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,EXT. BRAAVOS - MARKET_1,"Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"
17175,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade."
17176,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.
17177,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,How will she serve him?
17178,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
17179,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,What will she do there?
17180,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,She will see.
17181,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,See what?
17182,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her."
17183,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Oysters, clams and cockles!"
17184,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
17185,thin man,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Your oysters fresh?
17186,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Best in the city.
17187,thin man,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You wouldn’t lie to an old man would you?
17188,thin man,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.
17190,thin man,5,48,hardhome,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Can’t do it.
17192,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
17193,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
17194,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,A girl tells a man that she has seen.
17195,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money."
17196,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn’t have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?"
17197,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,The Many Faced God. You said you didn’t know what I would see at the docks.
17198,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
17199,arya stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,And then what?
17200,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,A gift for the Thin Man.
17201,waif,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,She is not ready.
17202,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Perhaps she is, perhaps she’s not."
17203,waif,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,And if she’s not?
17204,jaqen h'ghar,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,It is all the same to the Many Faced God.
17205,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.
17206,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,The charges?
17207,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert."
17208,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,All lies.
17209,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you’ll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason."
17210,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I wish you’d said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
17211,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"I’m afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council."
17212,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Tell him I need to speak to him.
17213,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I implored him to visit you but he would not.
17214,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
17215,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Your arrest, and Queen Margaery’s arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched."
17216,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
17217,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"I tried my grace, he wouldn’t see me. He wouldn’t see anyone."
17218,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I can’t stay here.
17219,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"There is a way, Your Grace. A way out."
17220,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won’t. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness."
17221,qyburn,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Goodbye my queen. The work continues.
17222,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Why. Why Theon.
17223,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
17224,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?"
17225,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
17226,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Good. If it weren’t for you I’d still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would."
17227,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
17228,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"They weren’t “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you’d know them since they were born."
17229,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,They weren’t. They were only--
17230,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Only what?
17231,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I can’t..
17232,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Tell me!
17233,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"I can’t, not unless the master says..."
17234,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Tell me, they weren’t what?!"
17235,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,They weren’t...
17236,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,They weren’t Bran and Rickon! I couldn’t find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
17237,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You didn’t…?
17238,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
17239,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I can’t talk to you anymore.
17240,sansa stark,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--"
17241,theon greyjoy,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Not Theon, Reek!"
17243,roose bolton,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"And how high can Stannis’ horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny."
17244,roose bolton,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You disagree?
17245,ramsay bolton,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Stannis isn’t from the North. You are, father. I think you’re missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders."
17246,roose bolton,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,And what do you recommend?
17247,ramsay bolton,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows."
17248,roose bolton,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can’t touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn’t get an army through if we wanted to.
17249,ramsay bolton,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I don’t need an army. I need 20 good men.
17250,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,So have you decided yet? Whether I’m worthy of your service?
17251,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Have you decided yet whether you’re going to have me killed?
17252,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,It’s probably my safest option.
17253,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I can see why you would think so. It’s what your father would have done.
17254,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,And what would your father do?
17255,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I’d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
17256,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Is that why you killed him?
17257,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Some day if you decide not to execute me, I’ll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we’ll need more wine than this."
17258,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
17259,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
17260,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I’m terrible?
17261,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I’ve heard stories.
17262,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
17263,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
17264,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Which kind is that?
17265,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
17266,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
17267,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
17268,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Perhaps it won’t come to that.
17269,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,It’s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
17270,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Varys? King Robert’s spy master?
17271,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
17272,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
17273,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn’t have to do. I suspect he’s the main reason you weren’t slaughtered in your crib.
17274,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,But you trust him?
17275,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
17276,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,The brother who killed my father.
17277,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,That’s the one.
17278,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
17279,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
17280,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I’m not going to kill you.
17281,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,No? Banish me?
17282,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,No.
17283,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"So if I’m not going to be murdered, and I’m not going to be banished..."
17284,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You’re going to advise me. (takes his wine cup) While you can still speak in complete sentences.
17285,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Advise you on what?
17286,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,How to get what I want.
17287,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
17288,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,If I want jokes I’ll get myself a proper fool.
17289,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I’m not entirely joking. There’s more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
17290,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I fought so that no child born into Slaver’s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
17291,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
17292,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,The common people.
17293,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen. Here in Slaver’s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won’t back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won’t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
17294,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They’re all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
17295,tyrion lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,It’s a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You’re not the first person to have dreamt it.
17296,daenerys targaryen,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I’m not going to stop the wheel. I’m going to break the wheel.
17297,jorah mormont,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.
17299,jorah mormont,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I’ve been flogged if it makes you happy. I’m the best you’ve got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
17301,jorah mormont,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
17302,septa,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Thirsty? Confess.
17303,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"I’ll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
17304,septa,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Confess.
17305,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.
17306,septa,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Confess.
17307,cersei lannister,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die."
17308,gilly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Does it hurt?
17309,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,No.
17310,gilly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Good.
17311,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,How are you?
17312,gilly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I’m not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.
17313,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You know what I mean.
17314,gilly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I’m good.
17315,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Are you scared?
17316,gilly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,A little.
17317,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Me too.
17318,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Who’s there?
17319,olly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Olly.
17320,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Come in.
17321,olly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I heard what happened.
17322,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It’s only natural.
17323,olly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Figured you were hungry.
17324,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You’re a good lad.
17325,olly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Wanted to ask you something. (Olly looks at Gilly) If you’ve got the time.
17326,gilly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I need to check on baby Sam.
17327,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Now then. How can I help?
17328,olly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,It’s about the Lord Commander.
17329,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Yes?
17330,olly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,He’s going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.
17331,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,We’ve been fighting them for years.
17332,olly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,This wasn’t a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why’s he saving them?
17333,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."
17334,olly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"The one he’s travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village."
17335,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Olly...
17336,olly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,How can he trust him?
17337,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"I’ve seen the army of the dead. I’ve seen the white walkers, and they’re coming for us, for all the living. And when it’s time we’ll need every last man we can find."
17338,olly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?
17339,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Jon’s taking a risk, but he has to. We don’t stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
17340,olly,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You believe that?
17341,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,With all my heart.
17342,sam,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Try not to worry Olly. I’ve been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.
17343,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You trust me Jon Snow?
17344,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Does that make me a fool?
17345,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,We are fools together now.
17346,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Lord of Bones. Been a long time.
17348,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,War.
17350,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.
17352,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I’m not giving an order.
17354,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,He’s not my prisoner.
17356,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,We’re allies.
17358,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I don’t fight for the crows.
17359,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,We’re not here to fight. We’re here to talk.
17361,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Gather the elders and let’s talk.
17362,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,My name’s Jon Snow. I’m Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. We’re not friends. We’ve never been friends. We won’t become friends today. This isn’t about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what’s out there.
17363,karsi,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You built that wall to keep us out.
17364,loboda,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?
17365,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,In normal times we wouldn’t. But these aren’t normal times. The white walkers don’t care if a man’s Free Folk or Crow. We’re all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
17366,karsi,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe."
17367,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,It’s not a trick. It’s a gift for those who join us.
17368,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Dragonglass. A man of the Night’s Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
17369,loboda,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You saw this?
17370,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,No. But I trust the man.
17371,karsi,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,There are old stories about Dragonglass.
17372,loboda,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.
17373,karsi,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,And with the things we’ve seen you don’t believe them?
17374,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
17375,karsi,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Come with you where?
17376,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,There are good lands south of the wall.  The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
17377,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night’s Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We’re prepared to give you that new life."
17378,karsi,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,If…?
17379,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
17380,loboda,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Where is Mance?
17381,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,He died.
17382,loboda,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,How?
17383,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I put an arrow through his heart.
17384,loboda,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.
17385,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt’s orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that’s what we need today"
17386,karsi,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows."
17387,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"I’m not asking you to forget your dead. I’ll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I’m asking you to think about your children now. They’ll never have children of their own if we don’t band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can’t stop them. The Night’s Watch can’t stop them. And all the southern kings can’t stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we’ll give the fuckers a fight."
17388,karsi,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"You vouch for this man, Tormund?"
17389,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"He’s prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He’s young, but he knows how to lead. He didn’t have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him."
17390,loboda,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.
17391,karsi,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"So would mine, but fuck 'em, they’re dead."
17392,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,This is the way.
17393,wildling elder,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I’m with Tormund. We stay here we’re dead men. At least with King Crow there’s a chance.
17395,loboda,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they’re gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That’s our enemy. That has always been our enemy."
17396,karsi,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I fucking hate Thenns.
17397,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,How many are with us? 5000?
17398,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,I’m not good at counting.
17399,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,We’re leaving too many behind.
17400,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.
17401,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,And he knew them better than I ever will.
17402,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,They’re running out of food and there’s nothing to hunt. They’ll come around.
17403,karsi,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Johnna is gonna look after you. She’s in charge, you listen to her."
17405,karsi,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"I need to get the old folks on the boats. I’m right behind you, I promise. (she kisses them on the forehead) Go on."
17406,wun wun,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Lokh kif rukh?
17407,loboda,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Shut the gate.
17408,loboda,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Shut the gate!!
17410,loboda,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Ready your arrows!
17411,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Get in line! Get in line!
17412,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Hold the line! Hold the line!
17414,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Get them to the ship and come back for me!
17416,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Now!
17417,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You should be on one of those boats.
17418,karsi,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you’re not there ?
17419,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You have my word. I’ve given orders.
17420,karsi,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Don’t think you’re gonna be there to enforce those orders !
17421,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"If they get through, everyone dies !"
17422,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Night’s Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!
17423,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,The Dragonglass!
17424,loboda,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"You’re with me, lad! Now!"
17425,loboda,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Get the glass.
17426,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,The Dragonglass!
17427,eddison tollett,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Fuck the glass! We’re gonna die here.
17428,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Go! Go! Go!
17429,tormund,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,"Wun Wun, to the sea."
17430,jon snow,5,48,hardhome,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Let’s go now! Now!
17431,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--"
17432,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Horses?
17433,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"We’re still getting a count, but hundreds are dead."
17434,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
17435,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
17436,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Put last night’s guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them."
17437,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Unless there’s a thaw, we can’t press forward to Winterfell, and we don’t have enough food to get us back to Castle Black."
17438,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,We’re not returning to Castle Black.
17439,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can’t march forward, and we won’t march back…"
17440,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Have the dead horses butchered for meat.
17441,alliser thorne,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Open the gates.
17442,jon snow,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,It was a failure.
17443,sam,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,It wasn’t.
17444,jon snow,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"I went to save them, I failed."
17445,sam,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"You didn’t fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else."
17446,jon snow,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I don’t think that fact’s lost on them.
17447,alliser thorne,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed."
17448,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"You sent for me, Your Grace."
17449,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I’m sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I’ll make sure the Night’s Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes."
17450,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Your Grace, you’ve named me your Hand."
17451,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Yes.
17452,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"The King’s Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war."
17453,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"You’re not abandoning me, you’re obeying a command."
17454,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
17455,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn’t name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don’t come back empty handed."
17456,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me."
17457,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,My family stays with me.
17458,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.
17459,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,My family stays with me.
17460,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,What’s this one now?
17461,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"""The Dance of Dragons"
17462,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Well that sounds like a proper story.
17463,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection."
17464,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield."
17465,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,And burnt him to a crisp.
17466,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess."
17467,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Do you like it?
17468,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,He’s beautiful.
17469,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Thank you.
17470,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You’re very welcome.
17471,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?"
17472,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Of course I will.
17473,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,But why am I getting a present?
17474,davos seaworth,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. (beat) I’ll be gone for a few days, Princess. I’ll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I’m back."
17475,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You’ll just have to read it yourself.
17476,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Prince Doran. (bows)
17477,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit."
17478,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Princess Myrcella.
17479,myrcella baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Uncle.
17480,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,What a lovely dress.
17481,myrcella baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You don’t like it?
17482,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You must be cold.
17483,myrcella baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.
17484,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Prince Trystane. How’s your jaw?
17485,trystane martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,A fleabite.
17486,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,What are you doing in Dorne?
17487,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella."
17488,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.
17489,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,We received a threatening message. The princess’s necklace in the jaws of a viper.
17490,myrcella baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,That necklace was stolen from my room.
17491,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
17492,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,We can’t behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I’ve seen war. I’ve seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I’ve seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don’t want to lead my people into that hell.
17493,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters."
17494,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"And that is precisely what we are doing. (raises glass) Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms."
17495,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,King Tommen insists on his sister’s return to the capital?
17496,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I’m afraid he does.
17497,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"I cannot disobey my King’s command. (Ellaria glares at Doran) She will return with you to King’s Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand."
17498,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I accept.
17499,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council."
17500,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You have my word.
17501,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,The word of a Kingslayer.
17502,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,No wonder you can’t stand. You have no spine.
17503,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won’t."
17504,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,May I inquire into the fate of my man?
17505,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King’s Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?"
17506,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it’s me.
17507,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he’s to rule one day. I’ll let him decide.
17508,trystane martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.
17509,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You’re a good man.
17510,trystane martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,On one condition.
17511,nymeria,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Why do we play? I’m better than you, I’ll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don’t think, I can’t recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- (slaps) -- pain? That one hurt didn’t it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister."
17512,tyene sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You’re going to miss.
17513,nymeria,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I never miss.
17514,tyene sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You will. You’re thinking too much. Now you’re nervous. “What if she’s right?”
17515,nymeria,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Luck.
17516,tyene sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Now it’s my turn.
17517,nymeria,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You’re too slow. You’ve always been too slow.
17518,bronn,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?
17519,areo hotah,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You’ll find out very soon.
17520,tyene sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?"
17521,bronn,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,The most beautiful woman in the world.
17522,tyene sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,And that’s the truth!
17523,nymeria,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Slut.
17524,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
17525,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,
17526,bronn,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Only the one.
17527,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I believe you’ve already met Prince Trystane.
17528,bronn,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Prince. Sorry about the other day.
17529,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He’s agreed to grant you your freedom.
17530,bronn,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I’m glad to hear it. The pie looks good.
17531,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,There was one condition.
17532,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Perhaps some soup instead?
17533,arya stark,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--"
17535,arya stark,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!"
17536,thin man,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Come on.
17537,thin man,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Some oysters, girl! I’m talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!"
17538,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free."
17539,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.
17540,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,And how goes the harvest in the Reach?
17541,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I’ll be sure to send the Arbor’s finest your way."
17542,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I’m afraid I don’t partake.
17543,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course."
17544,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.
17545,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.
17546,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Most unfortunate for the glovers.
17547,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble."
17548,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell."
17549,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You are the world's best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.
17550,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I’m afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
17551,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?"
17552,banker,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I don't have that gift.
17553,mace tyrell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"It's not a gift, it’s a skill, anyone can learn it. “So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown…”"
17554,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I thought that old shit would never stop singing.
17556,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king."
17557,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos."
17559,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Oh, I’m buying. But I never was good at sharing."
17560,brothel keeper,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Sell your fish somewhere else.
17563,arya stark,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Three coppers.
17564,jon snow,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Here’s a silver because the lady likes you.
17565,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Too old.
17566,head prostitute,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Brea.
17567,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Too old.
17569,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Too old.
17570,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Do you have what I want or not?
17576,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Good.
17577,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I’ll tell you when we’re done.
17578,meryn trant,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You’ll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.
17582,jaqen h'ghar,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,And?
17583,arya stark,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,The Thin Man wasn’t hungry today.
17584,jaqen h'ghar,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Perhaps that’s why the man is thin.
17585,arya stark,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Tomorrow.
17586,jaqen h'ghar,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Tomorrow.
17587,jaqen h'ghar,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,A girl has work to do.
17588,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die."
17589,doran martell,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I believe in second chances. I don’t believe in third chances.
17590,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You write like a 7 year old.
17591,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
17592,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,He didn’t try to make you pay?
17593,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Then maybe he’s changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you’ll be bringing her daughter home
17594,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,She will.
17595,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"You love her very much, don’t you?"
17596,jaime lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Of course, she’s my niece."
17597,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I wasn’t talking about her.
17598,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen.  It’s always changing, who we’re supposed to love and who we’re not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want."
17599,ellaria sand,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.
17600,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Father. Aren’t you cold?
17601,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,No. What are you reading?
17602,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,The Dance of Dragons.
17603,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,What’s it about?
17604,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"It’s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered."
17605,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,“The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
17606,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,That’s just what they call it.
17607,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Doesn’t make much sense.
17608,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I think it’s poetic.
17609,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?"
17610,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I wouldn’t have chosen either. It’s all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
17611,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it."
17612,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"It’s alright, father."
17613,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You don’t even know what I’m talking about.
17614,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,It doesn’t matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?
17615,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Yes there is.
17616,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Good, I want to. I’m the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I’m your daughter."
17617,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Forgive me.
17618,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Where’s my father? I want to see my father.
17619,melisandre,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"It will all be over soon, Princess."
17620,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Where’s my father? No you can’t do this, father where are you?!"
17621,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!"
17622,selyse baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,It’s what the Lord wants. It’s a good thing. A great thing.
17623,melisandre,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way."
17624,selyse baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"If we don’t act then we’ll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice…"
17625,melisandre,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!"
17626,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!"
17627,selyse baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I can’t.
17628,stannis baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,There’s no other way. She has King’s blood.
17629,melisandre,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!"
17630,shireen baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Mother, don’t do this please! Please help! Don’t do this! Please, father! Mother, help!"
17631,selyse baratheon,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,No...
17632,daenerys targaryen,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Where have you been?
17633,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Just making sure everything’s in order.
17636,quick,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."
17638,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,They’re waiting for you. Clap your hands.
17639,daario naharis,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"That one, the smaller man, no question, that’s where you should put your money."
17640,tyrion lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,The smaller man it is.
17641,daenerys targaryen,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I’m not putting my money anywhere.
17642,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
17643,daario naharis,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. (looks at Hizdahr) He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.
17644,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not."
17645,daenerys targaryen,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?"
17646,daario naharis,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn’t get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here (he puts a dagger to his neck) or here (he puts the dagger to Hizdahr’s neck). And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren’t. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy."
17647,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You don’t approve?
17648,tyrion lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,There’s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
17649,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Fair enough, yet -- it’s an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?"
17650,tyrion lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,It’s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
17651,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,I’m not talking about myself. I’m talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.
17652,daenerys targaryen,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,That is greatness?
17653,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
17654,tyrion lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,My father would have liked you.
17656,daenerys targaryen,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
17657,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,At your command?
17658,daenerys targaryen,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,If need be.
17660,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,How many people will die to make this happen?
17661,daenerys targaryen,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
17662,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Those men think they’re dying for a good reason.
17663,daenerys targaryen,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Someone else’s reason.
17664,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don’t know their own minds, but you do."
17665,tyrion lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Well said, you’re an eloquent man. Doesn’t mean you’re wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles."
17667,jorah mormont,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen."
17668,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Your Grace--
17669,daario naharis,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Shut your mouth.
17670,tyrion lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You can end this.
17671,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,She cannot.
17672,tyrion lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,You can!
17673,daario naharis,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Protect your queen!
17674,hizdahr zo loraq,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way--"
17675,tyrion lannister,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Stay close!
17676,jorah mormont,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,This way!
17677,daario naharis,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,"The other side, follow me!"
17678,daario naharis,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Protect your queen!
17679,daenerys targaryen,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Drogon!
17680,daenerys targaryen,5,49,the dance of dragons,Unnamed Scene_69,Valahd..
17681,melisandre,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,"The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king. His fires have melted the snows away. The way ahead is clear."
17682,stannis baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,We ride for Winterfell.
17683,melisandre,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,And you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right.
17685,stannis baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,Prepare to form up.
17687,stannis baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,Tell me.
17689,stannis baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,How many?
17692,stannis baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,Speak up. It can’t be worse than mutiny.
17693,stannis baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,Cut her down.
17695,stannis baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.
17696,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,"He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world."
17697,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,So what are you gonna do?
17698,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,I’m gonna hope they don’t learn how to climb the wall.
17699,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,But… the Dragonglass?
17700,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,"No one’s ever getting that back, now. It wouldn’t have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it."
17701,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,But… you killed a White Walker.
17702,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…
17703,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,He’s made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
17704,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,Not enough. (pause) The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How’s it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black? (smiles)
17705,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn’t winning any elections back then.
17706,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,Here’s to us then. Long may they sneer.
17707,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,What?
17708,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,"I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That’s what I’m meant to be, not this."
17709,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,"I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who’s left to give me advice I trust?"
17710,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,"Well, there’s Edd."
17711,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,"I’ll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon’s gone. The Citadel has the world’s greatest library. I’ll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come."
17712,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,"If Gilly stays here then she’ll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I’ll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I’ll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. (pause) I’d rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that."
17713,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,Thank you.
17714,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,"You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too."
17715,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,They’ll bloody try.
17716,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,Sam?
17717,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,What?
17718,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,Sam…
17719,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,You’ve just been beaten half to death. How did you--
17720,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,Very carefully.
17721,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,I’m glad the end of the world’s working out for someone.
17722,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,I’ll come back.
17723,jon snow,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,To your return.
17724,sam,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,To my return.
17725,podrick payne,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,My lady! Stannis. Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.
17726,brienne of tarth,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,How do you know it’s Stannis?
17727,podrick payne,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,He’s carrying his flaming heart banners. From the Blackwater. I’ll never forget it.
17728,stannis baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,Trench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. And send out a foraging party immediately. The siege begins at sunrise.
17730,stannis baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,Bolton has women fighting for him.
17731,brienne of tarth,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,I do not fight for the Boltons. I’m Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?
17732,stannis baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,I did.
17733,brienne of tarth,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,"In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?"
17734,stannis baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,Unnamed Scene_70,"Go on, do your duty."
17735,ramsay bolton,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Looks like we’re done here.
17737,ramsay bolton,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,And I accept your surrender.
17738,ramsay bolton,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Let’s head back. My wife must be lonely.
17739,myranda,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,My lady. I have come to escort you back to your chamber.
17740,theon greyjoy,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Go with her. Please.
17741,sansa stark,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,"I know what Ramsay is. I know what he’ll do to me. (looks to Theon) If I’m going to die, let it happen while there’s some of me left."
17742,myranda,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,"Die? (lowers the bow) Who said anything about dying? You can’t die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn’t need all of you. Just the parts he’ll use to make his heir. Until you’ve given him a boy or two and he’s finished using them. (raises bow) He’s got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?"
17743,myranda,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,You’re leaving it to me? Good. Let’s begin.
17744,myranda,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Stop! Stop!
17746,theon greyjoy,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,He’s coming back.
17747,meryn trant,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,I can see I have my work cut out for me.You two. Out.
17748,arya stark,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,"You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I’ve gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I’m glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?"
17749,arya stark,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,I can’t hear you.
17750,arya stark,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,You know who I am. I’m Arya Stark.
17751,arya stark,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Do you know who you are?
17752,arya stark,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,You’re no one. You’re nothing.
17753,jaqen h'ghar,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,A girl has taken a life. The wrong life.
17754,waif,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,I was right about her.
17755,jaqen h'ghar,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,You were.
17756,waif,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,You’re not ready. Not at all.
17757,jaqen h'ghar,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,That man’s life wasn’t yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed.
17758,jaqen h'ghar,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Only death can pay for life.
17759,arya stark,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,"No! No! No, you don’t die! Don’t die! (sobs)"
17760,waif,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Why are you crying?
17761,arya stark,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,He was my friend.
17762,waif,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,No he wasn’t. Didn’t you listen to him?
17763,jaqen h'ghar,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,He was no one.
17764,arya stark,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,But if you’re… (looks to the Jaqen who drank the potion and is seemingly dead) Who’s this?
17765,jaqen h'ghar,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.
17766,jaqen h'ghar,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,The faces are for no one.
17767,jaqen h'ghar,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,You are still someone.
17768,jaqen h'ghar,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,And to someone…
17769,jaqen h'ghar,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,...the faces are as good as poison.
17770,arya stark,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,I can’t see!
17771,arya stark,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,What’s happening?! What’s happening?!
17772,doran martell,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,I wish you a safe journey home.
17773,jaime lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Thank you.
17774,ellaria sand,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Forgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world.
17775,bronn,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Maybe I’ll come visit you sometime.
17776,tyene sand,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Maybe I’ll come visit you.
17777,bronn,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Don’t wait too long. I’ve a noble woman to marry back home.
17778,tyene sand,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,"You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy. (bites his ear)"
17779,jaime lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,"Whenever you’re ready, My Lord."
17780,jaime lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Try not to lose it this time.
17781,myrcella baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,I’ll never take it off again.
17782,jaime lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,I know you didn’t want to leave Dorne. But I’m glad you’re coming home. Your mother’s desperate to see you. And I’m glad Trystane’s coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You’re lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.
17783,myrcella baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Do you think mother will like him.
17784,jaime lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,"If she sees you’re happy, I’m sure she will."
17785,myrcella baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,And you really believe that?
17786,jaime lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?
17787,myrcella baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,She likes you.
17788,jaime lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,"I’m not so sure about that. Listen. There’s something I’ve wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you’ve seen more of the world, you’ve learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you’ve fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? (Myrcella laughs) My point is… we don’t choose whom we love. We just… It’s beyond our control. I sound like an idiot."
17789,myrcella baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,No you don’t.
17790,jaime lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,What I’m trying to say. What I’m trying and failing to say…
17791,myrcella baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,I know what you’re trying to say.
17792,jaime lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,No. I’m afraid you don’t.
17793,myrcella baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,I do.
17794,myrcella baratheon,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,I know. About you and mother. I think a part of me always knew. And I’m glad. I’m glad that you’re my father.
17795,jaime lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Myrcella?
17796,jaime lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Myrcella?!
17797,jaime lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD_1,Myrcella?! Myrcella?!
17798,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"You love her, don’t you? How could you not. Of course, it’s hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman."
17799,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Does he always talk so much?
17800,grey worm,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Jorah the Andal.
17801,jorah mormont,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Torgo Nudho.
17802,grey worm,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,You should not be here.
17803,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"No, but he is."
17804,grey worm,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Our queen ordered him exiled from city.
17805,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Our queen would be dead if not for him.
17806,missandei,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,It’s true. And I would be dead if not for the… (look at Tyrion) little man.
17807,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Dwarf. I believe that’s the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.
17808,missandei,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,(Valyrian) A bit “rusty”.
17809,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,(Valyrian) “Rusty” (Common Tongue) Thank you.
17810,grey worm,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.
17811,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,You missed a good scrap.
17812,jorah mormont,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
17813,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"He’s right. The dragon headed north. If we’re going to find her, that’s where we’re to go."
17814,jorah mormont,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,We? You’re a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.
17815,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,And I intend to help her do it.
17816,jorah mormont,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,You’ve been here for how many days now? I’ve fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
17817,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,You betrayed her!
17818,jorah mormont,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Careful now.
17819,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"And she exiled you, twice, I believe?"
17820,jorah mormont,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,The second time thanks to you.
17821,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"Don’t blame me for your crimes, Mormont."
17822,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"(gestures to Tyrion) He’s right. The Queen exiled Jorah. (gestures to Jorah) And he’s right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we’ll know is if we ask her."
17823,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep."
17824,jorah mormont,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.
17825,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"Forgive me, but why would we bring you?"
17826,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Pardon me?
17827,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?
17828,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"Not precisely, but I have other skills that’d be very useful--"
17829,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Can you fight?
17830,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,I have fought. I don’t claim to be a great warrior.
17831,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Are you good on a horse?
17832,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Middling.
17833,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,So mainly you talk?
17834,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,And drink. I’ve survived so far.
17835,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. (to Missandei, Grey Worm, and Jorah) None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen."
17836,jorah mormont,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,He’s a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
17837,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,They wouldn’t. They will listen to Grey Worm.
17838,grey worm,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,I’ll come with you. I’ll find our queen.
17839,missandei,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
17840,grey worm,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,I am.
17841,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"He is, he’s the toughest man with no balls I’ve ever met. But you still can’t go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen."
17842,missandei,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"It’s true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half."
17843,daario naharis,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen’s closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. (to Tyrion) Try not to ruin her. (to Jorah) Looks like it’s you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let’s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about."
17845,varys,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
17846,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,I suppose there’s no point in asking how you found me.
17847,varys,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you’ve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons."
17848,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"Well, she didn’t execute me, so that’s a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I’m stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?"
17849,varys,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies’ strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
17850,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
17851,varys,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"If only. (beat) A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?"
17852,tyrion lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,I did miss you.
17853,varys,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"Oh, I know."
17854,daenerys targaryen,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,We have to go home.
17855,daenerys targaryen,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? (pause) We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?"
17856,daenerys targaryen,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,How far did you carry me? (surveys the area)
17857,daenerys targaryen,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"Drogon, we need to return. My people need me."
17858,daenerys targaryen,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"Well, there’s no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper."
17859,septa,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Confess. Confess.
17860,cersei lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--"
17861,high sparrow,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,You wish to make a confession?
17862,cersei lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"Once I’ve confessed, will I be free?"
17863,sparrow,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.
17864,cersei lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,"The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess."
17865,sparrow,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Name him.
17866,cersei lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Lancel Lannister.
17867,sparrow,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Your cousin. And the King’s squire.
17868,cersei lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,I was lonely and afraid.
17869,sparrow,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,You had a husband.
17870,cersei lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,A husband of whoring every chance he got.
17871,sparrow,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,His sins do not pardon your own.
17872,cersei lannister,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,May the gods forgive me.
17873,sparrow,5,50,mother's mercy,EXT. DORNE - DOCK_1,Other men?

17964,roose bolton,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1,"I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark. Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?"
17965,ramsay bolton,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1,No.
17966,roose bolton,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1,A reckoning will come. We need the North to face it. The entire North. They won’t back us without Sansa Stark. We no longer have Sansa Stark. You played your games with her. You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they’re both gone.
17967,ramsay bolton,6,51,the red woman,WINTERFELL - HALLWAY_1,I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds. They won’t get far.

18058,varys,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,Who wrote it?
18059,tyrion lannister,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,Hard to know. Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.
18060,varys,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,The Sons of the Harpy?
18061,tyrion lannister,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,"Very possibly. Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren’t even property to begin with. You can see why they’re unhappy. Of course, it could also be the freed men."
18063,red priest,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,"The Lord of Light sent the Mother of Dragons to you, and those who love the darkness chased her away."
18064,tyrion lannister,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.
18065,varys,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.

Or will you  you take up her flames yourselves? Will you fight for your own salvation, now that Queen Daenerys is not here to fight for you?"
18067,tyrion lannister,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,It’s a problem.
18068,tyrion lannister,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,"Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill. Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you. We can’t fight an enemy we don’t know."
18069,varys,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,"The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone."
18070,tyrion lannister,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,And have you started looking for that someone?
18071,varys,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,"My little birds have already taken wing. Soon they’ll return, singing songs of men in gold masks."

18078,daario naharis,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,Perhaps she’s tired of being queen. I don’t think she likes it very much.
18079,jorah mormont,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,She’s too smart to like it.

18088,daario naharis,6,51,the red woman,SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANE’S CHAMBER_1,If I grow old. I hope I do. I want to see what the world looks like when she’s done conquering it.

18255,cersei lannister,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7,Good. It was always her color.
18256,tommen baratheon,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7,"I’m sorry for keeping you here. I shouldn’t have, but I was -- I didn’t want to lose you again."
18257,cersei lannister,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7,I understand. I’m glad to see you.
18258,tommen baratheon,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7,I know I should have come sooner. I wanted to. I was wrong.
18259,cersei lannister,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7,It’s all right.
18260,tommen baratheon,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7,"No, it isn’t."
18261,tommen baratheon,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7,"I should have executed all of them. I should have pulled down the sept onto the High Sparrow’s head before I let them do that to you, as you would have for me. You raised me to be strong...and I wasn’t. But I want to be. Help me."
18262,cersei lannister,6,52,home,RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER_7,Always.
18263,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,"If I lost my cock, I’d drink all the time."
18264,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,"Meaning no offense. He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes."
18265,varys,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,I do not make dwarf jokes.
18266,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,You think them.
18267,varys,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,"So, the fleet. It’s been burned."
18268,grey worm,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,"We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything."
18269,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,Surely there’s some good news lurking somewhere.
18270,varys,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid.
18271,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,Perhaps they can tell us their secret.
18272,varys,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,"The Masters have retaken both cities. Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver’s Bay has returned to the slavers."
18273,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.
18274,missandei,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,They are not eating. They haven’t touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.
18275,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,"Daenerys is the dragon queen. Can’t very well let the dragons starve, that’s obvious."
18276,grey worm,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,"If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?"
18277,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,Dragons do not do well in captivity.
18278,missandei,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,How do you know this?
18279,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,That’s what I do. I drink and I know things.
18280,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,"The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles. Then Daenerys’s ancestors started chaining them up in pens. A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats. They must be unchained or they’ll waste away. Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?"
18281,missandei,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,Many times.
18282,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,And did they ever harm you?
18283,missandei,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,Never.
18284,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,Dragons are intelligent. More intelligent than men according to some maesters. They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies. I am their friend.
18285,varys,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,Do they know that?
18286,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS_1,They will. It’s time they had their supper.
18287,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,I’m friends with your mother. I’m here to help. Don’t eat the help.
18288,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day. I begged him for one of you. “It wouldn’t even have to be a big dragon,” I told him. “It could be little, like me.”"
18289,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard. Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago. I cried myself to sleep that night.
18290,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,But here you are.
18291,tyrion lannister,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face."
18292,waif,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,What’s your name?
18293,waif,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,What’s your name?
18294,arya stark,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,No one.
18295,waif,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,I don’t believe that.
18296,waif,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,You don’t believe that.
18297,jaqen h'ghar,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,Who are you?
18298,arya stark,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,No one.
18299,jaqen h'ghar,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"If a girl says her name, a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight."
18300,arya stark,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,A girl has no name.
18301,jaqen h'ghar,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"If a girl says her name, a man will feed her tonight."
18302,arya stark,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,A girl has no name.
18303,jaqen h'ghar,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"If a girl says her name, a man will give her eyes back."
18304,arya stark,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,A girl has no name.
18305,jaqen h'ghar,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,Come.
18306,jaqen h'ghar,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,Leave it. A girl is not a beggar anymore.
18307,rickard karstark,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,He came upon the bodies on our way here.
18308,roose bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?
18309,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,They obviously had help.
18310,roose bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"I didn’t think lady Sansa killed them all by herself. Thank you for this report, Lord Kastark."
18311,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,We know where she’s going. Her brother’s at Castle Black.
18312,rickard karstark,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,Ned Stark’s last surviving son?
18313,roose bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark."
18314,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"So was I, Father."
18315,rickard karstark,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,Your hold on the North will never be secure as long as a Stark can walk through that door.
18316,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"Castle Black isn’t defended on the southern side. And the few men left are barely men at all. Farm boys and thieves. With a small force we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow --"
18317,roose bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,Murder the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch? You’d unite every house in the North against us.
18318,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"We don’t need every house in the North. The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks. command more soldiers than all the other houses combined. With their support, none could challenge us."
18319,rickard karstark,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,The Starks lost my house the day King Rob cut off my father’s head. It’s time for new blood in the North.
18320,roose bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog, you’ll be treated as a mad dog. Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed."
18321,wolkan,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,My lords. Lady Walda has given birth. A boy. Red-cheeked and healthy.
18322,rickard karstark,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"My congratulations, Lord Bolton."
18323,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"Congratulations, Father. I look forward to meeting my new brother."
18324,roose bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,You’ll always be my firstborn.
18325,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,Thank you for saying that. It means a great deal to me.
18326,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"Maester Wolkan, send ravens to all the Northern houses. Roose Bolton is dead. Poisoned by our enemies."
18327,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,How did he die?
18328,wolkan,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,Poisoned by his enemies.
18329,rickard karstark,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,You're talking to your lord. Use respect.
18330,wolkan,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"Forgive me, my lord."
18331,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,Send for Lady Walda and the baby.
18332,wolkan,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"She’s resting, my lord."
18333,wolkan,6,52,home,MEEREEN - CATACOMBS_1,"At once, my lord."
18334,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,There he is.
18336,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,May I hold him?
18338,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,Little brother.
18340,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,"Of course. Follow me, Mother."
18342,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,Down!
18346,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,I am Lord Bolton.
18348,ramsay bolton,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,I prefer being an only child.
18349,brienne of tarth,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,"I saw her with a man. I don’t think he hurt her. She didn’t want to leave him, he didn’t want to leave her."
18350,sansa stark,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,You don’t know which way she went?
18351,brienne of tarth,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,I spent three days looking for her. She disappeared.
18352,sansa stark,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,How did she look?
18353,brienne of tarth,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,She looked good. She wasn’t exactly dressed like a lady.
18354,sansa stark,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,"No, she wouldn’t be."
18355,brienne of tarth,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,What happened at Winterfell?
18356,sansa stark,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,I should’ve gone with you while I had the chance.
18357,brienne of tarth,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,"It was a difficult choice, my lady."
18358,brienne of tarth,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,We’ve all had to make difficult choices.
18359,theon greyjoy,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,We shouldn’t be lighting fires. It’s not safe. He won’t stop hunting us.
18360,sansa stark,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,"We just have to make it to Castle Black. Once we’re with Jon, Ramsay won’t be able to touch us."
18361,theon greyjoy,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate.
18362,sansa stark,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,I won’t let him. I’ll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.
18363,theon greyjoy,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,"And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place? The truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded?"
18364,theon greyjoy,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,"And the truth about Rob, who I betrayed?"
18365,sansa stark,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,"When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven."
18366,theon greyjoy,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,I don’t want to be forgiven. I can never make amends to your family for all the things that I’ve done. They’ll keep you safer than I ever could.
18367,sansa stark,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,You’re not coming with us?
18368,theon greyjoy,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,I would have taken you all the way to the Wall. I would have died to get you there.
18369,theon greyjoy,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,May I take one of the horses?
18370,sansa stark,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,Where will you go?
18371,theon greyjoy,6,52,home,WINTERFELL - COMMONS_1,Home.
18372,yara greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.
18373,balon greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,And the Ironborn who held it?
18374,yara greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,They died fighting to a man.
18375,balon greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,What is dead may never die.
18376,yara greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,What is dead may never die.
18377,yara greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,But they did and our invasion died with them. Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.
18378,balon greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,They we will take more.
18379,yara greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,Why? For more pinecones and rocks?
18380,balon greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,Because I order it.
18381,yara greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,"We can defeat anyone at sea, but we’ll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies."
18382,balon greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,"Not if our captains defy my orders, abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish mission."
18383,yara greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,I won’t apologize for trying to rescue Theon.
18384,balon greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,Then where is he?
18385,yara greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,"Where is your kingdom? We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war. That war is over. The last time we provoked them too far, I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers. I lost two brothers that day."
18386,balon greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL_1,"And I lost three sons. The War of the Five Kings, they call it. Well, the other four are dead. When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you wan. But for now, shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will."
18387,balon greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1,"Let me pass. You fool, move aside for your king."
18388,hooded figure,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1,"Haven’t I always, brother?"
18389,balon greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1,I thought you’d be rotting under some foreign sea by now.
18390,euron greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1,What is dead may never die.
18391,euron greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1,Has the custom changed since I’ve been gone? Aren’t you supposed to repeat the words?
18392,balon greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1,You can mock our god without my help.
18393,euron greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1,"I don’t mock the Drowned God. I am the Drowned God. From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray."
18394,euron greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1,"You’re old, brother. You've had your time. Now let another rule."
18395,balon greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1,I heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea. They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.
18396,euron greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1,They did.
18397,balon greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1,"And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues."
18398,euron greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1,I needed silence.
18399,balon greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1,What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm?
18400,euron greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE_1,"I am the storm, brother. The first storm and the last. And you’re in my way."
18401,aeron greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,"Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves. Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh. Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children."
18403,yara greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,I’m going to find out who did this. I’m going to feed them to the sharks while they live. I swear it by the Salt Throne.
18404,aeron greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,"The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon, not unless the kingsmoot chooses you."
18405,yara greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,My father would’ve wanted me to rule.
18406,aeron greyjoy,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear. Perhaps you'll win. Perhaps you’ll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn. And perhaps not.INT. CASTLE BLACK - MELISANDRE’S CHAMBERMELISANDRE is sitting at the fireplace. Someone knocks on the door.
18407,melisandre,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,Come in.
18408,davos seaworth,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,"I'm sorry, my lady. I didn’t mean to interrupt."
18409,melisandre,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,You interrupt nothing.
18410,davos seaworth,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,I assume you know why I’m here.
18411,melisandre,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,I will after you tell me.
18412,davos seaworth,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,It’s about the Lord Commander.
18413,melisandre,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,The former Lord Commander.
18414,davos seaworth,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,Does he have to be?
18415,melisandre,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,What are you asking?
18416,davos seaworth,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,Do you know of any magic...that could help him? Bring him back?
18417,melisandre,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,"If you want to help him, leave him be."
18418,davos seaworth,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,Can it be done?
18419,melisandre,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,There are some with his power.
18420,davos seaworth,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,How?
18421,melisandre,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,I don’t know.
18422,davos seaworth,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,Have you seen it done?
18423,melisandre,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,"I met a man who came back from the dead, but the priest who did it -- It shouldn’t have been possible."
18424,davos seaworth,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,But it was. It could be now.
18425,melisandre,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,Not for me.
18426,davos seaworth,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,Not for you? I saw you drink poison that should’ve killed you. I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.
18427,melisandre,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,"Everything I believed, the great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie."
18428,melisandre,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,You were right all along. The Lord never spoke to me.
18429,davos seaworth,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,"Fuck him, then. Fuck all of them. I’m not a devout man, obviously. Seven Gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same."
18430,davos seaworth,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,I’m not asking the Lord of Light for help.I’m asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.
18431,melisandre,6,52,home,PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY_1,I never had this gift.

18435,davos seaworth,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_71,What do you remember?
18436,jon snow,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_71,They stabbed me. Olly...he put a knife in my heart. I shouldn’t be here.
18437,davos seaworth,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_71,The lady brought you back.
18438,melisandre,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_71,"Afterwards, after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go? What did you see?"
18439,jon snow,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_71,Nothing. There was nothing at all.
18440,melisandre,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_71,"The Lord let you come back for a reason. Stannis was not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be."
18441,davos seaworth,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_71,Could you give us a moment?
18442,davos seaworth,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_71,"You were dead. And now you’re not. That’s completely fucking mad, seems to me. I can only imagine how it seems to you."
18443,jon snow,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_71,I did what I thought was right. And I got murdered for it. And now I’m back. Why?
18444,davos seaworth,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_71,I don’t know. Maybe we’ll never know. What does it matter? You go on. You fight for as long as you can. You clean up as much of the shit as you can.
18445,jon snow,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_71,"I don’t know how to do that. I thought I did, but...I failed."
18446,davos seaworth,6,53,oathbreaker,Unnamed Scene_71,Good. Now go fail again.
18447,tormund,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_1,They think you’re some kind of god. The man who returned from the dead.
18448,jon snow,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_1,I’m not a god.
18449,tormund,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_1,I know that.
18450,tormund,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_1,I saw your pecker. What kind of god would have a pecker that small?
18451,dolorous edd,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_1,Your eyes are still brown. Is that still you in there?
18452,jon snow,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_1,I think so. Hold off on burning my body for now.
18453,dolorous edd,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_1,That’s funny. You sure that’s still you in there?
18454,gilly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,You all right?
18455,samwell tarly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,"Yes. Yes, I’m fine."
18456,gilly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?
18457,samwell tarly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,I don’t think so.
18458,gilly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,"Sea, see. They’re spelled different, but they sound the same."
18459,samwell tarly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,"Yeah, they do."
18460,gilly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,"It was before I learned how to read, obviously."
18461,gilly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,"Sam, are you going to be sick?"
18462,gilly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,Won’t be long. We’ll be in the south soon. I’m excited to see Oldtown. Captain says it’s the most beautiful city in Westeros. Are you going to vomit again?
18463,samwell tarly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,"No. No, no, no. The Citadel doesn’t admit women. There won’t be a place for you there or for Little Sam."
18464,gilly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,I stayed at Castle Black. There’s no women allowed there.
18465,samwell tarly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,The Citadel isn’t Castle Black. I don’t have a Jon Snow or a Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules.
18466,gilly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,"I’ll stay in Oldtown, then."
18467,samwell tarly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,By yourself? With a baby and no money?
18468,gilly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,"So if we’re not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?"
18469,samwell tarly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,"To my home. Horn Hill. My father’s -- well, my father, but my mother’s a kind woman and my sister’s lovely. They’ll take care of you both."
18470,gilly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,"“Wherever you go, I go, too.” That’s what you said."
18471,samwell tarly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,I said that because I want you and Little Same to be safe. That’s all I want -- to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you’ll be safe
18472,gilly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,Us and everyone else in the world.
18473,samwell tarly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,"I don’t care about them. Well, no, I do, but I don’t really. I care about you and him."
18474,gilly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,"I know that, Sam. And he does, too. You're the only one who ever has."
18475,gilly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,"If you think it’s for the best, we trust you."
18476,samwell tarly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,I’d feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off.
18477,gilly,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,I’d never do that to the father of my son.
18478,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,That’s my father.
18479,three-eyed raven,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,"The man beside him is Howland Reed, Meera’s father."
18480,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,Ser Arthur Dayne.
18481,three-eyed raven,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,The Sword of the Morning.
18482,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw.
18483,arthur,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,Lord Stark.
18484,eddard stark,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,I looked for you on the Trident.
18485,arthur,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,We weren’t there.
18487,eddard stark,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,The Mad King is dead. Rhaegar lies beneath the ground. Why weren’t you there to protect your prince?
18488,arthur,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,Our prince wanted us here.
18489,eddard stark,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,Where’s my sister?
18490,arthur,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
18491,arthur,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,And now it begins.
18492,eddard stark,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,No. Now it ends.
18493,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,He’s better than my father.
18494,three-eyed raven,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,Far better.
18495,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,But Father beat him.
18496,three-eyed raven,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,Did he?
18497,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,I know he did. Heard the story a thousand times.
18498,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,He stabbed him in the back.
18499,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,What’s in the tower?
18500,three-eyed raven,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,That’s enough for one day. We’ll visit again another time.
18501,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,I want to see where he’s going.
18502,three-eyed raven,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,Time to go.
18503,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,VESSEL - HOLD_1,Father!
18504,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,Why did you do that? Take me back there. I want to go back.
18505,three-eyed raven,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,No.
18506,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,He heard me.
18507,three-eyed raven,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,Maybe. Maybe he heard the wind.
18508,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,He heard me.
18509,three-eyed raven,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,The past is already written. The ink is dry.
18510,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,What’s in that tower? I want to go back there.
18511,three-eyed raven,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"I’ve told you many times, stay too long where you don’t belong and you will never return."
18512,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,Why do I want to return? So I can be a cripple again? So I can talk to an old man in a tree?
18513,three-eyed raven,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me?"
18514,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,So why did you?
18515,three-eyed raven,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,I was waiting for you.
18516,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,I don’t want to be you.
18517,three-eyed raven,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"I don’t blame you. You won’t be here forever. You won’t be an old man in a tree. But before you leave, you must learn."
18518,bran stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,Learn what?
18519,three-eyed raven,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,Everything.EXT. VAES DOTHRAK - DAYDAENERYS is entering Vaes Dothrak with the horde. A mounted Bloodrider ushers her onward with a nudge of his foot.
18520,bloodrider,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"Hey, Great Khaleesi. Move your ass."
18521,khal moro,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"Welcome home, Khaleesi."
18522,dothraki woman,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,Go.
18523,daenerys targaryen,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads!
18524,daenerys targaryen,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,You have made a mistake. One you will regret. I am the wife of the Great Khal.
18525,dothraki matron,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,We know who you are. I remember you eating the stallion’s heart. Why didn’t you come to us after Khal Drogo died?
18526,daenerys targaryen,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons. My place is not here with you."
18527,dothraki matron,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"You were the wife of the Great Khal. You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side. He didn’t. I was the wife of the Great Khal. Khal Savo. I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side. You’re young. We were all young once. But we all understand the way things are. You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us."
18528,daenerys targaryen,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.
18529,dothraki matron,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"Yes. Immediately after the death of their khal. But you went out into the world. That is forbidden. All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven. They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved. And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo’s silver-haired widow. With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons. It is the best you can hope for, now.INT. MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOMVARYS is sitting on the steps of the throne, fanning himself. Several Unsullied stand around the perimeters of the room."
18530,varys,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,I don’t know how you stand it in all that leather.
18531,varys,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,If we could have the room.
18532,varys,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"You look lovely today, my dear. You really do. How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat."
18534,varys,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,I am not a torturer.
18535,varys,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,Though it so often is what people deserve.
18536,varys,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"And it does provide answers. But they’re usually the wrong answers. My job is to find the right answers. Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy. I’d like to make you happy, Vala. That’s your name, isn’t it, Vala?"
18537,varys,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"That’s all right. I know who you are and what you’ve done. You’ve done a lot. You’ve sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do. And you’ve helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons."
18538,vala,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history.
18539,varys,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"I understand. Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective. I have a different perspective, of course. I think it’s important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours. Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy. That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I’m afraid I don’t really speak the language. Such a handsome boy. Those big, brown eyes. Good luck keeping the ladies away."
18540,vala,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"Yes, you’re a true liberator, aren’t you? You won’t torture me, you’ll just threaten my son."
18541,varys,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"Children are blameless. I have never hurt them. Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you. But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen’s soldiers. We both know the penalty for that crime. How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem."
18542,vala,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"If I tell you anything, they’ll kill me. So either you kill me or they do."
18543,varys,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,"Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem. There is a third option, though. A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos. I’ve already booked passage for a woman and her young son. I’ll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again."
18544,varys,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_3,Though I’m afraid we’ll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it. Far too heavy for me. The boat sails at dawn. You need to decide now. A new life for you and Dom or…
18545,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?"
18546,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,You speak 19 languages. You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.
18547,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"You two, you spend a great deal of time together. What would you be talking about if I weren’t here?"
18548,grey worm,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Patrol. When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied. What we see on patrol. Who we captured on patrol.
18549,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,That’s good. That’s very good.
18550,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,But that’s a report. I was thinking more of a conversation. A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms.
18551,missandei,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Who said this?
18552,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Me. Just now. All right, no conversations. Let’s play a game."
18553,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"You don’t play games, either one of you, ever?"
18554,grey worm,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Games are for children.
18555,missandei,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.
18556,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"There, that’s a start."
18557,missandei,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Only the girls.
18558,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Oh no, no, no. Not that, of course not that. Innocent games, fun games, drinking games."
18559,missandei,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,We do not drink.
18560,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Until you do.
18561,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Alright. No drinking. We can play without drinking. It’s a wonderful game. I invented it. Here’s how it works. I make a statement about your past. If I’m wrong, I drink. And if I’m right -- Maybe we can’t play without drinking."
18562,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Oh, you took your time."
18563,varys,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Sorry. I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy. Some things you can’t rush.
18564,missandei,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,You found out?
18565,varys,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,The good masters of Astapor. And the wise masters of Yunkai. With help from their friends in Volantis.
18566,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,You see? You don’t even have to worry about the local rebellion. We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it.
18567,grey worm,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once. We will do it again and execute the Masters.
18568,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?"
18569,grey worm,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?"
18570,missandei,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"We cannot. The Masters only speak one language. They spoke it to me for many years. I know it better than my mother tongue. If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them. May it be the last thing they ever hear."
18571,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,You may be right.
18572,grey worm,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,So we will fight them?
18573,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Possibly.
18574,missandei,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Possibly?
18575,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,It’s a conversation.
18576,tyrion lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis?"
18577,varys,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Of course. Man can be fickle, but birds always trust."
18578,qyburn,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Your eye looks much better, Arthur. How’s your mother’s jaw?"
18579,arthur,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Better.
18580,qyburn,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,And your father?
18581,arthur,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,No one’s seen him.
18582,qyburn,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,And no one will. That worked out rather nicely.
18584,qyburn,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,I don’t think so. Do you miss him?
18586,arthur,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,He called us his little birds. He gave us sweets.
18587,qyburn,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,It’s funny you should mention that. Guess what I happened to find today. Candied plums from Dorne.
18588,qyburn,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me. All I need in return are whispers."
18589,qyburn,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,No need to be afraid. This is Ser Gregor. He’s friends with all my friends.
18590,qyburn,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Run along now.
18591,cersei lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Varys's little birds?
18592,qyburn,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Your little birds now, your Grace."
18593,jaime lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,What did you do to him exactly? I haven't been able to get a clear answer.
18594,qyburn,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Oh, a number of things."
18595,jaime lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Does he understand what we’re saying? I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place."
18596,qyburn,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,He understands well enough.
18597,jaime lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow’s head like a melon.
18598,cersei lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him. Ser Gregor will can’t face them all. And he won’t have to. He’ll only have to face one.
18599,jaime lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?
18600,cersei lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Not yet.
18601,jaime lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.
18602,cersei lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Don’t stop at the city. I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North. If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it. If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear. I want to know who they are. I want to where they are."
18603,pycelle,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was, Qyburn is worse. I told them all. I told them. He’s arrogant, dangerous. You don’t get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason. And no one listened to my advice, so here we are."
18604,pycelle,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination. We never sanctioned this, this experiment. And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest --"
18605,kevan lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Can I help you?
18606,cersei lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Why are you here?
18607,mace tyrell,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,My mother...
18608,olenna tyrell,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"I was invited, my dear, o help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen’s imprisonment."
18609,cersei lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Thank you for bringing it up. It’s well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.
18610,olenna tyrell,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Margaery is the queen. You are not the queen because you’re not married to the king. I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family.
18611,kevan lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,This is a Small Council meeting. You have no position on the Small Council.
18612,jaime lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,I’m Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council.
18613,cersei lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?"
18614,pycelle,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Well, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King’s council. Of course, that was the Mad King. King Robert saw things differently."
18615,cersei lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"What about Myrcella’s death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?"
18616,jaime lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne. We've got a lot to discuss. All of us together.
18617,cersei lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it."
18618,kevan lannister,6,53,oathbreaker,RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"No, we cannot make you leave. And you cannot make us stay. Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all."
18619,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,"Oh, your Grace."
18620,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,My mother would like to see her daughter’s final resting place.
18621,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,"Oh, I'm, sorry, your Grace. That’s not possible. Not yet."
18622,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,When will it be possible?
18623,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,When she's fully atoned for her sins.
18624,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,You’ve cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city. That wasn’t a full atonement?
18625,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,"No. She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins."
18626,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,I want you to let her see Myrcella’s resting place.
18627,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,I am the king.
18628,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,You are.
18629,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,And what does that mean to you?
18630,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,It means a great deal to me. The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world. Do you know who told me that? Your mother.
18631,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you’ve put her through?
18632,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,"How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother’s presence? It was through their own mothers. There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that. But when she speaks of you, the Mother’s love outshines it all. Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world. Because it doesn’t come from this world. But you know that. You’ve felt it. You’ve seen her when she talks to you."
18633,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Yes.
18634,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,It’s a great gift. One I never had. Envy. One more thing for me to atone for.
18635,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,"You Grace, may I? Do you mind? It's my knees."
18636,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Of course.
18637,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,"When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you."
18638,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,I still don’t understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured.
18639,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,It’s not what I want. It’s what the gods want. They make their will known to us and it’s up to us to either accept or reject it.
18640,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Please.
18641,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,"If we’re to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings. A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can. And no one is wiser than the gods."
18642,tommen baratheon,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,My grandfather once said something similar. Except for the part about the gods.
18643,high sparrow,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not. As they work through your mother. There’s so much good in all of us. The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.
18644,waif,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Who are you?
18645,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,No one.
18646,waif,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Who were you before you came here?
18647,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Arya Stark.
18648,waif,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Tell me about Arya Stark’s family.
18649,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,"Her father was Eddard Stark. Her mother was Catelyn Stark. She had one sister, Sansa, and four brothers."
18650,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Three brothers.
18651,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,"Rob, Bran, Rickon. And a half-brother, Jon."
18652,waif,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,And where are they now?
18653,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,They may be dead for all a girl knows.
18654,waif,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Tell me about The Hound.
18655,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Also dead.
18656,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Arya Stark left him to die. He was on her list.
18657,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,He was not on her list anymore. She’d taken him off it.
18658,waif,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Why? Didn’t she want him dead any longer?
18659,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,She did and she did not.
18660,waif,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,She sounds confused.
18661,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,"Yes, she was."
18662,waif,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Who else was on Arya Stark’s funny little list?
18663,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,"Cersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Walder Frey."
18664,waif,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,That’s a short list. That can’t be everyone you want to kill.
18665,waif,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Are you sure you’re not forgetting someone?
18666,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_1,Which name would you like a girl to speak?
18667,jaqen h'ghar,6,53,oathbreaker,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER_1,"If a girl tells me her name, I will give her eyes back."
18668,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER_1,A girl has no name.
18669,jaqen h'ghar,6,53,oathbreaker,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER_1,Come.
18670,jaqen h'ghar,6,53,oathbreaker,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER_1,"If a girl is truly no one, she has nothing to fear."
18671,jaqen h'ghar,6,53,oathbreaker,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER_1,Who are you?
18672,arya stark,6,53,oathbreaker,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER_1,No one.
18673,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,The Umbers are a famously loyal house.
18674,rickard karstark,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Famously loyal to the Starks.
18675,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,"And you, Lord Karstark? Your people share blood with the Starks, don’t they?  But here we are. Times change."
18676,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,"When my father became Warden of the North, your house refused to pledge their banners."
18677,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Your father was a cunt.
18678,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,"My beloved father, the Warden --"
18679,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,"Your father was a cunt and that’s why you killed him.  I might’ve done the same to my father, if he hadn’t have done me the favor of dying on his own."
18680,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,My father was poisoned by our enemies.
18681,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Mmm.
18682,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,"Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?"
18683,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,"The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.  We’re farther north than any of you fuckers. Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first.  I like fighting wildlings, been doing it all my life.  But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone."
18684,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,So now you’ve come seeking help?
18685,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,"We need to help each other.  The colder it gets, the farther South those goat fuckers will roam. Won't take them long to get here."
18686,rickard karstark,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?
18687,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,"If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe.  He knows this place better than we ever will."
18688,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Pledge your banners to House Bolton.  Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends.
18689,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,I’m not kissing your fucking hand.
18690,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord.
18691,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,I’m not doing that either.
18692,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Why would I trust a man who won’t honor tradition?
18693,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Your father honored tradition. Knelt for Robb Stark. Called him King of the North. Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?
18694,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.
18695,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths. I've got a gift for you.
18696,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,"A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads."
18697,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,"A girl, aye.  A wild one."
18698,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,I like them wild.
18699,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,"And the boy, nice and young. The way Karstark likes them."
18700,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Who’s this?
18701,smalljon umber,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,Rickon Stark.
18702,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,How do I know that’s Rickon Stark?
18703,ramsay bolton,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,"Welcome home, Lord Stark."
18704,dolorous edd,6,53,oathbreaker,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_1,It’s time.
18705,jon snow,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1,"If you have any last words, now is the time."
18706,bowen marsh,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1,You shouldn’t be alive. It’s not right.
18707,jon snow,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1,Neither was killing me.
18708,othell yarwyck,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1,My mother's still living at White Harbor. Could you write her? Tell her I died fighting the wildings.
18709,alliser thorne,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1,"I had a choice, Lord Commander. Betray you or betray the Night’s Watch. You brought an army of wildlings into our lands. An army of muderers and raiders. If I had to do it all over knowing where I’d end up, I pray I’d make the right choice again."
18710,jon snow,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1,"I’m sure you would, Ser Alliser."
18711,alliser thorne,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1,"I fought, I lost. Now I rest. But you, Lord Snow, you’ll be fighting their battles forever."
18712,dolorous edd,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1,We should burn the bodies.
18713,jon snow,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1,You should.
18714,dolorous edd,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1,What do you want me to do with this?
18715,jon snow,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1,Wear it. Burn it. Whatever you want. You have Castle Black.
18716,jon snow,6,53,oathbreaker,CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD_1,My watch is ended.
18717,dolorous edd,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_72,Where you gonna go?
18718,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_72,South.
18719,dolorous edd,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_72,What are you gonna do?
18720,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_72,Get warm.
18721,dolorous edd,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_72,I was with you at Hardhome. We saw what’s out there. We know it’s coming here. How can you leave us now?
18722,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_72,I did everything I could. You know that.
18723,dolorous edd,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_72,You swore a vow.
18724,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_72,"Aye, I pledged my life to the Night’s Watch. I gave my life."
18725,dolorous edd,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_72,For all nights to come.
18726,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,Unnamed Scene_72,"They killed me, Edd! My own brothers. You want me to stay here after that?"
18729,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,This is good soup. Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?
18730,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,With the peas and onions?
18731,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,Mmm.
18732,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,We never should have left Winterfell.
18733,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,"Don’t you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself, “Don’t go, you idiot.”"
18734,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,How could we know?
18735,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you. I wish I could change everything.
18736,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,We were children.
18737,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,"I was awful, just admit it."
18738,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,You were occasionally awful. I’m sure I can’t have been great fun. Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.
18739,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,Can you forgive me?
18740,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,There’s nothing to forgive.
18741,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,Forgive me.
18742,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,"All right. All right, I forgive you."
18743,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,"You’d think after thousands of years, the Night’s Watch would have learned how to make a good ale."
18744,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,Where will you go?
18745,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,"Where will we go? If I don’t watch over you, Father’s ghost will come back and murder me."
18746,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,Where will we go?
18747,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,"I can’t stay here, not after what happened."
18748,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,There’s only one place we can go. Home.
18749,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?
18750,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,We’ll take it back from them.
18751,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,I don’t have an army.
18752,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,How many wildlings did you save?
18753,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,They didn’t come here to serve me.
18754,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,They owe you their lives.
18755,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,You think they’ll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?
18756,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,Sansa.
18757,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,"Winterfell is our home. It’s ours and Arya’s and Bran’s and Rickon’s. Wherever they are, it belongs to our family. We have to fight for it."
18758,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,I’m tired of fighting.
18759,jon snow,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,It’s all I’ve done since I left home. I’ve killed brothers of the Night’s Watch. I’ve killed wildlings. I’ve killed men that I admire. I hanged a boy younger than Bran. I fought and I lost.
18760,sansa stark,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM_1,"If we don’t take back the North, we’ll never be safe. I want you to help me. But I’ll do it myself if I have to."

18769,melisandre,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,There was a battle. Stannis was defeated.

18771,brienne of tarth,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,I saw what happened. I saw Stannis’ forces defeated in the field.
18772,davos seaworth,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"My lady, I’m Ser Davos Seaworth."
18773,brienne of tarth,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,We’ve met before. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic.
18774,davos seaworth,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,That’s in the past now.
18775,brienne of tarth,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"Yes, it’s in the past. It doesn’t mean I forget. Or forgive. He admitted it, you know."
18776,davos seaworth,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,Who did?
18777,brienne of tarth,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,Stannis. Just before I executed him.
18778,petyr baelish,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,The Defender of the Vale!
18779,robin arryn,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,Uncle Petyr!
18780,petyr baelish,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,My lord. Come and see.
18781,petyr baelish,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,I missed your name day. Go on.
18782,robin arryn,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,A falcon!
18783,petyr baelish,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,A gyrfalcon. The greatest and rarest of birds.
18784,yohn royce,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"Last time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers."
18785,petyr baelish,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,Indeed I was.
18786,yohn royce,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"And yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell."
18787,petyr baelish,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men. Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting."
18788,yohn royce,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,Do you take me for a fool?
18789,petyr baelish,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else."
18790,yohn royce,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"Slander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him."
18791,petyr baelish,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,Your home is the Vale. The Lord of the Vale stands before us. And only his judgment concerns me.
18792,robin arryn,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?
18793,yohn royce,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"My lord. My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn. To your father, to your mother, and now to you."
18794,robin arryn,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?"
18795,petyr baelish,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"Lord Royce has served the Vale well. He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career. If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come."
18796,yohn royce,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord."
18797,petyr baelish,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,I think he deserves one more chance. What do you say?
18798,robin arryn,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,Fine.
18799,petyr baelish,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"I bring good news. My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell. I expect she’s headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander. But she won’t be safe there, not with the Boltons after her."
18800,robin arryn,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,She’s my cousin. We should help her.
18801,petyr baelish,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,That was my instinct as well.
18802,petyr baelish,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"Our lord has spoken. Gather the Knights of the Vale. The time has come to join the fray.EXT. MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE - DAYA ship is entering the harbor. TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are standing on the shore watching its approach."
18803,grey worm,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,You invite the enemy into our city?
18804,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"I did. As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”"
18805,grey worm,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,I don’t make peace with the queen’s enemies. I kill the queen’s enemies.
18806,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,"Yes, that’s the military approach. And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach."
18807,missandei,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her.
18808,missandei,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,How many days were you a slave?
18809,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,Long enough to know.
18810,missandei,6,54,book of the stranger,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_1,Not long enough to understand.
18811,yezzan zo qaggaz,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor. And somehow you’ve risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen. It’s most impressive.
18812,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.Here’s to reversals of fortune.
18813,razdal mo eraz,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,We came here to meet the queen and instead we’re greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.
18814,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Let’s make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want."
18815,belicho paenymion,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,We want you to leave Slaver’s Bay. Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go.
18816,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Queen Daenerys won’t stay in Meereen forever. Her path takes her westward.
18817,razdal mo eraz,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs. She refused them."
18818,missandei,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains."
18819,razdal mo eraz,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,As they have since the dawn of time.
18820,grey worm,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Not anymore.
18821,yezzan zo qaggaz,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,You think you’re a free man now? You still follow orders. Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn’t mean she’s not a master.
18822,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Friends, friends, friends, please."
18823,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing. That is the way of the world. I’m not here to change the way of the world.
18824,yezzan zo qaggaz,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Slavery is the way of our world.
18825,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,You don’t need slaves to make money. There haven’t been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you. But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it. So here is the queen’s proposal. Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver’s Bay time to adjust to the new order.
18826,yezzan zo qaggaz,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,What does that mean?
18827,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice."
18828,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices. In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy."
18829,yezzan zo qaggaz,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.
18830,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same. I do hope you accept, my friends. You will not receive a better offer."
18831,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it. And as a parting gift to our honored guests…
18832,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Give freedom a chance. See if it doesn’t taste every bit as good as what came before.
18833,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time.
18834,missandei,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,Perhaps I should translate for you.
18836,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,Excellent.
18838,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,I did.
18840,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.
18841,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,But I am not your ruler. I’m not the Breaker of Chains. I’m not the Unburnt. And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.
18843,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,Because our queen chose me as her advisor. Until she returns from her travels --
18845,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,Soon. You have my word.
18847,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations. As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace."
18849,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,We offered terms.
18851,grey worm,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"I am a soldier, not a politician. But if there is a chance for peace -- a just peace -- we should take it."
18853,missandei,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,I do not trust them. I will never trust them.
18854,missandei,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"But as a wise man once said, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”"
18855,grey worm,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,Do not use me for your lies.
18856,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,Those men respect you.
18857,grey worm,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,They respect me because they know who I am. They know I am loyal.
18858,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,As do I.
18859,grey worm,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,"I am loyal to my queen, not you. If you betray her work, you are my enemy."
18860,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.
18861,missandei,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,You promised the slavers they could keep slavery.
18862,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,For a short time.
18863,missandei,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,Seven years is not a short time for a slave.
18864,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,You’re right. Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once. War is a horror that should be ended at once. I can’t do both today.
18865,grey worm,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,You are wrong to trust these men.
18866,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,I don’t trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest. They’re trustworthy if they’re convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.
18867,grey worm,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,You don’t know them. You don’t understand them. We are not human in their eyes. They look at me and see a weapon. They look at her and see a whore.
18868,tyrion lannister,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast. Their contempt is their weakness. They’ll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.
18869,grey worm,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,You will not use them. They will use you. That is what they do.
18870,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,You all right? Why don’t you sit and catch your breath?
18871,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,I’m fine.
18872,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,"I don’t think you could ride the dragon. 20 years ago, maybe."
18873,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,What?
18874,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,"Our queen. She’s wild, you know. Don’t let her size fool you. It’s hard enough for me and I’m a young man. You, I don’t think your heart could take it."
18875,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,Must make you angry that our queen chose me.
18876,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,Makes me sad. You’ll disappoint her before long. She’ll move on.
18877,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,We’ll all disappoint her before long.
18878,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,We need each other right now. After we’re done needing each other --
18879,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,"Oh, I don’t want to fight you, Jorah the Andal. What do I have to gain? If I win, I’m the shit who killed an old man. If I lose, I’m the shit who was killed by an old man."
18880,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,"You didn’t get much discipline as a child, did you?"
18881,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,None.
18882,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,"The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway."
18883,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,"Eastern Market, Western Market. When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals. That’s where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen."
18884,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,What are you doing?
18885,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,It’s forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.
18886,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,Isn’t it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?
18887,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,"If they spot us and we’re unarmed, we’ll say we’re traders heading for the Western Market. But if they see weapons…"
18888,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,You’re asking a dog to hand over his teeth.
18889,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,"There’s 100,000 of them down there. We can’t fight our way out. We wait till dark, and then we’ll find her."
18890,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,Uh…
18891,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,I’m very attached to this knife.
18892,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,Don’t worry. it didn’t touch you.
18893,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,You know what happens?
18894,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,I know what happens.
18895,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE_1,I’ll do it myself.
18896,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1,I should have been born a Dothraki.
18897,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1,Come on.
18898,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1,My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost. Could you show us the way back?
18900,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1,"Wine. Come down to my stall tomorrow, I’ll give you a cask of the Arbor’s finest."
18903,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1,"Told you, I’m very attached to this knife."
18904,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1,You all right?
18905,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1,"If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us."
18906,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT_1,Huh.
18912,daenerys targaryen,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,That is more than most have.
18914,daenerys targaryen,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,I need to make water.
18916,daenerys targaryen,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,I will never run from Dothraki.
18918,daenerys targaryen,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,I needed fresh air. The old women stink.
18920,daenerys targaryen,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,You must have been very young when your Khal died.
18922,daenerys targaryen,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,Too bad he didn’t die sooner.
18925,daenerys targaryen,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,Mm-hmm.
18927,daenerys targaryen,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,They do. Would you like to see them one day?
18929,daenerys targaryen,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,"No, don’t hurt her."
18930,daario naharis,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,She’ll give us away.
18931,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,We have to go now.
18932,daenerys targaryen,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive.
18933,jorah mormont,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,All we can do is try.
18934,daenerys targaryen,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,No. We can do more than that. And you’re going to help me.
18935,daenerys targaryen,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,"And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi. Do not betray me."
18936,high sparrow,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,"If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go? What would you seek out?"
18937,margaery tyrell,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,"I’d go to my brother, my husband, my family."
18938,high sparrow,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,"Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power. Seeking out your family means seeking out sin. I’m not maligning you. I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else. My father was a cobbler. He died with I was young and I took over his shop. He was a simple man and he made simple shoes. But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them. Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time. Time most of all. Dozens of hours spent on a single pair."
18939,margaery tyrell,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,Quality takes time.
18940,high sparrow,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,"Yes. I imagine you’ve worn a year of someone’s life on your back. The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege. I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself. Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better."
18941,margaery tyrell,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,"And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness. Book of the Stranger, verse 25."
18942,high sparrow,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,You know The Seven-Pointed Star.
18943,margaery tyrell,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.
18944,high sparrow,6,54,book of the stranger,VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN_1,"Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people. You’re close. But it wasn’t a graveyard. It was a feast. I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all. We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor. I woke before dawn. I could barely stand. Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes. The truth of their bodies laid bare. I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn. And I saw it with perfect clarity. I saw what my sins were. The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position. It was all part of a story. A story I was telling myself about who I was. A collection of lies that would disappear in the light. The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was."

19109,petyr baelish,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,I didn’t know.
19110,sansa stark,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,I thought you knew everyone’s secrets.
19111,petyr baelish,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,"I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger."
19112,sansa stark,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,"The other things he did, ladies aren’t supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I don’t mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now."
19113,petyr baelish,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,I’m so sorry.
19114,sansa stark,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,You said you would protect me.
19115,petyr baelish,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
19116,sansa stark,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,I don’t believe you anymore. I don’t need you anymore. You can’t protect me. You won’t even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn’t I?
19117,petyr baelish,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,"Do you want me to beg for my life? If that’s what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do."
19118,sansa stark,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,What if I want you to die here and now?
19119,petyr baelish,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,Then I will die.
19120,sansa stark,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.
19121,petyr baelish,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,I would do anything to undo what’s been done to you. I know that I can’t. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.
19122,sansa stark,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,I have an army.

19128,jaqen h'ghar,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies. They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.

19130,jaqen h'ghar,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,"He was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled."
19131,arya stark,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,Where did they go?
19132,jaqen h'ghar,6,55,the door,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK_1,"Here. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires."

19147,lady crane,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1,Will you stay on as Joffrey’s Hand?
19148,camello,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1,The Iron Throne’s what I demand.
19149,lady crane,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1,You cannot.
19150,camello,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1,I can.

19158,camello,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1,What’s that mean?

19160,camello,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1,What’s that mean?

19162,camello,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1,But we had a deal all done and dusted.
19163,camello,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1,I’m starting to think you can’t be trusted.

19170,bobono,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1,"Worry not! All is well. I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister, the richest man you’ll see. He proclaims me Hand of the King. The position’s mine for life. And he’s give me permission to take Sansa as my wife."
19171,bobono,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1,You’ll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite.
19172,bobono,6,55,the door,BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE_1,"So let’s forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night."
19173,clarenzo,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1,It’s a wart. Two warts. I’ve got two fucking warts on my cock.

19177,bianca,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1,I had two lines.
19178,izembaro,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1,There are no small parts. You rang very false.
19179,bianca,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1,I rang very false?
19180,bobono,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1,"What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true."
19181,bianca,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1,You weren’t complaining about me last night.
19182,bobono,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1,"May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?"
19183,lady crane,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1,"I’m a rum girl, Bobono. You need to know that if we’re going to be intimate."
19184,bobono,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1,Of course we’re going to be intimate.
19185,lady crane,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1,It’s only a matter of time.
19186,lady crane,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1,To our children.
19187,bobono,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1,May they have your talent.
19188,lady crane,6,55,the door,BACKSTAGE_1,And your filthy mind.
19189,arya stark,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1,A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.

19193,jaqen h'ghar,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1,So a man has heard.
19194,arya stark,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1,Seems like a decent woman.
19195,jaqen h'ghar,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1,Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
19196,arya stark,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1,No. Who wants her dead?
19197,jaqen h'ghar,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1,That does not matter. The price was paid.
19198,arya stark,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1,The younger actress. She’s jealous because Lady Crane is better.
19199,jaqen h'ghar,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1,A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.
19200,arya stark,6,55,the door,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM_1,A girl has decided.

19233,euron greyjoy,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_75,Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn’t keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.

19235,yara greyjoy,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_75,"When did you return, Uncle?"
19236,euron greyjoy,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_75,A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.

19238,euron greyjoy,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_75,I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren’t for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn’t win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
19239,theon greyjoy,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_75,"That would have been hard to do. You weren’t here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time."
19240,euron greyjoy,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_75,Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?

19245,euron greyjoy,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_75,"Right idea, except I’m the one who’s going to build the Iron Fleet because I’m the one who knows how to use it. I’ve been all over the world. I’ve seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I’m going to build that fleet and I’m going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock."
19246,euron greyjoy,6,55,the door,Unnamed Scene_77,I’m not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we’re going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn’t born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.

19259,daenerys targaryen,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1,Is there a cure?
19260,jorah mormont,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1,I don’t know.
19261,daenerys targaryen,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1,How long does it take?
19262,jorah mormont,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1,I don’t know that either. But I’ve seen what happens when it goes far enough. I’ll end things before that.
19263,daenerys targaryen,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1,I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
19264,jorah mormont,6,55,the door,PYKE - BEACH_1,"Don’t be. All I’ve ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I’ll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi."

19272,varys,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1,So it’s safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.

19277,tyrion lannister,6,55,the door,VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE_1,"It’s not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story.

19288,kinvara,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
19289,tyrion lannister,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,Yes.
19290,kinvara,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
19291,tyrion lannister,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,She did indeed.
19292,kinvara,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,"Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven’t you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away."
19293,tyrion lannister,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,Ideally we’d avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
19294,kinvara,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,"You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she’s gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed."
19295,tyrion lannister,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,I’d settle for obeyed.
19296,kinvara,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
19297,tyrion lannister,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,That sounds most excellent --
19298,varys,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,"A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King’s Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he’d been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good."
19299,tyrion lannister,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,We’d be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
19300,varys,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,I suppose it’s hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn’t that the whole point of being a fanatic? You’re always right. Everything is the Lord’s will.
19301,kinvara,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,Everything is the Lord’s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
19302,varys,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,"And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?"
19303,tyrion lannister,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,"My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen."
19304,kinvara,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,"Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn’t be here helping the Lord’s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there’s still so much you don’t know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?"
19305,kinvara,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
19306,kinvara,6,55,the door,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER_3,"We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me."
19307,bran stark,6,55,the door,VISION OF THE PAST - UNKNOWN LAND_3,What?

19311,three-eyed raven,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,He touched you.
19312,three-eyed raven,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,He knows you are here. He’ll come for you.
19313,bran stark,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,But he can’t get in.
19314,three-eyed raven,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"He can now. His mark is on you. You must leave, all of you."
19315,meera reed,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge."
19316,hodor,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,Hodor.
19317,bran stark,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.
19318,three-eyed raven,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,The time has come.
19319,bran stark,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,The time for what?
19320,three-eyed raven,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,For you to become me.
19321,bran stark,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,But am I ready?
19322,three-eyed raven,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,No.
19323,jon snow,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men."
19324,davos seaworth,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys."
19325,davos seaworth,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we’re not doing so well there."
19326,sansa stark,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.
19327,davos seaworth,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don’t think we can count on them either."
19328,sansa stark,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?"
19329,davos seaworth,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"Precious little, my lady."
19330,sansa stark,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders."
19331,davos seaworth,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They’re more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don’t want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon’s going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it’s a fight they can win."
19332,jon snow,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build."
19333,sansa stark,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay’s own door."
19334,davos seaworth,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,I don’t doubt it. But Jon doesn’t have the Stark name.
19335,sansa stark,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"No, but I do."
19336,sansa stark,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark’s son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton’s. Ant there are also the Tullys. They’re not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question."
19337,davos seaworth,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,I didn’t know the Tullys still had an army.
19338,sansa stark,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
19339,jon snow,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,How do you know that?
19340,sansa stark,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
19341,davos seaworth,6,55,the door,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE_7,"That’s good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side."

19343,sansa stark,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3,You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.
19344,brienne of tarth,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3,We can send the Blackfish a raven.
19345,sansa stark,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3,Can’t risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.
19346,sansa stark,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3,Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you’ll know how to talk to him.
19347,sansa stark,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3,What is it?
19348,brienne of tarth,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3,I don’t like leaving you here alone.
19349,sansa stark,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3,With Jon?
19350,brienne of tarth,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3,"Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that’s understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --"
19351,sansa stark,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3,"Jon isn’t Tormund. Jon isn’t Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He’s my brother. He’ll keep me safe. I trust him."
19352,brienne of tarth,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY_3,Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
19353,jon snow,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_5,New dress?
19354,sansa stark,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_5,I made it myself. Do you like it?

19356,sansa stark,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_5,"Good, because I made this for you."
19357,sansa stark,6,55,the door,CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD_5,I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.

19416,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_78,"Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer’s over, you’ll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you’ll find more green here than anywhere else."
19417,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_78,You’re nervous. You’re a nervous talker.
19418,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_78,That’s not any better being a nervous mute.
19419,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_78,"I didn’t think I’d ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn’t. A person just doesn’t feel welcome at that point."
19420,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_78,And I certainly didn’t expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
19421,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_78,That Little Sam is your baby.
19422,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_78,"Yes, now that’s very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he’ll take you in. He’ll get an education. He’ll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?"
19423,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_80,I told them I met you in the North.
19424,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_80,Did you tell them how far north?
19425,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_80,"Well, it wasn’t a very large piece of parchment."
19426,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_80,You didn’t tell them where I’m really from? You didn’t tell them I’m a wildling?
19427,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,Unnamed Scene_80,"The thing is...my father doesn’t like wildlings. He hoped I’d make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it’s probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible."

19449,tommen baratheon,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1,Of course I’m afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
19450,high sparrow,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1,She’ll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn’t your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She’s truly opened her heart to them.
19451,tommen baratheon,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1,She’s always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
19452,high sparrow,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - COURTYARD_1,And now she’s devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?

19458,margaery tyrell,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,"Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?"
19459,tommen baratheon,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,"Yes, a few times. Have you?"
19460,margaery tyrell,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,"Yes, I have. He’s not quite what we thought he was, is he?"
19461,margaery tyrell,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,You think I’m mad. I sound mad.
19462,tommen baratheon,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,"No. No, you don’t. You- - you could never. You’re right, he’s not. He’s a lot more- -"
19463,margaery tyrell,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,He is. There’s something about him. His way of looking at the world. It’s not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It’s taken me a while. He’s helped me.
19464,tommen baratheon,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,What are you talking about? You’re a good person. You’ve always been a good person. You’re the best person I know.
19465,tommen baratheon,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
19466,margaery tyrell,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,"Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I’ve had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories."
19467,tommen baratheon,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,I don’t understand.
19468,margaery tyrell,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,It’s all right. It really is. It’s such a relief to let go of those lies.
19469,tommen baratheon,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,What about Loras?
19470,margaery tyrell,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,"I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don’t erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all.INT. HORN HILL - HALLWAYSAM paces. GILLY enters on the far end of the hall. She is wearing a dress and her hair is done up."
19471,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,It’s hard to walk in this.
19472,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM_3,It’s beautiful. You’re beautiful.
19473,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,"This venison, it’s very tasty. Is it from today’s hunt?"
19474,dickon tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,"Well, no. We haven’t been able to cure that one yet. This is last week’s."
19475,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,"Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey."
19476,dickon tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.
19477,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,"Oh, that’s a fair distance."
19478,dickon tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,So do you do much hunting up at the wall?
19479,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,"Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don’t hunt, you don’t eat."
19480,dickon tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
19481,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,"Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it’s my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She’s- - she’s quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress."
19482,melessa tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,"I imagine it’s common where you’re from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn’t it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt."
19483,talla tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
19484,randyll tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,That’s enough of that.
19485,melessa tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,"Samwell, would you care for more bread?"
19486,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,"Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother."
19487,randyll tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,Not fat enough already?
19488,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -
19489,randyll tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,I read your letter. You’re to be a maester.
19490,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,"Yes. And once I have my chain, I’ll return to Castle Black."
19491,randyll tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,I thought the Night’s Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.
19492,randyll tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I’ll wager you still can’t sit a horse or wield a sword.
19493,melessa tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,"Randyll, to be maester of the Night’s Watch is a great honor."
19494,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.
19495,dickon tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,There’s no such thing.
19496,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker’s heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He’s a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
19497,randyll tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How’d you come to meet my son?
19498,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,The Night’s Watch came to our keep.
19499,randyll tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,Where?
19500,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,Gilly.
19501,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,North of the Wall.
19502,randyll tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,North of the Wall? You’re a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?
19503,randyll tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,"It’s called Heartsbane. It’s been in our family for 500 years. It’s Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It’s supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole’s Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn’t you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home."
19504,melessa tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,"Come, my dear. Talla."
19505,melessa tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,I’ve lost my appetite.
19506,randyll tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,He dishonors us.
19507,melessa tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,You dishonor yourself.
19508,randyll tarly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING HALL_1,"Your mother’s a fine woman. You’re not worthy of her. To please her, I’ll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill."
19509,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1,I’m sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he’d turn you and Little Sam away.
19510,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1,I’m not angry at you. I’m angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?
19511,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1,First light.
19512,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1,Say good-bye to him for me.
19513,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1,"You’re not what he thinks you are, Sam. He doesn’t know what you are."
19514,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1,"Good-bye, Gilly."
19515,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1,Sam?
19516,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1,We’re leaving.
19517,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1,What?
19518,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1,Get your things.
19519,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1,I don’t have any things.
19520,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1,What are you doing?
19521,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER_1,We belong together. All of us.
19522,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,What about your mother and sister?
19523,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,"Oh, they’ll understand."
19524,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,Your sister’s dress.
19525,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,She won’t mind. Looks better on you anyway.
19526,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,Sam. That’s your father’s sword.
19527,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,It’s my family’s sword.
19528,gilly,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,Sam. Won’t he come for it?
19529,sam,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,He can bloody well try.
19530,clarenzo,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,The lion and the rose are one. I thank the gods above.
19531,clarenzo,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,"And to you, my beauteous bridge, I pledge undying love."
19533,clarenzo,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,"I’ll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer. Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?"
19534,bobono,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,"Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine."
19535,bobono,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,The last drink he shall ever take. And vengeance shall be mine.
19536,clarenzo,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,Poison! Murder! I gasp. I- - I die.
19537,clarenzo,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,I limp. And it was he…
19538,clarenzo,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,...that poisoned me. My evil Uncle Imp.
19539,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,"My firstborn son. My golden lion foully, falsely slain. I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain."
19540,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,"Hear my prayer, O cruel gods. Take my life instead. For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead. Oh, woe. Oh grief."
19541,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,"Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow. All hope is lost. All joy is gone. And there is no tomorrow."
19542,bobono,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,What is that I hear and smell? Someone I’ll soon send to hell.
19543,bobono,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,It’s time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
19544,izembaro,6,56,blood of my blood,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER_1,You beast. You beast. You killed my wife and now you’ve taken your father’s life.

19546,izembaro,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE_1,Curse the day I named you.
19547,bobono,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE_1,My greatest crime. Now I must flee.
19548,bobono,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_3,Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.
19549,bobono,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_3,Don’t fear the winter.
19550,bobono,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE_3,Fear me!

19555,camello,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That’s a dear.
19556,izembaro,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,That crowd was shit.
19557,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,Girl.
19558,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,What are you doing back here?
19559,arya stark,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,Nothing.
19560,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,I saw you the other day in the audience. How many times have you seen this stupid play?
19561,arya stark,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,Three times.
19562,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,Did you pay?
19563,arya stark,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,No.
19564,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,"I remember when the players came to my village. I didn’t have any money, so I snuck in. Just like you. Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other’s arms. I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back."
19565,arya stark,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,You’re very good.
19566,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,My final speech is shit.
19567,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,"But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing’s no good."
19568,arya stark,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,"So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you."
19569,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,How would you change it?
19570,arya stark,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn’t just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
19571,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,What’s your name?
19572,arya stark,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,Mercy.
19573,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,"You have very expressive eyes, Mercy."
19574,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,Wonderful eyebrows. Do you like pretending to be other people?
19575,arya stark,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,I have to go. My father’s waiting for me.
19576,bianca,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,"Lady Crane, they loved you."
19577,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,They were sweet. Or drunk. Drunkenly sweet.
19578,izembaro,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,No laugh for Ned’s death. These people are worse than animals.
19579,izembaro,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,But they loved her. They all love her.
19580,camello,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,"Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike."
19581,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,I do what I can with what I’m given.
19582,izembaro,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,With what you’re given?
19583,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,"Well, I was thinking- -"
19584,izembaro,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,"Oh, we’re all thinkers now, are we?"
19585,izembaro,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,Full to the tits with ideas.
19586,lady crane,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,I didn’t mean- -
19587,izembaro,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,"You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I’ve been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I’m doing."
19588,izembaro,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,You have no right to an opinion.
19589,arya stark,6,56,blood of my blood,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE_7,Careful of that one. She wants you dead.

19592,jaqen h'ghar,6,56,blood of my blood,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING CHAMBER_1,A shame. A girl had many gifts.
19593,waif,6,56,blood of my blood,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING CHAMBER_1,You promised me.

19599,high sparrow,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1,"Rich or poor, noble or common, if we win, we must atone. Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner. She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied. She turned a blind eye to her brother’s sins. She disgraces her house, the king, and herself."

19608,jaime lannister,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1,You already insulted one great house. It won’t happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.
19609,high sparrow,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1,To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.
19611,high sparrow,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1,Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.
19612,high sparrow,6,56,blood of my blood,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_1,Together we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.

But not in this city.THE CROSSING - DINING HALLWALDER FREY is sitting in a high chair addressing two of his sons, BLACK WALDER and LOTHAR. One of his young daughter stands beside him. Many other family members sit at the tables, eating."
19624,walder frey,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,You’ve lost it?
19625,walder rivers,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"Yes, father."
19626,walder frey,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"It’s a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn’t lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you."
19627,lothar frey,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.
19628,walder frey,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn’t find him. That’s what it means to lose something. Now he’s come back and taken Riverrun."
19629,walder rivers,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,I don’t think it’s fair to blame us- -
19630,walder frey,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back."
19631,walder rivers,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,We don’t have the men.
19632,walder frey,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,We’ve got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.
19633,walder rivers,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.
19634,lothar frey,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps."
19635,walder rivers,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.
19636,walder frey,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"If I want excuses, I’ll put her in charge. They’re laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to King’s Landing, they’re laughing at us."
19637,walder frey,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"I hear it in my sleep! I’m not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I’ll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back."
19638,lothar frey,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"He’ll never yield, Father."
19639,walder frey,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"Oh, he’ll yield."
19640,walder frey,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"You’ll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark’s child in his whore mother’s belly, and you’ll show him the knife you used to open his niece’s throat. And you’ll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew."

19642,jaime lannister,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,I’m being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can’t manage it on his own because he’s 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.
19643,cersei lannister,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,BEtter you’re elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.
19644,jaime lannister,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,I’m not going to the Riverlands.
19645,cersei lannister,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"What, then?"
19646,jaime lannister,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,I’m going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone’s ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I’ll take them to the sept and I’ll remove the High Sparrow’s head and every other sparrow head I can find.
19647,cersei lannister,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,You can’t.
19648,jaime lannister,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,He has our son! He stole our son! He’s torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?
19649,cersei lannister,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won’t leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it’s ours and because you can."
19650,jaime lannister,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,You’ll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.
19651,cersei lannister,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They’ve made us both stronger, all of them."
19652,cersei lannister,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we’re going to do to them.
19653,cersei lannister,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,We’ve always been together. We’ll always be together. We’re the only two people in the world.
19654,meera reed,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,Why did you help us?
19656,meera reed,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,The Three-Eyed Raven’s dead.
19659,bran stark,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,Who are you?
19660,bran stark,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
19661,benjen stark,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walker’s magic from taking hold.
19662,bran stark,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,How?
19663,benjen stark,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.
19664,bran stark,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.
19665,benjen stark,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.
19666,bran stark,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,I didn’t have time to learn. I can’t control anything.
19667,benjen stark,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.
19668,benjen stark,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,Drink.
19669,benjen stark,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men. When he does, you will be there waiting for him.

19671,daenerys targaryen,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,How many days’ ride to Meereen?
19672,daario naharis,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,A week at best.
19673,daenerys targaryen,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
19674,daario naharis,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons- - 1,000 ships easily. Probably more."
19675,daenerys targaryen,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,And who has that many?
19676,daario naharis,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,Nobody.
19677,daenerys targaryen,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,Nobody yet.
19678,daario naharis,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?
19679,daenerys targaryen,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,I take what is mine.
19680,daario naharis,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,You weren’t made to sit on a chair in a palance.
19681,daenerys targaryen,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,What was I made for?
19682,daario naharis,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"You’re a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn."
19683,daenerys targaryen,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,Wait here.
19684,daario naharis,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,I’m going after her. Wait for me here.
19685,daenerys targaryen,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.
19686,daenerys targaryen,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?
19687,daenerys targaryen,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
19688,daenerys targaryen,6,56,blood of my blood,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_1,"Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?"

19694,ray,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_81,"Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?"
19695,ray,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_81,"Here you are, son."
19696,ray,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_81,"Oh, gentlemen, please."
19697,ray,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_81,In all my days I’ve never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?
19698,sandor clegane,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_81,Just one.
19699,ray,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_81,Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.
19700,sandor clegane,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_81,He was a woman.
19701,ray,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
19702,sandor clegane,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,I’m used to it.
19703,ray,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"When I found you, I thought you’d been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there."
19704,ray,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn’t. Now, I reckoned you’d die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn’t. What kept you going?"
19705,sandor clegane,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,Hate.
19706,ray,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"No, there’s a reason you’re still here."
19707,sandor clegane,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"Aye, there’s a reason. I’m a big fucker and I’m tough to kill."
19708,ray,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"No, a reason. Gods aren’t done with you yet."
19709,sandor clegane,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"I’ve heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though."
19710,ray,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"Well, maybe he was right. I don’t know much about the gods."
19711,sandor clegane,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,You’re in the wrong line of work.
19712,ray,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"Oh, there’s plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don’t. I don’t even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it’s the old gods. Or maybe it’s the Lord of Light. Or maybe they’re all the same fucking thing. I don’t know. What matters, I believe, is that there’s something greater than us. And whatever it is, it’s got plans for Sandor Clegane."
19713,sandor clegane,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,You didn’t know me back in my time. You don’t know the things I’ve done.
19714,ray,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,I’ve heard stories.
19715,sandor clegane,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,If the gods are real...why haven’t they punished me?
19716,ray,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,They have.
19717,high sparrow,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,Your Grace. What are we reading today?
19718,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12."
19719,high sparrow,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"Ah, “As water rounds the stones, smoothing- -”"
19720,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"“Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman’s love calm a man’s brute nature. A wife salves her husband’s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.”"
19721,high sparrow,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don’t have a drop of the Mother’s mercy in their blood and savages who can’t read at all who understand the Father’s wisdom."
19722,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me."
19723,high sparrow,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,They are hard to love.
19724,high sparrow,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we’d look like without our fine clothes. How’d we smell without perfume."
19725,high sparrow,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,Can I ask you about a personal matter?
19726,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,Of course.
19727,high sparrow,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven’t joined him in the marriage bed."
19728,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,No.
19729,high sparrow,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves."
19730,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,It’s just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.
19731,high sparrow,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"Congress does not require desire on the woman’s part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work."
19732,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.
19733,high sparrow,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you’ve made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.
19734,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,My grandmother?
19735,high sparrow,6,57,the broken man,BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT_1,"Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul."
19736,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
19737,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.
19738,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,"Oh, this is madness!"
19739,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,"You’re not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about..."
19740,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,Grandmother.
19741,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,...until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
19742,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,"Grandmother, please."
19743,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,What have they done to you?
19744,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,"You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith."
19745,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,We marched for you.
19746,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,"The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn’t. They showed mercy."
19747,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
19748,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,"Loras’s only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He’ll have to renounce his name and title..."
19749,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,Have you lost your mind?
19750,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER_1,...and live his life as a penitent.
19751,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_83,He can begin again.
19752,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_83,As a mindless fanatic.
19753,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_83,As a free man.
19754,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_83,You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.
19755,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_83,I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.
19756,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_83,"But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home."
19757,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_83,I will never leave you. Never.
19758,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_83,You must.
19759,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_83,Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.
19760,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_83,The Mother watches over us all.
19761,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_83,"I’ll see you soon, my dear."
19762,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_83,"Seven blessings to you, Grandmother."
19763,margaery tyrell,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_83,Shall we pray?
19764,dim dalba,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,"We said we’d fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn’t what we agreed to. These aren’t White Walkers. This isn’t an army of the dead. This isn’t our find."
19765,tormund,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,"If it weren’t for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King’s army. And I’d be a pile of charred bones just like Mance."
19766,dim dalba,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,"Remember Mance’s camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what’s left of us. And if we lose this, we’re gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We’ll be the last of the free folk."
19767,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,"That’s what’ll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you’re here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they’ll come for you. You’re right. This isn’t your fight. You shouldn’t have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn’t be asking you. It’s not the deal we made. I need you with me if we’re gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you’re going to survive."
19768,tormund,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,"The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we’re cowards. And if that’s what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk."
19769,wun wun,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,Snow.
19770,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,Are you sure they’ll come?
19771,tormund,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,"We’re not clever like you southerners. When we say we’ll do something, we do it."
19772,cersei lannister,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,I heard you were leaving King’s Landing.
19773,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,That is hardly your concern.
19774,cersei lannister,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,Your grandson is still a prisoner. You’ll leave him rotting in a cell?
19775,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
19776,cersei lannister,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,You’re right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
19777,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,Good.
19778,cersei lannister,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
19779,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,"I wonder if you’re the worst person I’ve ever met. At a certain age, it’s hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I’ll never forget it."
19780,cersei lannister,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It’s the only truth I know. We must defend them.
19781,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,"I’m leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you’re half as bright as you think you are, you’ll find your way out of here, too."
19782,cersei lannister,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,Never. I’ll never leave my son.
19783,olenna tyrell,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,"What’ll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother’s gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You’re surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You’re going to kill them all by yourself? You’ve lost, Cersei. It’s the only joy I can find in all this misery."
19786,bronn,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,"Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches."
19787,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,Someone certainly does.
19788,bronn,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,"Oh, no. Not me. I’m just an upjumped sellsword."
19789,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,You’re an anointed knight. There’s quite a difference.
19790,bronn,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,"Aye, knights don’t get paid."
19791,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
19792,bronn,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,That’s like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
19793,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
19794,bronn,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
19795,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,And you’ll get all three. A Lannister always- -
19796,bronn,6,57,the broken man,RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY_1,Don’t say it. Don’t fucking say it.
19797,lothar frey,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,"Come out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we’ll hang him."
19798,lothar frey,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,This is your last warning. Yield the castle.
19799,walder rivers,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,"You think I won’t do it, old man?"
19800,walder rivers,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,I sliced your niece’s throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
19801,brynden tully (blackfish),6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,"Go on, then. Cut his throat."
19802,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,"Lothar, is it?"
19803,lothar frey,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,Ser Jaime. We didn’t know you were coming.
19804,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,"‘Cause you didn’t set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged."
19805,bronn,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,Good thing we’re friends or we’d be fucking you in the ass right now.
19806,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
19807,walder rivers,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,"Whoa, whoa."
19808,lothar frey,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,Walder.
19809,walder rivers,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.
19810,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,"Only a fool makes threats he’s not prepared to carry out. Now let’s say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I’d do?"
19811,walder rivers,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,I don’t give a rat’s- -
19812,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,I’m here by the king’s command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you’d like to take his place.
19813,lothar frey,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,"Apologies, Ser Jaime."
19814,lothar frey,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,Do as he says.
19815,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,"The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he’ll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is."
19816,bronn,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
19817,walder rivers,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,Those are our siege towers- -
19818,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,"As I said, the siege is under my command. If that’s not to your liking, go home."
19819,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
19820,bronn,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,A parley or a fight?
19821,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,He’s an old man.
19822,bronn,6,57,the broken man,RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT_1,You’ve got one hand. My money’s on the old boy.EXT. BEAR ISLANDThe castle of House Mormont sits atop a high hill. Waterfalls pour out below. A bird screeches.
19823,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,Lady Mormont.
19824,lyanna stark,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,Welcome to Bear Island.
19825,sansa stark,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I’m sure you will be, too."
19826,lyanna stark,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"I doubt it. My mother wasn’t a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb."
19827,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -"
19828,lyanna stark,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,I think we’ve had enough small talk. What are you here?
19829,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
19830,lyanna stark,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”
19831,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I’ve come with my sister to ask for House Mormont’s allegiance."
19832,lyanna stark,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"As far as I understand, you’re a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I’ve heard conflicting reports."
19833,sansa stark,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark."
19834,lyanna stark,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"If you say so. In any case, you don’t just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men."
19835,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -"
19836,lyanna stark,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,I understand that I’m responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else’s war?
19837,davos seaworth,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel."
19838,lyanna stark,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"I don’t know you, Ser…?"
19839,davos seaworth,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth."
19840,davos seaworth,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,You needn’t ask your maester about my house. It’s rather new.
19841,lyanna stark,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?"
19842,davos seaworth,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"You never thought you’d find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I’d be in my position. I was a crabber’s son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I’m here because this isn’t someone else’s war. It’s our war."
19843,lyanna stark,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"Go on, Ser Davos."
19844,davos seaworth,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn’t between a few squabbling houses. It’s between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming."
19845,lyanna stark,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,Is this true?
19846,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
19847,davos seaworth,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won’t stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there’s no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together."
19848,lyanna stark,6,57,the broken man,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER_1,"House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today."
19849,lyanna stark,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,62.
19850,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,62?
19851,lyanna stark,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,"We are not a large house, but we’re a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders."
19852,davos seaworth,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,"If they’re half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed."
19853,brynden tully (blackfish),6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,Kingslayer.
19854,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,Blackfish.
19855,brynden tully (blackfish),6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,I assume you’re here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don’t see Sansa and Arya.
19856,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,I don’t have them.
19857,brynden tully (blackfish),6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?
19858,brynden tully (blackfish),6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,Then why are you here?
19859,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,"You know why I’m here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You’re trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -"
19860,brynden tully (blackfish),6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,Or you’ll kill Edmure?
19861,brynden tully (blackfish),6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,My nephew’s marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
19862,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,It won’t stop with Edmure. You’ll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
19863,brynden tully (blackfish),6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.
19864,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,"We’ll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I’ll spare the lives of your men. On my honor."
19865,brynden tully (blackfish),6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
19866,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,"The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?"
19867,brynden tully (blackfish),6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,"As long as I’m standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I’m ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?"
19868,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,You clearly have no intention of saving your men’s lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
19869,brynden tully (blackfish),6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,"Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you."
19870,jaime lannister,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,"Well, now you have."
19871,brynden tully (blackfish),6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,"Aye, now I have. I’m disappointed."
19872,robett glover,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,The answer is no.
19873,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,"Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out."
19874,robett glover,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,I’ve heard enough. We’ve only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.
19875,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
19876,robett glover,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?
19877,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,House Mormont.
19878,robett glover,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,And?
19879,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -
19880,robett glover,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,I don’t care about ravens. You’re asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?
19881,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
19882,robett glover,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,Then the rumors are true. I didn’t dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.
19883,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,Lord Glover.
19884,robett glover,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,There’s nothing else to say.
19885,sansa stark,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.
19886,robett glover,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,"Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father’s death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb’s call and hailed him King in the North."
19887,robett glover,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.
19888,robett glover,6,57,the broken man,Unnamed Scene_85,"I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead."
19889,theon greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,Why did we have to come here?
19890,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.
19891,theon greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,I don’t want one.
19892,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"Don’t go far, love."
19893,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,I’ll find you in a bit.
19894,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn’t interest you anymore?
19895,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"I’m sorry. I won’t joke about it. I’ll never hurt you, little brother. Don’t you know that?"
19896,theon greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,You think Uncle Euron’s hunting for us?
19897,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"Of course he is. As long as we’re alive, we’re a threat."
19898,theon greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,He’ll find us.
19899,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,It’s a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.
19900,theon greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,I don’t want any.
19901,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,I don’t care what you want. Drink.
19902,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,Drink it all.
19903,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"You’re Ironborn, Theon. I know you’ve had some bad years."
19904,theon greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,Some bad years?
19905,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,But I’m tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.
19906,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink."
19907,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you’re never going back. We’ll get justice for you."
19908,theon greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell."
19909,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"Fuck justice, then. We’ll get revenge. Drink."
19910,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"Listen to me. If you’re so broken that there’s no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you’re staying, Theon, I need you. We’re gonna sail to Meereen. We’re gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we’re gonna take back the Iron Islands."
19911,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,Are you with me? Are you really with me?
19912,yara greyjoy,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"Now, since it’s my last night ashore for a long while, I’m gonna go fuck the tits off this one."
19913,davos seaworth,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
19914,sansa stark,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,And that’s a good thing?
19915,davos seaworth,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There’s a stream down there for the horses.
19916,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,We’re not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
19917,davos seaworth,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did."
19918,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
19919,davos seaworth,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"2,000 Wildlings. 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins- -"
19920,sansa stark,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,62 Mormonts.
19921,davos seaworth,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,It’s not what we’d hoped for. But we still have a chance if we’re careful and smart.
19922,davos seaworth,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,For fuck’s sake.
19923,sansa stark,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,So he’s your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
19924,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,Ser Davos is the reason I’m standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
19925,sansa stark,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn’t have a head?"
19926,sansa stark,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,It’s not enough. We need more men.
19927,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,There’s no time.
19928,sansa stark,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord- -"
19929,jon snow,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,We fight with the army we have.
19930,davos seaworth,6,57,the broken man,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR_1,"Friends, this is not worth fighting over!"

19935,ray,6,57,the broken man,NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT_1,"I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn’t. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That’s all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I’m your arsonist. Steal that farmer’s crops. Good, I’m your thief. Kill those young lads so they won’t take up arms against us. I’m your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren’t animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy’s throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back."

All I can do with time I’ve got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That’s all any of us can do, isn’t it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people.

20271,grey worm,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,"We’ll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here."
20272,tyrion lannister,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,And then?
20273,grey worm,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them.
20274,beric dondarrion,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,Clegane.
20275,thoros,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,What the fuck you doing here?
20276,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,Chasing them. You?
20277,thoros,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,Hanging them.
20278,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,Any particular reason?
20279,beric dondarrion,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,They’re our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
20280,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.
20281,thoros,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,You’ve got friends?
20282,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,Not anymore. They’re mine.
20283,beric dondarrion,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,It’s the Brotherhood’s good name they’ve dragged through the dirt.
20284,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,"Fuck your name. They’re mine. I killed you once before, Dondarrion. Happy to do it again."
20285,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,"Drop that arrow, you bloody girl."
20286,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.
20287,beric dondarrion,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,You can have one of them.
20288,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,Two.
20289,thoros,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,"No, no, no."
20290,thoros,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,We’re not butchers. We hang them.
20291,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,hanging? All over in an instant. Where’s the punishment in that?
20292,thoros,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,They die.
20293,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,We all bloody die.
20294,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,Except this one here. I’ll only gut one of them.
20295,beric dondarrion,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,No.
20296,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,I’ll chop off one hand.
20297,beric dondarrion,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That’s generous.
20298,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,Bunch of nancies.
20299,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
20300,thoros,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,"You’re getting old, Clegane."
20301,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,He’s not.
20302,lem,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,Please don’t. I’ll give you anything.
20303,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM_1,Got anything to eat?
20304,thoros,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,Enjoying yourself?
20305,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,I prefer chicken.
20306,beric dondarrion,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,You ought to join us. We could use you.
20307,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,I tried joining. Didn’t work out for me.
20308,thoros,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,"Clegane, we’re here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves."
20309,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.
20310,beric dondarrion,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,Cold winds are rising in the North.
20311,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,And you’re going to go stop them?
20312,beric dondarrion,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,We need good men to help us.
20313,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,"Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me."
20314,beric dondarrion,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?
20315,sandor clegane,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,"I beat you because I’m better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I’m better than you now."
20316,beric dondarrion,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,"Aye, you’re probably right. You’re a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we’re fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you’ve harmed Clegane, it’s not too late for you.INT. BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENTARYA is sleeping. LADY CRANE enters the bedroom, sits down beside ARYA, and strokes her face. ARYA stirs and groans. LADY CRANE stands and walks back into the abutting room. She retrieves a stool and stands atop it, reaching for a bottle on top of a bureau. She turns around and sees a young man with blonde hair. Cut to ARYA’s perspective. There is a thud. ARYA awakens with a gasp and looks around. She sees a shadow moving in the abutting room."
20317,arya stark,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,Lady Crane?
20318,arya stark,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,Lady Crane?
20319,waif,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,"If you’d have done your job, she would have died painlessly."
20320,waif,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,Instead…
20321,waif,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,The Many-Faced God was promised a name. He must always receive what is his. You can’t change that. I can’t change that. No one can. And now he’s been promised another name.
20322,waif,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?
20323,waif,6,58,no one,RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT_1,Haven’t we been through this already? That won’t help you.
20324,arya stark,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,You told her to kill me.
20325,jaqen h'ghar,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Yes. But here you are. And there she is.
20326,jaqen h'ghar,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,Finally a girl is no one.
20327,arya stark,6,58,no one,BRAAVOS - HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE_1,A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I’m going home.
20328,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_87,"Despite appearances, I think you’ll find the city’s on the rise."
20329,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_87,Perhaps we should take shelter.
20330,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_87,The city is on the rise?
20331,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_87,Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
20332,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_87,"Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…"
20333,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_87,...it proves that no one needs a Master.
20334,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_87,Good. Shall we begin?
20335,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_87,Do we have a plan?
20336,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_87,"I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan."
20337,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_87,You don’t approve?
20338,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_87,You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King’s Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
20339,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_87,"Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That’s why Jaime killed him."
20340,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_87,This is entirely different.
20341,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_87,You’re talking about destroying cities. It’s not entirely different. I’d like to suggest an alternate approach.
20342,razdal mo eraz,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_1,"Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver’s Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are."
20343,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_1,"We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults."
20344,yezzan zo qaggaz,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_1,The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
20345,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_1,"We obviously didn’t communicate clearly. We’re here to discuss your surrender, not mine."
20346,razdal mo eraz,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_1,I imagine it’s difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.
20347,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_1,My reign has just begun.
20348,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - HARBOR_1,Dracarys.
20349,grey worm,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,You men have a choice
20350,grey worm,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,"...fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families."
20351,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,"Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven."
20352,missandei,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
20353,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,"It always seems a bit abstract, doesn’t it, other people dying?"
20354,razdal mo eraz,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,Him. He should die.
20355,belicho paenymion,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,"Yes, him."
20356,razdal mo eraz,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,"He’s not one of us. He’s an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us."
20357,yezzan zo qaggaz,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,Please.
20358,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,"Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen."
20359,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,You don’t have to be here.
20360,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,"Yes, I do."
20361,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,My beloved wife. I’ve missed you terribly.
20362,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,"Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night’s Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don’t have the men, you don’t have the horses, and you don’t have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There’s no need for a battle. Get off your horse and kneel. I’m a man of mercy."
20363,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,You’re right. There’s no need for a battle. Thousands of men don’t need to die. Only one of us. Let’s end this the old way. You against me.
20364,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,"I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you’re the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don’t know if I’d beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?"
20365,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,"Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn’t fight for them?"
20366,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,"He’s good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you’re too proud to surrender?"
20367,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,How do we know you have him?
20368,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,"Now, if you want to save —"
20369,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,"You’re going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well."
20370,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,MEEREEN - PLATEAU_3,"She’s a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you’re all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven’t fed them for seven days. They’re ravenous. I wonder which parts they’ll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We’ll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard."
20371,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"If he was smart, he’d stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
20372,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"That’s not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they’ll stop fearing him. He can’t have that. Fear is his power."
20373,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"It’s his weakness, too. His mean don’t want to fight for him. They’re forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning..."
20374,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,It’s not his men that worry me. It’s his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.
20375,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
20376,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"We’re digging trenches all along our flanks. They won’t be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment."
20377,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,A pincer move.
20378,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,They won’t be able to hit us from the sides.
20379,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,Good.
20380,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"It’s crucial that we let them charge at us. They’ve got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he’ll pursue. Then we’ll have him surrounded on three sides."
20381,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?
20382,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
20383,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,We should all get some sleep.
20384,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow."
20385,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"So you’ve met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans."
20386,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"Aye, for what they’re worth."
20387,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"You’ve known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don’t know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?"
20388,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,You’re right.
20389,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,You think he’s going to fall into your trap. He won’t He’s the one who lays traps.
20390,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,He’s overconfident.
20391,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,He plays with people. He’s far better at it than you. He’s been doing it all his life.
20392,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I’ve defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton."
20393,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,You don’t know him.
20394,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?"
20395,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"We’ll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay’s claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won’t live long."
20396,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,We can’t give up on our brother.
20397,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake."
20398,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,Of course he does. What should I do differently?
20399,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,I don’t know! I don’t know anything about battles! Just don’t do what he wants you to do.
20400,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"Aye, that’s good advice."
20401,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,You think that’s obvious?
20402,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"Well, it is a bit obvious."
20403,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?"
20404,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,When will we have a larger force?! We’ve pleaded with every house that’ll have us! The Blackfish can’t help us! We’re lucky to have this many men!
20405,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,It’s not enough!
20406,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"Now, it’s not enough! It’s what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds."
20407,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,"If Ramsay wins, I’m not going back there alive. Do you understand me?"
20408,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT_1,No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.
20409,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,You think there’s hope?
20410,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,"I’ve never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they’ve never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there’s hope. You want to avenge your king, don’t you?"
20411,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,It wasn’t the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
20412,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,You saw these demons?
20413,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,What?
20414,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,"No, it’s a manner of speaking. Not actual demons."
20415,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,"Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn’t have demons in his skull. He didn’t torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you."
20416,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,"Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings."
20417,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,Jon Snow’s not a king.
20418,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,"No, he’s not."
20419,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat’s milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
20420,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,"No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle."
20421,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,So what do you do all night?
20422,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I’m far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
20423,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT_1,Happy shitting.
20424,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,My lady. You weren’t at the war council.
20425,melisandre,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,I’m not a soldier.
20426,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,Any advice?
20427,melisandre,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,Don’t lose.
20428,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,"If I do, if I fall, don’t bring me back."
20429,melisandre,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,I’ll have to try.
20430,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,I’m ordering you not to bring me back.
20431,melisandre,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,"I am not your servant, Jon Snow."
20432,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,You’re in my camp. I’m the commander.
20433,melisandre,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.
20434,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,How do you know what he commands?
20435,melisandre,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,"I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn’t want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you."
20436,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,Why?
20437,melisandre,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,I don’t know. Maybe you’re only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
20438,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,What kind of god would do something like that?
20439,melisandre,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT_1,The one we’ve got.
20440,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,"Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf’s height thinks he’s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf’s height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You’re all making the same five or six jokes."
20441,theon greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,It was a long time ago.
20442,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,"It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can’t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well."
20443,theon greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,I didn’t murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
20444,yara greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,And he paid for them.
20445,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,"Doesn’t seem like it. He’s still alive. It was complicated for you, I’m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don’t we?"
20446,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,"You’ve brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?"
20447,theon greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Not my claim. Hers.
20448,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,And what’s wrong with you?
20449,theon greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,I’m not fit to rule.
20450,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,We can agree upon that at least.
20451,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
20452,yara greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,No more than Westeros.
20453,theon greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.
20454,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
20455,yara greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,You and I have that in common.
20456,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.
20457,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Will their ships be enough?
20458,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,"With the former Masters’ fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet."
20459,theon greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,There are and Euron is building more. He’s going to offer them to you.
20460,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,So why shouldn’t I wait for him?
20461,theon greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,The Iron Fleet isn’t all he’s bringing. He also wants to give you --
20462,yara greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,"His big cock, I think he said. Euron’s offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won’t get one without the other."
20463,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
20464,yara greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,"I never demand, but I’m up for anything, really."
20465,theon greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He’ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
20466,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,The Seven Kingdoms.
20467,theon greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,All of them.
20468,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,And you don’t want the Seven Kingdoms?
20469,theon greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
20470,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,And that’s all?
20471,yara greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,We’d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don’t think a woman’s fit to rule.
20472,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Reasonable.
20473,tyrion lannister,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
20474,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,"She’s not demanding, she’s asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We’re not going to do that. We’re going to leave the world better than we found it."
20475,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,"You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping."
20476,yara greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,That’s our way of life.
20477,daenerys targaryen,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,No more.
20478,yara greyjoy,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,No more.
20479,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,"Do you like games, little man? Let’s play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him. That’s it. That’s the game. Easy. Ready? Go."
20480,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,"No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules."
20481,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Don’t.
20482,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!
20483,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Go! Go! Follow your commander!
20484,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Run and fight!
20485,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Now.
20486,rickard karstark,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,"Cavalry, charge!"
20487,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,We’ll just kill our own men. Stand down.
20488,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Loose!
20489,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Get word --
20490,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,We may as well be taking shits back here.
20491,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Follow!
20492,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,"It’s time, go."
20493,smalljon umber,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Who owns the North?
20495,smalljon umber,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Who owns the North?
20497,smalljon umber,6,59,battle of the bastards,STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS_1,Show me!
20499,davos seaworth,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_89,"With me, lads! Break their line!"
20502,tormund,6,59,battle of the bastards,Unnamed Scene_89,"Fuck this, come on!"
20503,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1,Their army’s gone.
20505,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1,We have Winterfell. They don’t have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.
20506,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1,"You suggested one on one combat, didn’t you?"
20507,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1,I’ve reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.
20508,jon snow,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1,We’re going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.
20509,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1,Jon.
20510,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_1,Where is he?
20511,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - KENNELS_1,"Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I’ll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That’s all right. You can’t kill me. I’m part of you now."
20512,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - KENNELS_1,Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.
20513,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - KENNELS_1,My hounds will never harm me.
20514,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - KENNELS_1,You haven’t fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.
20515,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - KENNELS_1,They’re loyal beasts.
20516,sansa stark,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - KENNELS_1,They were. Now they’re starving.
20517,ramsay bolton,6,59,battle of the bastards,WINTERFELL - KENNELS_1,Sit. Down! Down! Down! Down! Down!
20520,pycelle,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - MAESTER PYCELLE’S CHAMBER_1,Later. Go away.
20522,high sparrow,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,Ser Loras Tyrell. Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?
20523,loras tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,There’ll be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.
20524,high sparrow,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,To which crimes will you be confessing?
20525,loras tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.
20526,loras tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,"I perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity… dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just."
20527,high sparrow,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,"The gods’ judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her."
20528,loras tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.
20529,high sparrow,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,You understand fully what this means?
20530,loras tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.
20531,high sparrow,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,Brother Loras…
20532,high sparrow,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,...I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.
20533,high sparrow,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,Will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates?
20534,loras tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,I will.
20535,mace tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,"No, I can’t let them…"
20536,margaery tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_5,"Faith is the way, Father."
20537,tommen baratheon,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_9,All right. I’m ready.
20538,tommen baratheon,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_9,"I have to go, I’m-- I’m late for the trial."
20539,margaery tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_7,You mutilated him. You gave me your word.
20540,high sparrow,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_7,"I’ve kept my word. Once the queen mother’s trial is concluded, Brother Loras is free to leave."
20541,margaery tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_7,And where is the queen mother?
20542,lancel lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_7,Her litter never left the Red Keep.
20543,high sparrow,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_7,It appears the queen mother doesn’t wish to attend her own trial.
20544,high sparrow,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_9,Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.
20545,lancel lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS_3,Get the others.
20546,pycelle,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB_3,Where’s the king?
20547,qyburn,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB_3,"Elsewhere, I’m afraid."
20548,pycelle,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB_3,What’s the meaning of this? I was told that-- I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence--
20549,qyburn,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB_3,"Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will. Please forgive me if you can."
20550,qyburn,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB_7,"This pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest."
20551,lancel lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS_7,"The longer you wait, the worse it’ll be for you."
20552,lancel lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS_7,What are you doing?
20553,margaery tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_15,There’s something wrong.
20554,high sparrow,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_15,"You have nothing to fear, Your Grace. The trial will begin shortly."
20555,margaery tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_15,Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here. Why do you think they are not here?
20556,high sparrow,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_15,"If the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless. We cannot escape the justice of the gods--"
20557,margaery tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_15,"Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I’m telling you. Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences. The trial can wait. We all need to leave."
20558,margaery tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_17,We all need to leave now!
20559,margaery tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_17,Loras. Stay with me.
20560,margaery tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_19,Let me through. Let me through. Get out of my way.
20561,margaery tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR_19,Let us through!
20562,cersei lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1,Confess. Confess.
20563,septa unella,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1,No.
20564,cersei lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1,Confess.
20565,cersei lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1,"Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn’t do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances."
20566,cersei lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1,You’ve always been quiet.
20567,cersei lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1,I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?
20568,septa unella,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1,Good. I’m glad to see your face. I’m ready to meet the gods.
20569,cersei lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1,What? Now? Today? You’re not going to die today. You’re not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.
20570,cersei lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1,"This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He’s quiet, too."
20571,cersei lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1,Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.
20572,septa unella,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1,No.
20573,cersei lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER_1,Shame.

20586,bronn,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,She doesn’t want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.
20587,jaime lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,Those two have their eyes on you.

20590,bronn,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,Not blonde enough?
20591,jaime lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,"Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
20592,jaime lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,There you go.
20593,bronn,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,Maybe I’m not in the mood.
20594,bronn,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,Fuck it.
20595,bronn,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,No need to call me ser just because I’m an anointed knight.
20596,walder frey,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,This came together rather well. Your father would be pleased.
20597,jaime lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,I’m sure he would be.
20598,walder frey,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,Edmure is back in a cell. Can’t go killing my son by law. It wouldn’t be right. Give the family a bad name.
20599,walder frey,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,"So the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers, eh? Legendary warrior, everyone said."
20600,jaime lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,"Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?"
20601,walder frey,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,I’m a bit old for all that.
20602,jaime lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER_13,"No, but back in your day."
20603,walder frey,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_91,I’ve defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it’s mine. What do you call that? Victory.
20604,jaime lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_91,"Yes, you’re a great conqueror."
20605,walder frey,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_91,"Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if you’re an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. But it doesn’t matter. Here we are now, two kingslayers. We know what it’s like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs. We don’t mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing."
20606,jaime lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_91,"They don’t fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?"
20607,cersei lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_91,Show me.
20608,qyburn,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_91,"Your Grace, there’s no need--"
20609,cersei lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_91,Show me.
20610,qyburn,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_91,"What are your thoughts concerning the king’s funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?"
20611,cersei lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,Unnamed Scene_91,"He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.EXT.

20612,sam,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1,Hello.
20613,sam,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1,From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.
20614,sam,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1,I’m-- I’m to be the new maester.
20617,sam,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1,He died.
20619,sam,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1,Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He’s since passed away. Which is why I’m here.
20621,sam,6,60,the winds of winter,THE CITADEL_1,"Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular."
20624,jon snow,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,"When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I’d sit down there."
20625,melisandre,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,"Could have been worse, Jon Snow. You had a family. You had feasts."
20626,jon snow,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,"Aye, you’re right. I was luckier than most."
20627,jon snow,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,What is that?
20628,davos seaworth,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.
20629,melisandre,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,The Princess Shireen.
20630,davos seaworth,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!
20631,melisandre,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,We burned her at the stake.
20632,davos seaworth,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,Why?
20633,melisandre,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.
20634,davos seaworth,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,You burned a little girl alive!
20635,melisandre,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,I only do what my Lord commands!
20636,davos seaworth,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,"If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!"
20637,melisandre,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
20638,davos seaworth,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
20639,melisandre,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.
20640,davos seaworth,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,"The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied."
20641,melisandre,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,I didn’t lie. I was wrong.
20642,davos seaworth,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,"Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?"
20643,davos seaworth,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.
20644,jon snow,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,Do you have anything to say for yourself?
20645,melisandre,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,"I’ve been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he’s not. You’ve seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war."
20646,jon snow,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,"Ride south today. If you return to the North, I’ll have you hanged as a murderer."
20647,davos seaworth,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL_3,"If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself."
20648,jon snow,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,I’m having the lord’s chamber prepared for you.
20649,sansa stark,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,Mother and Father’s room? You should take it.
20650,jon snow,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,I’m not a Stark.
20651,sansa stark,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,You are to me.
20652,jon snow,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,You’re the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We’re standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
20653,sansa stark,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,He did.
20654,jon snow,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,And you trust him?
20655,sansa stark,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,"Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I’m sorry."
20656,jon snow,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,We need to trust each other. We can’t fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.
20657,sansa stark,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,Jon.
20658,sansa stark,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.
20659,jon snow,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,"Well, Father always promised, didn’t he?"
20660,olenna tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,"The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?"
20661,ellaria sand,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,"You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna."
20662,olenna tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,"You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?"
20663,obara sand,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?
20664,olenna tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,What is your name again? Barbaro?
20665,obara sand,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,Obara.
20666,olenna tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don’t presume to tell me what I need.
20667,nymeria,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,"Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes--"
20668,olenna tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,"Do shut up, dear."
20669,olenna tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,Anything from you?
20670,olenna tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
20671,ellaria sand,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
20672,olenna tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I’m after now.
20673,ellaria sand,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,You’re absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart’s desire.
20674,olenna tyrell,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,And what is my heart’s desire?
20675,ellaria sand,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,Vengeance. Justice.

20677,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,Your ships are nearly ready. I saw them painting the sails.
20678,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,I’m curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.
20679,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,You’re not coming with us.
20680,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,"New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King’s Landing."
20681,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,You’re not going to Westeros. You’re staying here with the Second Sons. There’s finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
20682,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,"Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I’m here for you, not them."
20683,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,"You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I’m going to rule in Westeros, I’ll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage."
20684,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,Who are you marrying this time?
20685,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,I don’t know. Maybe no one.
20686,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?
20687,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,I can’t bring a lover to Westeros.
20688,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,A king wouldn’t think twice about it.
20689,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,So that’s what you want? To be my mistress?
20690,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,I’m not proud. I don’t care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don’t want a crown. I want you.
20691,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.
20692,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,I can’t.
20693,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,The dwarf told you to do this.
20694,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,No one tells me to do anything.
20695,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,Clever fellow. Can’t argue with his logic. I’m no use to you over there.
20696,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,Don’t get angry.
20697,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,"I’m not angry. I’m full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?"
20698,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,"A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons."
20699,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,Bay of Dragons?
20700,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,"We can’t call it Slaver’s Bay anymore, can we?"
20701,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,"You’ll get that throne you want so badly, I’m sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness."
20702,daario naharis,6,60,the winds of winter,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL_1,I pity the lord of Westeros. They have no idea what’s coming for them.

20704,tyrion lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,How did he take it?
20705,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,No tears.
20706,tyrion lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That’s the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it’s any consolation."
20707,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,It’s not.
20708,tyrion lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"No, I suppose not. I’m terrible at consoling."
20709,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"Yes, you really are."
20710,tyrion lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you’ve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It’s all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?"
20711,tyrion lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,Good. You’re in the great game now. And the great game’s terrifying. The only people who aren’t afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
20712,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.
20713,tyrion lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,He wasn’t the first to love you and he won’t be the last.
20714,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"Well, you have completely failed to console me."
20715,tyrion lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"For what it’s worth, I’ve been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone’s always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am."
20716,tyrion lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"I believe in you. It’s embarrassing, really. I’d swear you my sword, but I don’t actually own a sword."
20717,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,It’s your counsel I need.
20718,tyrion lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,It’s yours. Now and always.
20719,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I’m not sure if it’s right."
20720,daenerys targaryen,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen."
20721,walder frey,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"You’re not one of mine, are you?"
20722,handmaiden,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"No, my lord."
20723,walder frey,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,Didn’t think so. Too pretty.
20724,walder frey,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,Where are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.
20725,handmaiden,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"They’re here, my lord."
20726,walder frey,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now."
20727,handmaiden,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"But they’re already here, my lord."
20728,handmaiden,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"Here, my lord."
20729,handmaiden,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,They weren’t easy to carve. Especially Black Walder.
20730,walder frey,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,What…
20731,arya stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you’re ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.
20732,petyr baelish,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"Forgive me, my lady… if you’re at prayer."
20733,sansa stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"I’m done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had."
20734,sansa stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,I was a stupid girl.
20735,petyr baelish,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,You were a child.
20736,sansa stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,What do you want?
20737,petyr baelish,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,I thought you knew what I wanted.
20738,sansa stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,I was wrong.
20739,petyr baelish,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"No, you weren’t. Every time I’m faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne… and you by my side."
20740,sansa stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,It’s a pretty picture.
20741,petyr baelish,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. I’ve declared for House Stark for all to hear.
20742,sansa stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"You’ve declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It’s never stopped you from serving yourself."
20743,petyr baelish,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You, my love, are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?"
20744,benjen stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,This is where I leave you.
20745,meera reed,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,You’re not coming with us?
20746,benjen stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"The Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass."
20747,meera reed,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,Where will you go?

20749,bran stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"Thank you, Uncle Benjen."
20750,benjen stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,I wish you both good fortune.
20751,meera reed,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,Are you sure you’re ready for this?
20752,bran stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,I’m the Three-Eyed Raven now. I have to be ready for this.
20753,lyanna stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,Ned?
20754,eddard stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,Lyanna.
20755,lyanna stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,Is that you? Is that really you?
20756,lyanna stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,You’re not a dream.
20757,eddard stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"No, I’m not a dream. I’m here. Right here."
20758,lyanna stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"I’ve missed you, big brother."
20759,eddard stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"I’ve missed you, too."
20760,lyanna stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,I want to be brave.
20761,eddard stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,Shh. You are.
20762,lyanna stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,I’m not.
20763,lyanna stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,I don’t want to die.
20764,eddard stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,You’re not going to die.
20765,eddard stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,Get her some water!
20766,lyanna stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"No, no water."
20767,eddard stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,Is there a maester?
20768,lyanna stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"Please. Listen to me, Ned."
20769,lyanna stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"If Robert finds out, he’ll kill him, you know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me."
20770,lyanna stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"Promise me, Ned. Promise me."
20772,tormund,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,We didn’t invade. We were invited.
20774,jon snow,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield."
20776,jon snow,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won’t wait out the storm. He brings the storm."
20777,lyanna stark,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly. But you refused the call. You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refuse the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don’t care if he’s a bastard. Ned Stark’s blood runs through his veins. He’s my king from this day until his last day."
20778,house manderly,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly. My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. I didn’t think we’d find another king in my lifetime. I didn’t commit my men to your cause ‘cause I didn’t want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. The King in the North."
20779,robett glover,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.
20780,jon snow,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,"There’s nothing to forgive, my lord."
20781,robett glover,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,There will be more fights to come. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years. And I will stand behind Jon Snow… the King in the North!
20782,robett glover,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,The King in the North!
20784,jaime lannister,6,60,the winds of winter,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM_1,Come on.

20788,walder frey,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_92,"You're wonder why I brought you all here. After all, we just had a feast. Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?"
20789,walder frey,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_92,"Well, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say!"
20790,walder frey,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_92,"I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come. But first, a toast! No more of that Dornish horse piss! This is the finest Arbor gold! Proper wine for proper heroes!"
20791,walder frey,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_92,Stand together!
20793,walder frey,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_92,Not you. I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.
20794,walder frey,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_92,"Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot. You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding."
20795,walder frey,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_92,"Yes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home. But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks."
20796,walder frey,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_92,"No, no, that was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out, root and stem."
20797,walder frey,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_92,Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.
20798,arya stark,7,61,dragonstone,Unnamed Scene_92,"When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey."

20800,meera reed,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,"I'm Meera Reed, daughter of Howland Reed. This is Brandon Stark, son of Ned Stark."
20801,eddison tollett,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,How do I know that's true?
20802,bran stark,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,You were at the Fist of the First Men. You were at Hardhome. You've seen the Army of the Dead. You've seen the Night King. He's coming for us. For all of us.
20803,eddison tollett,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,"Okay, come on. Let's get them inside."
20804,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,"I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow."
20805,robett glover,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.
20806,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,Not just the boys.
20807,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.
20808,robett glover,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?
20809,lyanna stark,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,"I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you."
20810,robett glover,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,"Indeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned--"
20811,lyanna stark,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,And I don't need your permission to defend the North.
20812,lyanna stark,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,"We'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island."
20813,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,"While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk."
20814,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,But if we're going to survive this winter together...
20815,tormund,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,You want us to man the castles for you?
20816,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
20817,tormund,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,Then that's where I'll go. Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.
20818,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,"If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold."
20819,yohn royce,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North. Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.
20820,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,"The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay."
20822,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.
20823,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,And then they broke faith.
20824,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.
20825,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?
20826,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
20827,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.
20828,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,"When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final."
20829,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,Ned Umber.
20830,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,Alys Karstark.
20831,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,"For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon."
20832,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,Stand.
20833,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE_1,"Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?"
20835,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"You are my sister, but I am king now."
20836,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Will you start wearing a crown?
20837,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
20838,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,So I can't question your decisions anymore?
20839,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"Of course you can, but--"
20840,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?
20841,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Do you think I'm Joffrey?
20842,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
20843,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Thank you.
20844,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"You're good at this, you know."
20845,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,At what?
20846,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,At ruling.
20847,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,No.
20848,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--"
20849,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Why are you laughing?
20850,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit."
20851,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,He never said that to me.
20852,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls."
20853,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying."
20854,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me."
20855,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,I'm not trying to undermine you.
20856,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it."
20857,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
20858,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Would that be so terrible?
20859,wolkan,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace."
20860,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"""Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"""
20861,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,What does she want?
20862,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
20863,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south."
20864,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too."
20865,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
20866,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
20867,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder."
20868,jon snow,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,You almost sound as if you admire her.
20869,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"I learned a great deal from her.EXT. KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP COURTYARDCERSEI walks atop a mural of Westeros painted on the floor. The painter is completing it. JAIME enters and walks towards CERSEI, then looks at the mural and nods at the painter. The painter puts down his brush and exits."
20870,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,What is this?
20871,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not."
20872,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain."
20873,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"It's ours now, we just have to take it."
20874,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
20875,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"No, not angry."
20876,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Are you afraid of me?
20877,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Should I be?
20878,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?"
20879,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Dragonstone.
20880,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born."
20881,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Enemies to the east.
20882,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.
20883,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor."
20884,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
20885,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock."
20886,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
20887,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side."
20888,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
20889,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in."
20890,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
20891,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.
20892,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"A dynasty for us, then."
20893,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,We never talked about Tommen.
20894,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,There's nothing to say.
20895,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Our baby boy killed himself.
20896,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?"
20897,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Cersei--
20898,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count."
20899,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
20900,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
20901,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,"We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone."
20902,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY_1,You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
20903,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1,The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
20904,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1,Not all of them.
20905,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1,"Well, it looks like all of them."
20906,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1,"I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are."
20907,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1,How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
20908,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1,"So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing."
20909,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1,"They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves."
20910,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1,Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
20911,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1,"Oh, what did he come here for, then?"
20912,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY_1,A queen.
20913,euron greyjoy,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,"The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you."
20914,euron greyjoy,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,"It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together."
20915,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,"You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?"
20916,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,"The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."
20917,euron greyjoy,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,"I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance."
20918,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
20919,euron greyjoy,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.
20920,jaime lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
20921,euron greyjoy,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,"A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas."
20922,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,If not the most humble.
20923,euron greyjoy,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,"You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south."
20924,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,What do you want in return?
20925,euron greyjoy,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,"Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands."
20926,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,I decline your proposal.
20927,euron greyjoy,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,Why?
20928,cersei lannister,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
20929,euron greyjoy,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,You should try it. Feels wonderful.
20930,euron greyjoy,7,61,dragonstone,KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL_1,"I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you."
20931,marwyn,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,"Ah, Maester Weyland. A drinker's liver if ever I saw one."
20932,marwyn,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,Weigh that.
20933,marwyn,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,The triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankind's curse.
20934,sam,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,"Archmaester, I was wondering..."
20935,marwyn,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,What's the weight?
20936,sam,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,"Um, 147."
20937,sam,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
20938,marwyn,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,I don't remember your proposition.
20939,sam,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,"I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library."
20940,marwyn,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?
20941,sam,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,No.
20942,marwyn,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,"Not a very strong proposition, is it?"
20943,sam,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,"Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
20944,marwyn,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
20945,sam,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,Sources in the restricted area?
20946,marwyn,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
20947,sam,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,"So, you believe me."
20948,marwyn,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?
20949,sam,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
20950,marwyn,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL ARCHMAESTER'S LAB_1,"We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this world's memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--""The end is near! How will we survive?"" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended."

20961,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11,"No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever."

20965,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11,"We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us."
20966,brienne of tarth,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11,He wants something.
20967,sansa stark,7,61,dragonstone,OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY_11,I know exactly what he wants.EXT. RIVERLANDS - FORESTARYA is riding a horse through the forest. She happens upon a group of Lannister soldiers sitting by a fire.

21015,thoros,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,See if there's a larder. They always leave something behind.
21016,beric dondarrion,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,How do you think it ended for them?
21017,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,With death.
21018,beric dondarrion,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,"Girl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them."

21022,beric dondarrion,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--
21023,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,And I always thought you were dull as dirt.
21024,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,"You're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like, but you're not bad."
21025,beric dondarrion,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,"Thank you, Clegane. That warms the heart."
21026,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,But there's nothing special about you.
21027,beric dondarrion,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,You're right about that.
21028,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,"So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?"
21029,beric dondarrion,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
21030,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,And?
21031,beric dondarrion,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,I don't know. I don't understand our Lord.
21032,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,Your Lord.
21033,beric dondarrion,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.
21034,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,"If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?"
21035,thoros,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,Clegane.
21036,thoros,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,Come over here. Don't worry. The fire won't bite. I want to show you something.
21037,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.
21038,beric dondarrion,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.
21039,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,"There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead...and that girl would be alive."

21043,thoros,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?
21044,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.
21045,thoros,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,We can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you.
21046,thoros,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,What do you see?
21047,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,Logs burning.
21048,thoros,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,Keep looking. What do you see?
21049,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.
21050,thoros,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,What else?
21051,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.
21052,sandor clegane,7,61,dragonstone,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY)_1,There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past.

21096,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
21097,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,"Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--"
21098,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,"Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?"
21099,varys,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,"Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful."
21100,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
21101,varys,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,Which you turned to your advantage.
21102,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,Who gave the order to kill me?
21103,varys,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,King Robert.
21104,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,Who hired the assassins?
21105,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
21106,varys,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,"Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--"
21107,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,To keep yourself alive.
21108,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
21109,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,"Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?"
21110,varys,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,"The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you."
21111,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,"Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them."
21112,varys,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,"I swear it, my queen."
21113,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,"And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive."
21114,varys,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
21115,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,Unnamed Scene_93,"Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you."
21116,melisandre,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded.  It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains."
21117,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen.  You are very welcome here.  What is your name?
21118,melisandre,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,I am called Melisandre.
21119,varys,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.  It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?"
21120,melisandre,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"No, it didn't."
21121,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
21122,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.
21123,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"The Lord of Light doesn't have  many followers in Westeros, does he?"
21124,melisandre,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,Not yet.   But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
21125,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,What does your Lord expect from me?
21126,melisandre,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,The Long Night is coming.  Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.
21127,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,The prince who was promised will bring the dawn.  I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
21128,missandei,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate.  That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."
21129,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
21130,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"No, but I like it better."
21131,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
21132,melisandre,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"Prophecies are dangerous things.  I believe you have a role to play, as does another.  The King in the North, Jon Snow."
21133,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,Jon Snow?  Ned Stark's bastard?
21134,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,You know him?
21135,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
21136,varys,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?"
21137,melisandre,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger.  As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
21138,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,He sounds like quite a man.
21139,melisandre,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"Summon Jon Snow.  Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes."
21140,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character."
21141,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,"If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally.  The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother.  Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do."
21142,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_1,Very well.  Send a raven north.  Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
21143,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,Do you think it's really Tyrion?  It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
21144,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,Read the last bit.
21145,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"""All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes.""  What does that mean?"
21146,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,It's something he said to me the first night we met.  You know him better than any of us.  What do you think?
21147,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters.  He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk.  ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.  Join us.  Together we can end her tyranny."""
21148,davos seaworth,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"Sounds like a charmer.  Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming."
21149,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,What?
21150,davos seaworth,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"Fire kills Whites, you told me.  What breathes fire?"
21151,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
21152,davos seaworth,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"No, too dangerous."
21153,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,But?
21154,davos seaworth,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_3,"But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?"
21155,cersei lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it.  Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.  But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown.  With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores.  Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts.  Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought.  This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty."
21156,cersei lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"You all remember the Mad King.  You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.  His daughter is no different.  In Essos her brutality is already legendary.  She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.  And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons."
21157,cersei lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords.  We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her."
21158,randyll tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace.  The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms.  How do you propose to stop them?"
21159,qyburn,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord."
21160,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,Lord Tarley.
21161,randyll tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"Ser, Jaime.  I believe you know my son."
21162,dickon tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"Ser, Jaime."
21163,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"Rickon, isn't it?"
21164,dickon tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,Dickon.
21165,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,That's it.
21166,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,Thank you for coming.  The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever.  They might not have come if you hadn't.
21167,randyll tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"If my queen summons me, I answer the call.  And I've heard what she does to those that defy her."
21168,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,Do you ride for Hornhill today?
21169,randyll tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,I have an army to mobilize.  It won't be long until the fighting starts.
21170,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,And what side will you be fighting for?  You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.  Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
21171,randyll tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime.  How may I serve?"
21172,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.  I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies.  All of her enemies.
21173,randyll tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,Including Olenna Tyrell?  I'm a Tarley.  That name means something.  We're not oath breakers.  We're not schemers.  We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings.   I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
21174,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."
21175,randyll tarly,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,I've known Olenna since I was a child.
21176,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,"She was a great woman, once.  Now she's broken.  She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores.  The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.  I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice.  Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?"
21177,jaime lannister,7,62,stormborn,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM_1,When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south.  I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
21178,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,The infection has spread too far.  You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
21179,jorah mormont,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,How long?
21180,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"It will be years before it kills you.  It could be 10, could be 20."
21181,jorah mormont,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,But how long 'till...
21182,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"Your mind?  Six months, maybe fewer."
21183,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"Pardon, Archmaester.  I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black.  She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured.  Isn't there some way --"
21184,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,Does this look like a baby to you?
21185,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,No.
21186,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
21187,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,No.
21188,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
21189,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser.  Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men.  As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day.  How you choose to spend that time is up to you."
21190,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"Come, Samwell."
21191,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"Should we send word to your family, Ser..."
21192,jorah mormont,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,Jorah.  Jorah Mormont.
21193,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,Mormont?
21194,jorah mormont,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,There's no need.  I've been dead to them for years.
21195,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"Come, Samwell."
21196,qyburn,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?"
21197,cersei lannister,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"No, I can't say I have.  I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room."
21198,qyburn,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
21199,cersei lannister,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,They were his trophies.  He couldn't keep them around.  They would have made him look small.  Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.  I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
21200,qyburn,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"Balerion the Dread.  The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.  Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.  Powerful, but not invincible."
21201,qyburn,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.  If they can be wounded, they can be killed."
21202,qyburn,7,62,stormborn,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace.  If you'd kindly pull that lever."
21203,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"If you want the Iron Throne, take it.  We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons.  We should hit King's Landing now.  Hard.  With everything we have.  The city will fall within a day."
21204,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms."
21205,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"It's called war.  You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding."
21206,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,I know how you wage war.  We don't poison little girls here.  Myrcella was innocent.
21207,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,She was a Lannister.  There are no innocent Lannisters.  My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
21208,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,That's enough.  Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen.  You will treat him with respect.
21209,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
21210,olenna tyrell,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"That's very nice to hear.  Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter.  The common people loved her, the nobles loved her.  And what is left of her now?  Ashes.  Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really.  They won't obey you unless they fear you."
21211,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council.  I'm grateful to all of you.  But you have chosen to follow me.  I will not attack King's Landing.  We will not attack King's Landing."
21212,olenna tyrell,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?  By asking nicely?
21213,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides.  Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
21214,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
21215,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country.  If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.  Our army should be Westerosi."
21216,elia martell,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
21217,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,You are.
21218,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
21219,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army.  Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
21220,olenna tyrell,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"So, your master plan is to use our armies?  Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?"
21221,tyrion lannister,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,The unsullied will have another objective.  For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.  And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.  Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
21222,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Do I have your support?
21223,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,You have mine.
21224,elia martell,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"Dorne is with you, Your Grace."
21225,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"Thank you all.  Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?"
21226,daenerys targaryen,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.  But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
21227,olenna tyrell,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"Peace.  Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his?  Peace never lasts, my dear.  Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?"
21228,olenna tyrell,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"He's a clever man, your Hand.  I've known a great many clever men.  I've outlived them all.  Do you know why?  I ignored them.  The lords of Westeros are sheep.  Are you a sheep?  No.  You're a dragon.  Be a dragon."
21229,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Enter.
21230,missandei,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,You leave tomorrow.  Were you going to say goodbye?
21231,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,I will see you when I return.
21232,missandei,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,But you don't know when that will be.
21233,greyworm,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,No one knows.
21234,missandei,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,I wish you good fortune.
21235,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Missandei --
21236,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
21237,missandei,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Why?
21238,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,You know why.
21239,missandei,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,I don't.
21240,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,You are my weakness.
21241,missandei,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,That's what I am?  Your weakness?
21242,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears.  One boy is scared of dogs.  One boy hates high places.  One is frightened of the ocean.  They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff.  They throw him in the water.  If he learns to swim, good.  If he drowns, good.  Either way, strong Unsullied.  But I had no fears.  I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always."
21243,missandei,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,I believe it.
21244,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth.  Now I have fear.
21245,missandei,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,I do too.
21246,grey worm,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,No.
21247,missandei,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,I want to see you.  Please.
21248,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,It might be useful.  Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.
21249,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"Archmaester, I wanted to --"
21250,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,And this one.
21251,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Maester Faol was quite the opposite.  A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
21252,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,I wanted to ask you --
21253,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research.  If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style.  I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread."
21254,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,What?  You don't like the title?  What would you call it then?
21255,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Possibly something a bit more poetic?
21256,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"We're not poets, Tarley."
21257,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"Archmaester, if I could just have a moment."
21258,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,This is your moment.  Use it wisely.
21259,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.  There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured.  I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.
21260,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.
21261,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,"Oh, you are?"
21262,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Yes.  Should I tell you how he died?  From Greyscale.
21263,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,Oh.
21264,marwyn,7,62,stormborn,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_1,The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.
21265,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,Hello.
21266,jorah mormont,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,What are you doing?
21267,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,You're Jorah Mormont.  You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.
21268,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"My name is Samwell Tarley.  I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black.  I knew your father.  I was with him when he died.  You're not dying today, Ser Jorah."
21269,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,Drink this.
21270,jorah mormont,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,What is it?
21271,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"Rum.  Drink it all, please.  I'm afraid this is going to hurt."
21272,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,If you could take off your shirt.
21273,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.  I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here.  If they hear you screaming then we're both finished."
21274,jorah mormont,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,Have you ever done this before?
21275,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"No.  No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got.  Have a seat.  I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --"
21276,samwell tarly,7,62,stormborn,QUARANTINE ROOMS_1,"Shh,  shhh.  Again, I'm sorry.  Please try not to scream."
21282,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,Ary!
21283,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,"Hello, Hot Pie.  Sit down.  Who's that for?"
21284,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,Mmm.  This is good.
21285,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,You think so?  The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.  Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
21286,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,I didn't do that.
21287,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,You've been making pies?
21288,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,One or two.
21289,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,I can't believe you're here.  Did you meet the big lady?
21290,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,Big lady?
21291,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,The lady knight.  I figured she was a knight because she had armor on.  She was looking for your sister but I told her about you.  Did she ever find you?
21292,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,She found me.
21293,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,What happened to you Ary?
21294,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,You got any ale?
21295,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,Where are you heading?
21296,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,King's Landing.
21297,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,Why?
21298,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,I heard Cersei's queen now.
21299,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,I heard she blew up the Great Sept.  That must have been something to see.  Boom.
21300,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,Hmm.
21301,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,I can't believe someone could do that.
21302,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,Cersei would do that.
21303,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
21304,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,Why would I go there?  The Boltons have it.
21305,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,No.  The Boltons are dead.
21306,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,What?
21307,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards.  He's King in the North now.
21308,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,You're lying.
21309,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,Why would I lie about that?  He's your brother right?
21310,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,Thanks for the pie.
21311,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,Friends don't pay.  I can't believe I thought you were a boy.  You're pretty.
21312,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,Thanks.
21313,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,"Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.  Try not to get killed."
21314,hot pie,7,62,stormborn,INN AT THE CROSSROADS_1,"No, I won't.  I'm like you, Ary.  I'm a survivor."
21315,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - KING'S QUARTERS_1,Come in.
21316,wolkan,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - KING'S QUARTERS_1,"A raven, My King, from the Citadel."
21317,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley.  He was my brother at the Night's Watch.  A man I trust as much as anyone in this world.  He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
21318,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone.  It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
21319,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.  She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.  She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons."
21320,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
21321,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"We need this Dragonglass, My Lords.  We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army.  We need to mine it and turn it into weapons."
21322,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"But more importantly, we need allies.  The Night King's army grows larger by the day.  We can't defeat them on our own.  We don't have the numbers.  Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire.  I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.  Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
21323,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?  The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
21324,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,I know that.
21325,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.  The north is one of those seven kingdoms.  This isn't an invitation, it's a trap."
21326,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that.  You know him.  He's a good man."
21327,yohn royce,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa.  I remember the Mad King all too well.  A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister."
21328,robett glover,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom."
21329,lyanna mormont,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"Winter is here, Your Grace.  We need the King in the North in the north."
21330,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"You all crowned me your king.  I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home.  It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds.  But the odds are against us.  None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.  None of you.  We can never hope to defeat them alone.  We need allies, powerful allies.  I know it's a risk.  But I have to take it."
21331,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,Then send an emissary.  Don't go yourself.
21332,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,Daenerys is a queen.  Only a king can convince her to help us.  It has to be me.
21333,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,You're abandoning your people.  Your abandoning your home.
21334,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,I'm leaving both in good hands.
21335,sansa stark,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,Whose?
21336,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL_1,"Yours.  You are my sister.  You are the only Stark in Winterfell.  Until I return, the north is yours."
21337,petyr baelish,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT_1,I delivered his bones myself.  I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.  It seems like a lifetime ago.  Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
21338,petyr baelish,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT_1,"I was sorry when he died.  Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much.  So did I.  She wasn't fond of you, was she?  Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.  Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North.  Last best hope against the coming storm."
21339,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT_1,You don't belong down here.
21340,petyr baelish,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT_1,Forgive me.  We have never talked properly.  I wanted to remedy that.
21341,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT_1,I have nothing to say to you.
21342,petyr baelish,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT_1,"Not even thank you?  If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield.  You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them.  I love Sansa as I loved her mother."
21343,jon snow,7,62,stormborn,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT_1,Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
21344,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,RIVERLANDS_9,Nymeria?
21345,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,RIVERLANDS_9,"Nymeria, it's me, Arya.  I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell.  I'm finally going home.  Come with me."
21346,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,RIVERLANDS_9,Come with me.
21347,arya stark,7,62,stormborn,RIVERLANDS_9,That's not you.
21348,nymeria,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,You can't have them all.  It's not fair.
21349,obara sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,I'm oldest.
21350,tyene sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,Momma will want Cersei for herself.
21351,obara sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,She's not my momma.  You can have Cersei.  I want The Mountain.
21352,nymeria,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,The Mountain killed father.  He'll crush you with one hand.
21353,tyene sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,Father got careless.  That's what Momma says.
21354,obara sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,"Will you shut up about Momma?  Momma, momma."
21355,tyene sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP_1,Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.
21356,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"How can you drink this piss?  When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world.  Have you ever been to Dorne?"
21357,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,A few times.  Never stayed long.
21358,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,A boy in every port?
21359,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"A boy, a girl.  Depends on the port."
21360,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,Could we get some more?
21361,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,I thought it wasn't for you.
21362,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,I'm developing a taste for it.
21363,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,He's not your servant.
21364,theon greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,It's fine.
21365,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands."
21366,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,Once I kill my uncle.
21367,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"And what will you be, handsome?"
21368,theon greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,Whatever my queen demands.
21369,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"He'll be my advisor, my protector."

21371,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,So if someone gets too close to you --
21372,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,He might have to intervene.
21373,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,-- hold that person back.
21374,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,Until they've made their intentions known.
21375,ellaria sand,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,Why are you standing all the way over there then?  A foreign invasion is under way.  It seems like you don't need a protector.
21376,yara greyjoy,7,62,stormborn,SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,Stay here.

21407,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,Good.  At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
21408,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
21409,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"A long and bloody tale.  To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
21410,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
21411,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"Of course they do.  If I was your hand I would have advised against it.  General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south."
21412,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,True.  But I'm not a Stark.
21413,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do."
21414,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,Come.  Their mother is waiting for you.
21415,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests.  You begged us to summon the King in the North.  Don't you want to see him again?
21416,melisandre,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,I've done my part.  I've brought ice and fire together.
21417,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,Strange.  You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff.  I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
21418,melisandre,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.
21419,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"Oh, I doubt that.  Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man.  Nothing is ever so sweet again."
21420,melisandre,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"Neither of us is common folk anymore.  I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor."
21421,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,Why?
21422,melisandre,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,Because of mistakes I made.  Terrible mistakes.  I would only be a distraction if I stayed.
21423,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,So where will you go?
21424,melisandre,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,Volantis.
21425,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"Good.  If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros.  I'm not sure you'd be safe here."
21426,melisandre,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"I will return, dear spider.  One last time."
21427,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,My Lady --
21428,melisandre,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY_1,"I have to die in this strange country, just like you."
21429,missandei,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains."
21430,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,This is Jon Snow.
21431,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,He's King in the North.
21432,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords.  I hope the seas weren't too rough."
21433,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"The winds were kind, Your Grace."
21434,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"Apologies.  I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know.  But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace.  He's not a lord."
21435,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,Forgive me --
21436,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."
21437,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"Forgive me, Ser Davos.  I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen.  Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity.  But do I have my facts wrong?"
21438,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"I wasn't there, Your Grace."
21439,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"No.  Of course not.  But still, an oath is an oath.  In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?"
21440,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,Forever.
21441,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"Forever.  So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee."
21442,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,I am not.
21443,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"Oh.  Well, that is unfortunate.  You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?"
21444,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,Break faith?  Your father burned my grandfather alive.  He burned my uncle alive.  He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
21445,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"My father was an evil man.  On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family.  And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father.  Our two houses were allies for centuries.  Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known.  Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.  I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.  Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.  Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.  Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
21446,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,You're right.  You're not guilty of your father's crime.  And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
21447,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,Then why are you here?
21448,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,Because I need your help and you need mine.
21449,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
21450,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,I did.
21451,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?"
21452,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,They're hard to miss.
21453,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"But still, I need your help?"
21454,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"Not to defeat Cersei.  You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.  Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."
21455,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,Almost.
21456,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,But you haven't stormed King's Landing.  Why not?  The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.  It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it.  Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
21457,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
21458,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair."
21459,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,You told me you liked this man.
21460,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,I do.
21461,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child."
21462,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,I believe he's calling all of us children.  Figure of speech.
21463,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north."
21464,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north."
21465,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,I am not your enemy.  The dead are the enemy.
21466,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,The dead?
21467,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,Is that another figure of speech?
21468,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,The Army of the Dead is on the march.
21469,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,The Army of the Dead?
21470,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
21471,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"No, I don't think you're either of those things."
21472,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,The Army of the Dead is real.  The White Walkers are real.  The Knight King is real.  I've seen them.  If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --
21473,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,-- we're finished.
21474,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,I was born at Dragonstone.  Not that I can remember it.
21475,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.  Robert was your father's best friend, no?  I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib.  Not that it matters now of course.  I spent my life in foreign lands.  So many men have tried to kill me.  I don't remember all of their names.  I have been sold like a brood mare.  I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled.  Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile?  Faith.  Not in any gods.  Not in myths and legends.  In myself.  In Daenerys Targaryen.  The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born.  The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea.  Any sea."
21476,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,They did for me.  I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.  And I will.
21477,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.
21478,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,The war against my sister has already begun.  You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --
21479,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,-- whatever you saw beyond the wall.
21480,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,You don't believe him.  I understand that.  It sounds like nonsense.
21481,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.  You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros.  He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen.  He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.  He was named King in the North.  Not because of his birthright.  He has no birthright.  He's a damn bastard.  All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him."
21482,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things.  He fought those things for the good of his people.  He risked his life for his people.  He took a knife in the heart for his people.  He gave his own --"
21483,davos seaworth,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die.  And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
21484,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.
21485,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys.  Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.
21486,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,There's no time for that.  There's no time for any of this.  While we stand here debating --
21487,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,It takes no time to bend the knee.  Pledge your sword to her cause.
21488,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,And why would I do that?
21489,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you.  As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name.  And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.  The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them.  And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
21490,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,"That's fair.  It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion."
21491,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,You must forgive my manners.  You will both be tired after your long journey.  We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
21492,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,Am I your prisoner?
21493,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,Not yet.
21494,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.
21495,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,And?
21496,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,Two or three ships escaped.  The rest sunk our captured.  Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured.  The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
21497,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_3,All of them?
21499,theon greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,SEA OF DORNE_5,Euron has her.
21501,theon greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,SEA OF DORNE_5,I couldn't save her.  I tried.
21503,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,KING'S LANDING - STREETS_1,This is the life.  Look at them.  Cheering for a Greyjoy.
21504,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,KING'S LANDING - STREETS_1,"I have to be honest, it's making me hard.  Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?"
21505,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,KING'S LANDING - STREETS_1,Oh no!
21506,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,KING'S LANDING - STREETS_1,What a twat.
21507,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,My queen.  Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.
21508,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,I give you --
21509,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,-- what no other man could give.  Justice.  Justice for your murdered daughter.
21510,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.
21511,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,A bit more than a true friend.
21512,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
21513,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,There's only one reward I want.
21514,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,You shall have what your heart desires --
21515,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,-- when the war is won.
21516,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,"With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country."
21517,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,"There's nothing quite like it, is there?  The love of the people.  I suppose you wouldn't know."
21518,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,"This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
21519,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,"Or yours.  They just like severed heads really.  Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers."
21520,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,Advice?
21521,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,Does she like it gentle or rough?  A finger in the bum?
21522,euron greyjoy,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM_5,"Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now.  We'll talk later."
21523,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"I want you to know I understand.  Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you.  I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head.  I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking."
21524,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"The sound of your scream.  I never heard a sound like that.  I thought, that's true love.  Oberyn looked beautiful that day.  He really did.  No one moved like him.  No one had such skill with a spear.  Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.  If only he hadn't taunted him.  He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.  But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?  Now he's burried somewhere.  And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever.  That must be difficult for you.  When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child.  I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse.  I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms.  I never got to have a mother.  But Myrcella did.  She was mine and you took her from me.  Why did you do that?"
21525,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,It doesn't matter now.
21526,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"Your daughter is a beauty too.  Brown eyes, those lips.  A perfect Dornish beauty."
21527,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,I imagine she is your favorite.
21528,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites.  But still, we're only human.  We love who we love."
21529,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,I'm sorry.  I can't understand you.  The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying.  It must be frustrating.
21530,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,We all make our choices.  You chose to murder my daughter.  You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
21531,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"Do you feel powerful now?  I don't sleep very well, not at all really.  I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies.  How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter.  I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's.  It would be poetic I suppose but fast.  Too fast."
21532,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
21533,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"She's so beautiful.  The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right."
21534,tyene sand,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,Momma!
21535,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know.  Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.  The long goodbye, was that it?"
21536,qyburn,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,The Long Farewell.
21537,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,That's the one.
21538,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,How long does the poison take?
21539,qyburn,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"Difficult to say.  Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution."
21540,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,But death is certain?
21541,qyburn,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain."
21542,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"Your daughter will die here in this cell.  You will be here watching when she does.  You will be here the rest of your days.  If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat.  You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made."
21543,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - DUNGEONS_1,Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.  I don't want her to miss a thing.
21544,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS_1,No.
21545,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS_1,Don't.
21546,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS_1,What are you doing?  No one can see us like this ?
21547,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS_1,I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  I'll do as I please.
21549,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS_1,Good.  And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
21551,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"No, thank you."
21552,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son.  From all reports he was a fine young man."
21553,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.
21554,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,Condolences and congratulations.  You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms.  That's quite an accomplishment.  The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.
21555,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
21556,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,Indeed.  But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.
21557,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
21558,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"Your father never minced words either.  But, yes, your debts are considerable.  And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts.  We both know how expensive war can be."
21559,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,And we both know gold wins wars.  Your vaults are empty.  Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.
21560,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies.  You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
21561,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
21562,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,We don't make bets.  We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
21563,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,That's a fancy way of saying bet.  The war has already begun.  I've drawn first blood.  I decapitated the Dornish snake.  My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
21564,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
21565,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
21566,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,For now.  Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons.  How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
21567,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.  Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl.  You want to invest in her?  I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade.  How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
21568,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true."
21569,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch.  In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
21570,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts.  Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
21571,tycho nestoris,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,Your father's daughter indeed.
21572,cersei lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,Give me a fortnight.  Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.
21573,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.  You're making it difficult.  You look a lot better brooding than I do.  You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
21574,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,I'm a prisoner on this island.
21575,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.  You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
21576,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,Except to my ship.  They took my ship.
21577,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,I wouldn't say we took your ship.
21578,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,I'm not playing word games with you.  The dead are coming for us all.
21579,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
21580,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,It's hard for me to fathom.  It really is.  If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
21581,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,You probably don't believe me.
21582,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,I do actually.
21583,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,You didn't before.  Grumpkins and snarks you called them.  Do you remember?  You said it was all nonsense.
21584,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"It was all nonsense.  Everybody knew it.  But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
21585,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
21586,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,Good question.
21587,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,I know it's a good question.  I'm looking for an answer.
21588,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"People's minds aren't made for problems that large.  White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
21589,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.  I can't help them from here.  I'd like to leave.
21590,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
21591,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.  Don't go south.  Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader.  And here I am.  A northern fool."
21592,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us.  And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye.  Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't.  Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now.  While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter.  She protects people from monsters, just as you do.  That's why she came here.  And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting.  That's not a reasonable thing to ask."
21593,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,So do you have anything reasonable to ask?
21594,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,What do you mean?
21595,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,Maybe you are a northern fool.  I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
21596,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,Dragonglass?
21597,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,"Yes.  Volcanic glass, obsidian.  He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
21598,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,Why are we talking about glass?  We just lost two of our allies.
21599,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,"Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
21600,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
21601,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,"Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them.  I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
21602,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
21603,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,"I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
21604,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,Which wise man said this?
21605,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,I don't remember.
21606,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
21607,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,"I would never do that...to you.  The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.  All of his advisors would have told him not to come.  I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway.  You don't have to believe him.  Let him mine the Dragonglass.  If he's wrong it's worthless.  You didn't even know it was here.  It's nothing to you.  Give him something by giving him nothing.  Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally.  Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand.  Casterly Rock."
21608,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people?  Did you notice that?
21609,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_3,You must allow them their flights of fancy.  It's dreary in the north.
21610,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,Amazing thing to see.
21611,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.
21612,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,You lost two brothers as well?
21613,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are.  Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
21614,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,You've been talking to Tyrion?
21615,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,He is my Hand.
21616,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,He enjoys talking.
21617,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,We all enjoy what we're good at.
21618,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,I don't.
21619,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
21620,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,I never expected that you would.
21621,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
21622,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,I haven't either.
21623,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it.  Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
21624,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,Thank you.
21625,jon snow,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
21626,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS_1,"You better get to work, Jon Snow."
21627,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,How much do we have?
21628,wolkan,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"4,000 bushels, My Lady."
21629,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,What does that mean?
21630,yohn royce,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more."
21631,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
21632,wolkan,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,I'm not entirely certain.  I'll check Maester Llewyn's records.  He kept a copy of every raven scroll.
21633,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell."
21634,wolkan,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"No, My Lady, most likely not."
21635,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"We must prepare for that eventuality.  Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be.  We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north.  If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them."
21636,yohn royce,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"Very wise, My Lady."
21637,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?"
21638,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
21639,yohn royce,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"No, My Lady."
21640,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?"
21641,yohn royce,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"They should indeed.  Pardon me, My Lady."
21642,yohn royce,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"You there, why isn't there leather on these?"
21643,petyr baelish,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,Command suits you.  The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
21644,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,So they should be.
21645,petyr baelish,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,I know Cersei better than anyone here.  If you turn your back on her --
21646,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
21647,petyr baelish,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,I only meant to say --
21648,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous?  Thank you for your wise council."
21649,petyr baelish,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"One of two things will happen.  Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end.  Or life will win out.  And what then?"
21650,petyr baelish,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"Don't fight in the north or the south.  Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind.  Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once.  Live that way and nothing will surprise you.  Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."
21652,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_7,"Hello, Sansa."
21653,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,I wish Jon was here.
21654,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,Yes.  I need to speak to him.
21655,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,Your father's last living true born son.  You're Lord of Winterfell.
21656,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,I can never be the Lord of Winterfell.  I can never be lord of anything.  I'm the three-eyed raven.
21657,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,I don't know what that means.
21658,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,It's difficult to explain.
21659,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,"Try, please, for me."
21660,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,"It means I can see everything.  Everything that's ever happened to everyone.  Everything that's happening right now.  It's all pieces, fragments.  I need to learn to see better.  When the long night comes again I need to be ready."
21661,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,How do you know all of this?
21662,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,The three-eyed raven taught me.
21663,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,I thought you were the three-eyed raven.
21664,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,I told you it's difficult to explain.
21665,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,Bran --
21666,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.  I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home.  It was so beautiful that night.  Snow falling just like now.  And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.
21667,sansa stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,"I have to go back inside, Bran."
21668,bran stark,7,63,the queen's justice,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_1,I'll stay a bit longer.
21669,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,Hmm.
21670,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,Hmm.  Does it hurt?
21671,jorah mormont,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,A bit.  Less than before.
21672,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,The infection no longer appears to be active.
21673,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,Unusual.  Unlikely.  One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.
21674,jorah mormont,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,I don't know anything about that.  I just started feeling better.  I assumed it was the rest that did it.
21675,jorah mormont,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,And the climate.
21676,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,"The climate?  You're free to go, Ser.  This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer."
21677,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,"Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening."
21678,jorah mormont,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,How bad is it?
21679,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,I suppose I'll find out this evening.
21680,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,Where will you go?
21681,jorah mormont,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.  I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could.  Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.  The only place for me is with her.
21682,jorah mormont,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,I owe my life to her and you.
21683,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,Your father saved me more than once.  It's the least I could do.
21684,jorah mormont,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,Perhaps our paths will cross again?
21685,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS_3,I hope they do.
21686,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,You treated him?
21687,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,Yes.
21688,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,Who told you to treat him?
21689,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,No one.
21690,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
21691,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,I seem to remember you.
21692,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,But you treated him anyway?
21693,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,I did.
21694,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,"I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful.  Especially on someone of that age.  You could have infected yourself and others.  You could have devastated the entire Citadel.  But you didn't.  It's a meticulous, difficult procedure.  Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed.  But you succeeded.  How?"
21695,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,I read the books and followed the instructions.
21696,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,That man is alive because of you.  You should be proud.
21697,samwell tarly,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,"Thank you, Archmaester."
21698,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,Come here.
21699,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away.  I need you to make copies of them.
21700,marwyn,7,63,the queen's justice,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY_1,You were expecting a reward?  Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.  You'd better get started.  Be mindful of the paper mites.  They like flesh as well.
21701,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
21702,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,"Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet.  To send our remaining ships after him --"
21703,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
21704,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,But you'll have to go yourself.  Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place.  You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
21705,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,"I wouldn't be alone.  I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal.  What can anyone do to them?"
21706,missandei,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,They can still do something to you.  It only takes one arrow.
21707,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,It's too great a risk.  You're too important.
21708,daenerys targaryen,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,What about Casterly Rock?
21709,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,The Unsullied will be there soon.
21710,missandei,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,And what will they face?
21711,varys,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,A difficult situation.  They know we're coming.
21712,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_5,Yes.  Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister.  She will be ready.
21713,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK_1,No one has ever taken the rock.
21714,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK_1,"The Lannister army is still the army my father built.  Well trained and well provisioned.  10,000 men at least.  They will see us coming."
21715,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK_1,They will be ready.
21717,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK_1,The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
21718,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK_1,The fight up the walls will be hard.  We'll be at a disadvantage.  Many men will die.
21719,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_7,"Interesting thing about my father.  He built our house up from near ruin.  He built our army.  He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers.  That was beneath him.  So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find.  Me.  He was right.  I was low.  The company I kept low, women mostly.  They weren't welcome at the Rock.  Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.  I couldn't walk them through the front gates.  I couldn't have them in my chambers.  So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself."
21720,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
21721,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,"No better place for low pursuits.  Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress."
21722,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,"As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."""
21723,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,And so it begins.  They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.  They will be outnumbered.  They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
21724,tyrion lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,"But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.  They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them.  They will be fighting for you.  And that is why they will triump."
21726,grey worm,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,There are supposed to be more than this.  Many more.
21727,grey worm,7,63,the queen's justice,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS_1,Where are they?  Where are the rest of the Lannisters?
21728,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,It's done?
21729,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,It is.
21730,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,And now the rains weep for our whores.  Did we fight well?
21731,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,I suppose as well as can be expected.
21732,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,It was never our forte.  Golden roses indeed.  Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
21733,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.  Well, it is to me.  My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne."
21734,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,So you'll just let them take it?
21735,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"For now.  They won't be able to hold it.  Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left.  Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros."
21736,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?"
21737,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.  There are always lessons in failures.
21738,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,Yes.  You must be very wise by now.
21739,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,My father always said I was a slow learner.
21740,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry?  I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.  No more learning from my mistakes, eh?  How will you do it?  With that sword?"
21741,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?  Not that he ever used it.  What did he call it?"
21742,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,Widow's Wail.
21743,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"He really was a cunt, wasn't he?  I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders.  I never lost a night's sleep over them.  They were necessary.  And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did.  But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining.  That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination.  She's a monster, you do know that?"
21744,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"To you, sure.  To others as well.  But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
21745,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,You love her.  You really do love her.  You poor fool.  She'll be the end of you.
21746,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"Possibly.  Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?"
21747,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,What better person to discuss it with?  What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room?  But perhaps you're right.  If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
21748,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"Yes, it has."
21749,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,She's a disease.  I regret my role in spreading it.  You will too.
21750,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,I think we're done here.
21751,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,How will it happen?
21752,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,Cersei had several ideas.  Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.  Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.  I talked her out of those.
21753,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,Will there be pain?
21754,jaime lannister,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,No.  I made sure of that.
21755,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,That's good.
21756,olenna tyrell,7,63,the queen's justice,OLENNA'S QUARTERS_1,"I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple.  It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father.  It was horrible enough for me.  A shocking scene.  Not at all what I intended.  You see, I'd never seen the posion work before.  Tell Cersei.  I want her to know it was me."
21757,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,Halt that wagon!
21758,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,You just won the biggest prize in the world.  What could you possibly have to be upset about?  Come on.  You can tell me.  Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
21759,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
21760,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,There is no more High Septon.
21761,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,"No, there isn't, is there?"
21762,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,There is still the question of my prize.
21763,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,That's a lot of money I just gave you.
21764,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,It's not a castle.
21765,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,How about that one?  It's available.
21766,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,You don't want Highgarden.
21767,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,I beg to differ.
21768,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,"We're at war.  Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in.  Besides, think of the upkeep.  The more you own, the more it weighs you down."
21769,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,"Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?  All your new riches weighing you down?"
21770,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,They're not mine.  The gold belongs to the Iron Bank.  We pay our debts.
21771,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,Right.  Just not to me.
21772,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,"Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid.  When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you."
21773,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,"Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful."
21774,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,Stranger things have happened.
21775,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,Like what?
21776,randyll tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,"The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord."
21777,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,The current harvest?
21778,dickon tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.
21779,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,"Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?"
21780,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,I'm not much for shoveling weight.
21781,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,"No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that."
21782,randyll tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,My Lord.
21783,dickon tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,Unnamed Scene_95,My Lord.
21784,tycho nestoris,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment.  I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely."
21785,cersei lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"You're too kind, My Lord."
21786,tycho nestoris,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace.  I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment.  And the current arithmetic is outstanding.  The gold --"
21787,cersei lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,Is on its way.  My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
21788,tycho nestoris,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.  They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
21789,cersei lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
21790,tycho nestoris,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,Yes.  Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.
21791,cersei lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
21792,tycho nestoris,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,I see a great deal of potential in that venture.  I imagine that it would require outside investment?
21793,cersei lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"It will indeed.  I need to expand my armies, my navies.  My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
21794,tycho nestoris,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,I know them well.  They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
21795,cersei lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,That's good to hear.  I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
21796,tycho nestoris,7,64,the spoils of war,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM_1,"Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives."
21797,petyr baelish,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,This is for you.
21798,petyr baelish,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off."
21799,petyr baelish,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have.  I wasn't there for her when she needed me most.  But I am here for her now.  To do what she would have done, to protect her children.  Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask."
21800,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,Do you know who this belonged to?
21801,petyr baelish,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"No.  That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.  In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.  Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.  I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe."
21802,petyr baelish,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --"
21803,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,Chaos is a ladder.
21804,petyr baelish,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark."
21805,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,I'm not Lord Stark.
21806,meera reed,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,What's that?
21807,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.
21808,meera reed,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,It's a very good idea.
21809,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,You're leaving?
21810,meera reed,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"I don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family.  And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now.  You don't need me anymore."
21811,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"No, I don't."
21812,meera reed,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,That's all you've got to say?
21813,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,Thank you.
21814,meera reed,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,Thank you?
21815,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,For helping me.
21816,meera reed,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,My brother died for you.  Hodor and Summer died for you.  I almost died for you.  Bran!
21817,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,"I'm not really, not anymore.  I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now."
21818,meera reed,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS_1,You died in that cave.
21820,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,In there.  I live here.
21822,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,I'm Arya Stark.  This is my home.
21824,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick.  They'll tell you who I am.
21827,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,"Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North.  He's my brother"
21831,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
21833,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,Which Lady Stark?
21835,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,Tell Sansa her sister is home.
21837,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE_1,"I'm getting into this castle one way or another.  If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long.  But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away..."
21847,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,You don't have to.  I know where she is.
21848,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?
21849,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,Yes.
21850,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,You shouldn't have run from the guards.
21851,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,I didn't run.  You need better guards.
21852,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,"It suits you, Lady Stark.  Jon left you in charge?"
21853,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,"He did.  I hope he comes back soon.  I remember how happy he was to see me.  When he sees you, his heart will probably stop."
21854,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,That doesn't look like him.  It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
21855,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,Everyone who knew his face is dead.
21856,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,We're not.
21857,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,They say you killed Joffrey.  Did you?
21858,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,I wish I had.
21859,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,Me too.  I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.  However long my list got he was always first.
21860,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,Your list?
21861,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,Of people I'm going to kill.
21862,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,How did you get back to Winterfell?
21863,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,It's a long story.  I imagine yours is too.
21864,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,Yes.  It's not a very pleasant one.
21865,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,"Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet."
21866,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,"No, they're not."
21867,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS_1,"Arya, Bran's home too."
21868,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,You came home.
21869,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,I saw you at the crossroads.
21870,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,You saw me?
21871,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,I see quite a lot now.
21872,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,Bran has visions.
21873,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,I thought you might go to King's Landing.
21874,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,So did I.
21875,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,Why would you go back there?
21876,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,Cersei is on her list of names.
21877,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,Who else is on your list?
21878,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,Most of them are dead already.
21879,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,Where did you get this?
21880,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,Littlefinger gave it to me.
21881,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,"Littlefinger, he's here?"
21882,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,He's declared for House Stark.
21883,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,Why would he give you a dagger?
21884,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,He thought I'd want it.
21885,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,Why?
21886,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,Because it was meant to kill me.
21887,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,The cutthroat after your fall?
21888,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
21889,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
21890,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,He's not a generous man.  He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.
21891,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,It doesn't matter.
21892,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,What do you mean it doesn't matter?
21893,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,I don't want it.
21894,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,Are you sure?  It's Valyrian steel.
21895,bran stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_3,It's wasted on a cripple.
21896,podrick payne,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - GATE_1,Catelyn Stark would be proud.  You kept your vow.
21897,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - GATE_1,I did next to nothing.
21898,podrick payne,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - GATE_1,"You're too hard on yourself, My Lady."
21899,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - GATE_1,I'm not a --
21900,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - GATE_1,"Thank you, Podrick."
21901,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,"Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied."
21902,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,Soon.  They will come back to me.
21903,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,He better.
21904,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,What happened?
21905,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,Many things.
21906,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,Many things?
21907,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,Your Grace.
21908,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,It's all right.
21909,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.
21910,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,"So this is it, all we'll ever need."
21911,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,"There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace."
21912,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,The Children of the Forest made these.
21913,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,When?
21914,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,A very long time ago.
21915,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.  Maybe even before there were men.
21916,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,No.
21917,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,They were here together the Children and the First Men.
21918,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,Doing what?  Fighting each other?
21919,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,"They fought together against their common enemy.  Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together.  We need to do the same if we're going to survive."
21920,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,Because the enemy is real.  It's always been real.
21921,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
21922,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,"No, I don't think I can."
21923,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,I will fight for you.  I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
21924,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,"My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered."
21925,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,They will if their king does.  They chose you to lead them.  They chose you to protect them.  Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
21926,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,What is it?
21927,tyrion lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,We took Casterly Rock.
21928,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,That's very good to hear.
21929,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_11,Isn't it?
21930,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.  Perhaps --
21931,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,You will stay.  All my allies are gone.  They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
21932,tyrion lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,We still have the largest army.
21933,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
21934,tyrion lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.  We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.  Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.  We have a plan.  It's still the right plan.
21935,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"The right plan?  Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach."
21936,tyrion lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,If I've underestimated our enemies --
21937,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"Our enemies?  Your family, you mean.  Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all."
21938,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,Enough with the clever plans.
21939,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,I have three large dragons.  I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
21940,tyrion lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,We've discussed this.
21941,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,My enemies are in the Red Keep.  What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
21942,tyrion lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,A smart one.
21943,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,What do you think I should do?
21944,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,I would never presume to --
21945,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,I'm at war.  I'm losing.
21946,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,What do you think I should do?
21947,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,I never thought that dragons would exist again.  No one did.  The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen.  Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen.  Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
21948,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_3,"But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different.  You're just more of the same."
21949,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,Don't lunge.
21950,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,Don't go where your enemy leads you.
21951,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,Up.
21952,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,And don't --
21953,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
21954,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,Nice sword.  Very nice dagger.
21955,sansa stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --
21956,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,It's been awhile since I've trained.
21957,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,"I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady."
21958,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,He didn't beat the hound.  You did.  I want to train with you.
21959,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,"You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?"
21960,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,"Move aside, Podrick."
21961,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,"You can't use that, My Lady.  It's too small."
21962,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,I won't cut you.  Don't worry.
21963,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,I'll try not to.
21964,brienne of tarth,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,Who taught you to do that?
21965,arya stark,7,64,the spoils of war,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_9,No one.
21966,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,What do you think of her?
21967,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,Who?
21968,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,I believe you know of whom I speak.
21969,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,I think she has a good heart.
21970,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,A good heart?  I've noticed you starring at that good heart.
21971,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"There's no time for that.  I saw the Night King, Davos.  I looked into his eyes.  How many men do we have in the north to fight him?  10,000?  Less?"
21972,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,Fewer.
21973,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,What?
21974,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth."
21975,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"Ser Davos, Lord Snow."
21976,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"King Snow, isn't it?  No?  That doesn't sound right.  King Jon?"
21977,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,It doesn't matter.
21978,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"Forgive me, but may I ask a question?"
21979,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,Of course.
21980,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?"
21981,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,I'm a bastard.  My mother and father weren't married.
21982,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,Is the custom different in Naarth?
21983,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
21984,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,The sounds liberating.
21985,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,Why did you leave your homeland?
21986,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,I was stolen away by slavers.
21987,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,I'm sorry.
21988,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?"
21989,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,She bought me from my master and set me free.
21990,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"That was good of her.  Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?"
21991,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.  Because I believe in her.
21992,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --
21993,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.
21994,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,You believe that?
21995,missandei,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,"I know it.  All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her.  She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew.  She's the queen we chose."
21996,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,You'll forgive me if I switch sides.
21997,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE_13,Is that a Greyjoy ship?
21998,theon greyjoy,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,Jon.  I didn't know you were here.
21999,theon greyjoy,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,"Sansa, is she all right?"
22000,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.
22001,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.  We thought you were dead.
22002,theon greyjoy,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,I should be.
22003,davos seaworth,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,Your sister?
22004,theon greyjoy,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,Euron has her.  I came to ask the queen to help get her back.
22005,jon snow,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,The queen is gone.
22006,theon greyjoy,7,64,the spoils of war,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_5,Where did she go?
22007,randyll tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,All of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.
22008,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,Good.
22009,randyll tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,"We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall.  If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time."
22010,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,We are stretched a bit thin.
22011,randyll tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,"With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility."
22012,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,Let's give them fair warning first.  These men fought well at Highgarden.
22013,dickon tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,Ser Jaime.
22014,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,Rickon.
22015,dickon tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,Dickon.
22016,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.  Your first battle?
22017,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,And?
22018,dickon tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,It was glorious.
22019,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,Come on.  Your father's not here.
22020,dickon tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,All my life we've been pledged to House Tyrell.  I knew some of those men.  I hunted with them.
22021,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,They didn't deserve to die.  But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl.  So here we are.
22022,dickon tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,I didn't expect it to smell like that.
22023,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,Men shit themselves when they die.  Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?
22024,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,"Well, I learned it when I was 5."
22025,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,What?
22026,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,Listen.

22030,randyll tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,"Come on, lads.  Not those wagons.  Fall in line.  Fall in line."
22031,randyll tarly,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,Spears armed!
22032,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,Get back to King's Landing.
22033,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,I'm not abandoning my army.
22034,bronn,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,"You're a commander, not a damned infantryman.  These fuckers are about to swamp us."
22035,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,We can hold them off.
22036,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,Dracarys!
22037,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,Hold the line!

22044,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,I can't shoot with one hand.
22045,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,Come on!

22050,daenerys targaryen,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,Dracarys!
22051,tyrion lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,"Flee, you idiot!"
22052,jaime lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,"Come on, boy.  Come on!"
22053,tyrion lannister,7,64,the spoils of war,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS_1,You fucking idiot.
22054,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_96,You could have killed me.
22055,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_96,What the fuck were you doing back there?
22056,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_96,Ending the war by killing her.
22057,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_96,You saw the dragon between you and her?
22058,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_96,And?
22059,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_96,"Listen to me, cunt.  Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you.  You don't get to kill you.  Only I get to kill you."
22060,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_96,"That was only one of them.  She has two more.  If she decides to use them, to really use them --"
22061,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_96,You're fucked.
22062,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_96,Don't you mean we're fucked?
22063,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_96,"No, I do not.  Dragons are where our partnership ends.  I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing."
22064,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_96,I have to tell Cersei.
22065,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,Unnamed Scene_96,Best well jump back in that river.
22066,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --"
22067,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"-- burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children.  That's Cersei Lannister, not me.  I'm not here to murder.  And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world.  I offer you a choice.  Bend the knee and join me.  Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die."
22068,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"Step forward, My Lord."
22069,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,You will not kneel?
22070,randyll tarly,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,I already have a queen.
22071,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time.  So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible."
22072,randyll tarly,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"There are no easy choices in war.  Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life.  You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader.  One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back."
22073,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,You will not trade your honor for your life.  I respect that.
22074,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace.  Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier.  He would be invaluable at the Wall."
22075,randyll tarly,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,You cannot send me to the Wall.  You are not my queen.
22076,dickon tarly,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,You will have to kill me too.
22077,randyll tarly,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,Step back and shut your mouth.
22078,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,Who are you?
22079,randyll tarly,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,A stupid boy.
22080,dickon tarly,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley."
22081,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,You are the future of your house.  This war has already wiped one great house from the world.  Don't let it happen again.  Bend the knee.
22082,dickon tarly,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,I will not.
22083,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell."
22084,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,I meant what I said.  I'm not here to put men in chains.  If that becomes an option many will take it.  I gave them a choice.  They made it.
22085,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
22086,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,I'm not beheading anyone.
22087,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,Your Grace --
22088,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,"Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die."
22089,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND_1,Dracarys.
22090,qyburn,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,My Lord.
22091,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,How many men did we lose?
22092,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,We haven't done a full counting.
22093,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,"It's armies that win wars.  We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us.  We can buy mercenaries."
22094,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,"They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be."
22095,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,"I just saw the Dothraki fight.  They'll beat any mercenary army.  They'll beat any army I've ever seen.  Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.  Her dragon burned a thousand wagons.  Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.  They couldn't stop it.  And she has three of them.  This isn't a war we can win."
22096,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,"So what do we do?  Sue for peace?  I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered.  And in her mind she's winning.  What sort of offer do you think she'd make?"
22097,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
22098,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,He didn't.
22099,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,"You saw the crossbow, you saw his body."
22100,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,I'm not talking about father.  Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.  He had nothing to do with it.
22101,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,After all this time it still amazes me --
22102,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,It was Olenna.  She confessed before she died.
22103,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
22104,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,After.
22105,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,And you believed her?
22106,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen?  Which one would Margerey been better able to control?  Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?  She was telling the truth.
22107,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,I shouldn't have listened to you.  She should have died screaming.
22108,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,"She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house.  And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them."
22109,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY_1,So we fight and die or we submit and die.  I know my choice.  A soldier should know his.
22110,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
22111,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are.  Gorgeous beasts."
22112,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"They're not beasts to me.  No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children."
22113,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,You weren't gone long.
22114,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,No.
22115,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,And?
22116,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
22117,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,You're not sure how you feel about that?
22118,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"No, I'm not."
22119,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
22120,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,Thousands.
22121,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,We both want to help people.  We can only help them from a position of strength.  Sometimes strength is terrible.  When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
22122,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,Ser Davos gets carried away.
22123,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,So it was a figure of speech?
22125,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,He is my friend.
22126,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,Your Grace.
22127,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend."
22128,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,I served with your father.  He was a great man.
22129,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,You look strong.  You found a cure?
22130,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,"I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.  I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
22131,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS_1,It would be my honor.
22132,bran stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE_5,Ravens.  We need to send ravens.
22134,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,I remember Wolkan.   A bit timid but a sharp mind.
22137,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,It is a bit much.  Still we ought to --
22138,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Brandon Stark --
22139,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,-- the crippled boy.
22140,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Do you know him?
22141,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,I let him through the Wall years ago.  I saw him go beyond the wall.
22142,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,And?
22143,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could.  Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one.  Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say."
22145,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.
22146,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.  If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it.  If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it.  And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good."
22147,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,It could be done.  And this news could be authentic.  It's possible.  It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.
22149,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"Archmaester, please.  It's real.  I've seen it."
22150,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification.  I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
22151,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Archmaester --
22152,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,"That will be all, Tarley."
22156,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,I'm afraid so.
22158,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,I don't have the heart to tell him yet.  He's a good lad.
22159,marwyn,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER_1,Right.  The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...
22160,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,All rulers demand that people bend the knee.  It's why they're rulers.  She gave Tarley a choice.  A man who had taken up arms against her.  What else could she do?
22161,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,Not burn him alive alongside his son.
22162,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,"I am her hand, not her head.  I can't make her decisions for her."
22163,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,That's what I used to tell myself about her father.  I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive.  I was only a purveyor of information.
22164,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,"It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it.""  As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it.""  When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it."""
22165,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,Daenerys is not her father.
22166,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,And she never will be... with the right counsel.  You need to find a way to make her listen.
22167,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,Who is that for?
22168,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,Jon Snow.
22169,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,Did you read it?
22170,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
22171,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,What's it say?
22172,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM_5,Nothing good.
22173,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,I thought Arya was dead.  I thought Bran was dead.
22174,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,I'm happy for you.  You don't look happy.
22175,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch.  If they make it past the wall --
22176,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years.  Presumably --
22177,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,I need to go home.
22178,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,You said you don't have enough men.
22179,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,We'll fight with the men we have.  Unless you'll join us.
22180,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,And give the country to Cersei?  As soon as I march away she marches in.
22181,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,Perhaps not.  Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children.  What if we prove her wrong?
22182,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
22183,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,So bring the dead to her.
22184,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
22185,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,We don't have to bring the whole army.  Only one soldier.
22186,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,Is that possible?
22187,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
22188,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
22189,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
22190,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,The only person she listens to is Jaime.  He may listen to me.
22191,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,And how would you get into King's Landing.
22192,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,"I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter."
22193,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,"Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men."
22194,varys,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,Fair point.  How do you propose to find one?
22195,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
22196,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.  Allow me to serve you.
22197,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,The free folk will help us.  They know the real north better than anyone.
22198,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,They won't follow Ser Jorah.
22199,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,They won't have to.
22200,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,You can't lead a raid beyond the wall.  You're not in the Night's Watch anymore.  You're King in the North.
22201,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,I'm the only one here whose fought them.  I'm the only one here who knows them.
22202,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,I haven't given you permission to leave.
22203,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_9,"With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.  I am a king.  And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive.  I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people.  Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance."
22204,robett glover,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - THE GREAT HALL_1,"The King in the North should stay in the north.  We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have."
22205,yohn royce,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - THE GREAT HALL_1,"The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark."
22206,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - THE GREAT HALL_1,"You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king.  He is doing what he thinks is best."
22207,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,I warned Jon this would happen.  He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
22208,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,He didn't.  He trusted you to hold it for him.
22209,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,"Well, he's not making it easy.  The northern lords are proud."
22210,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,These are mother and father's chambers.
22211,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,And?
22212,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,Nothing.
22213,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,Don't do that.
22214,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,What?
22215,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,Say what you mean.
22216,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,You always liked nice things.  It made you feel better than everyone.
22217,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,Are you angry with me?
22218,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
22219,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,"I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell."
22220,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,Their opinions are important to you?
22221,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,"Glover has 500 men.  Royce has 2,000.  Offend them and Jon loses his army."
22222,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,Not if they lose their heads first.
22223,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,"Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands.  We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together.  Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together."
22224,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,"And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want."
22225,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,How can you even think such a horrible thing?
22226,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,"You're thinking it right now.  You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away."
22227,sansa stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,I have work to do.
22228,arya stark,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_1,My lady.
22229,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
22230,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.
22231,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.  The guards hardly ever patrol it.  Too many steps.
22232,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,You're not staying here?
22233,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
22234,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,What if someone takes the boat?
22235,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_1,Then we're fucked.  Best hurry.
22236,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,We don't have time for this.  We should be preparing the city for a siege.  The Dothraki are coming.
22237,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,All the more reason for you to train.  Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
22238,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
22239,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,And here I am ready to train.
22240,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,Why down here?
22241,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
22242,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
22243,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"Oh, you won't be swinging it at me."
22244,bronn,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,I'll leave you to it.
22245,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
22246,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"You made me look like a complete fool.  I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me.  You abandoned the family home.  Completely unsentimental.  Father would have been proud."
22247,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,Don't talk about our father.
22248,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,Listen to me --
22249,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
22250,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
22251,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,"He was going to execute me.  He knew I was innocent.  He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am.  The little monster sent to punish him.  Do you think I wanted to be born this way?  Did he think I chose --"
22252,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,What do you want?
22253,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,Daenerys will win this war.  You're a military man.  You must know there is no way around it.  Daenerys is not her father.  She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
22254,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
22255,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS_1,I -- I don't.  Daenerys doesn't.  Not right now anyway.  She has a more important request.
22256,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,I wasn't sure I'd find you.
22257,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,I thought you might still be rowing.
22258,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,"I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.  I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel."
22259,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
22260,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,I haven't been here in years.  Why should they recognize me?  Sometimes I hardly do.  Nothing fucks you harder than time.
22261,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,Anybody give you any trouble?
22262,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,Here I am arming Lannisters.  I never get a second look.  You were right.  Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
22263,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,Don't be so sure.  Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.  Bad things are coming.
22264,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,You came to get me.  You want me to come with you.
22265,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,I think you need to understand --
22266,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,I'm ready.  Let's go.
22267,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,You should know what you're heading into.
22268,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father?  They tried to kill me.
22269,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,"I've been getting ready.  I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes."
22270,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,You might want to bring one of those swords.
22271,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,"I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --"
22272,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM_1,-- this I know.
22273,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,Keep your father's name to yourself.  The situation is complicated enough already.
22274,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,Who should I say I am?
22275,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,"I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --"
22277,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,"No weapons, friends.  I promise.  What can I do for you?"
22279,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,It is.
22281,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,That they are.  I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.
22282,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,Still five gold dragons?
22285,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,15?
22287,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
22289,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,Not more gold.
22294,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,Come and have a look.
22295,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,Fermented crab.
22297,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,"Fermented crab.  One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week.  A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.  Five minutes later, he's back in the race.  Here, have a taste."
22298,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.
22300,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.
22303,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,Fish hook.  Some men you just can't teach.
22305,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,Perhaps there's some arrangement?
22307,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,This is Gendry.
22308,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,KING'S LANDING - BEACH_3,He'll do.
22309,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,That won't be necessary.
22310,qyburn,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,Ser Jaime.
22311,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,Why was QYBURN here?
22312,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,He's Hand of the Queen.  Why are you here?
22313,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,I met with Tyrion.
22314,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,What did our brother have to say?
22315,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,Daenerys wants to meet.
22316,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,To discuss a surrender?
22317,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,To discuss an armistice.
22318,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,She just won a great victory.  Why would she want a truce now?
22319,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.  Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
22320,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,Are you going to punish him?
22321,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,Tyrion?
22322,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,Bronn.
22323,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,He betrayed you.  He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent.  Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
22324,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,You let it happen.  Why?
22325,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,"I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest.  She has the numbers.  If we want to beat her we have to be clever.  We have to fight her like father would have.  Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house.  For this."
22326,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,Who will you say is the father?
22327,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,You.
22328,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,People won't like that.
22329,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,Do you remember what father used to say about people?
22330,jaime lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
22331,cersei lannister,7,65,eastwatch,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS_1,Never betray me again.
22332,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,We're leaving today.  The king's got a lot on his mind.
22333,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,I understand.
22334,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
22335,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,You don't have to worry.
22336,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges."
22337,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,Understood.
22338,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"Begging your pardon, Your Grace."
22339,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,You survived King's Landing.
22340,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,Yet again.
22341,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"Your Grace, this is --"
22342,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"It's Gendry, Your Grace.  I'm Robert Baratheon's son.  Bastard son."
22343,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,He was meant to keep that to himself.
22344,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,Our fathers trusted each other.  Why shouldn't we?
22345,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,I saw your father once at Winterfell.
22346,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,I met yours in my shop.
22347,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,You're a lot leaner.
22348,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,You're a lot shorter.
22349,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,I grew up on stories about them.
22350,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"All I ever knew was they fought together and won.  Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why.  Let me come with you."
22351,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,Don't be a fool.  You're not a soldier.
22352,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"No, but I'm a fighter.  And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that."
22353,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,Do you know how to use one?
22354,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"Well, that's a problem."
22355,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,I prefer a hammer.
22356,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,He can handle himself.
22357,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,We could use the help.
22358,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life."
22359,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,"I owe you my life.  Twice over.  But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war."
22360,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_7,Yeah.  Nobody mind me.  All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
22361,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,"You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont.  Nobody glowers quite like you.  Not even Grey Worm."
22362,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us.  Remember?
22363,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
22364,tyrion lannister,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,Take it with you.  You'll bring it back.  Our queen needs you.
22365,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,We should be better at saying farewell by now.
22366,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,"Your Grace, I --"
22367,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.
22368,daenerys targaryen,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,But I've grown used to him.
22369,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,"I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace."
22370,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH_9,Heave!
22371,gilly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?
22372,sam,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,No.
22373,gilly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,"15,782."
22374,gilly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.
22375,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,None anymore.
22376,gilly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,"That's true.  This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything.  He even recorded his own bowel movements.  What does ""annulment"" mean?"
22377,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
22378,gilly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne.  Is that a common thing --
22379,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,"These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored.  But that's all right, isn't it.  We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynard's 15,782 shits."
22380,gilly,7,65,eastwatch,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS_1,Steps.  That number was steps.
22381,gilly,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. CITADEL_1,Are you sure you want to do this?  You always wanted to be a maester.
22382,samwell tarly,7,65,eastwatch,EXT. CITADEL_1,I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.
22383,wolkan,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_3,"I found it, my Lord."
22384,wolkan,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_3,It took some searching.  Maester Llewyn's archives are thorough.
22385,petyr baelish,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_3,Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?
22386,wolkan,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_3,"Yes, my Lord."
22387,petyr baelish,7,65,eastwatch,WINTERFELL - HALLS_3,Lady Stark thanks you for your service.
22389,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?
22390,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,I've been failing at that job of late.
22391,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,How many queens are there now?
22392,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,Two.
22393,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?
22394,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,Both.
22395,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,How many men did you bring?
22396,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,Not enough.
22397,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,The big woman?
22398,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,We were hoping some of your men could help.
22399,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,I'll be staying behind.  I'm a liability out there as you well know.
22400,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,You are.
22401,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,You really want to go out there again?
22402,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL_1,You're not the only ones.
22403,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall.  Said they were on their way here.
22404,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,You're The Hound.  I saw you once at Winterfell.
22405,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,They want to go beyond the Wall too.
22406,beric dondarrion,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,"We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to.  Our lord told us the great war is coming."
22407,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,Don't trust them.  Don't trust any of them.
22408,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,They're the Brotherhood.  And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.
22409,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,Thoros?
22410,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,I hardly recognized you.
22411,thoros,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,Ser Jorah Mormont --
22412,thoros,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,They won't give me anything to drink down here.  I haven't been feeling like myself.
22413,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,You're a fucking Mormont?  Like the last Lord Commander?
22414,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,He was my father.
22415,tormund,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,He hunted us like animals.
22416,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,"You returned the favor, as I recall."
22417,beric dondarrion,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.
22418,davos seaworth,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,Our reasons aren't your reasons.
22419,beric dondarrion,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
22420,beric dondarrion,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not.  We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --
22421,sandor clegane,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,"For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole.  Are we coming with you or not?"
22422,jorah mormont,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,Don't you want to know what we're doing?
22423,thoros,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?
22424,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,He's right.  We're all on the same side.
22425,gendry,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,How can we be?
22426,jon snow,7,65,eastwatch,EASTWATCH - CELLS_1,We're all breathing.
22427,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,Are you all right?
22428,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,Ever been north before?
22429,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,Never seen snow before.
22430,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"Beautiful, eh?  I can breath again.  Down south the air smells like pig shit."
22431,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,You've never been down south.
22432,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,I've been to Winterfell.
22433,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,That's the north.
22434,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,How do you live up here?  How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
22435,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"You have to keep moving.  That's the secret.  Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best."
22436,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
22437,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,We have to make due with what we've got.
22438,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,This one is maybe not so smart.
22439,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,Davos says he is a strong fighter.
22440,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,Good.  That's more important than being smart.
22441,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead.  So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?  And?"
22442,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
22443,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling.  Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man.  The king beyond the wall never bent the knee.  How many of his people died for his pride?"
22444,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"Are you still mad at us, boy?"
22445,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,You sold me to a witch.
22446,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"Priestess.  I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction."
22447,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,We're fighting a great war.  Wars cost money.
22448,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"I wanted to be one of you.  I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave.  Do you know what she did to me?  She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --"
22449,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,Sounds all right so far.
22450,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,-- and put leeches on me.
22451,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,Was she naked too?
22452,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,She needed your blood.
22453,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,Yes. Thank you.  I know that.
22454,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,It could have been worse.
22455,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,She wanted to kill me.  They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
22456,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"But they didn't, did they?  So what you whinging about?"
22457,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,I'm not whinging.
22458,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.  That's whinging.
22459,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,This one's been killed six times.  You don't hear him bitching about it.
22460,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,Good lad.
22461,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
22462,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,He was a good man.  He deserved a better son.  Were you with him at the end?
22463,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,I was a prisoner of the Wildlings.  But we avenged him.  I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
22464,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"I can't think of a worse way for him to go.  The Night's Watch was his life.  He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him."
22465,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,I hate that he died that way.  My father was the most honorable man I ever met.  He was good all the way through.  And he died on the executioner's block.
22466,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,Your father wanted to execute me.
22467,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,I heard.
22468,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,He was in the right of course.  It didn't make me hate him any less.
22469,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,I'm glad he didn't capture you.
22470,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,Me too.
22471,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,"Your father gave me this sword.  He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw."
22472,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
22473,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries.  It's not right for me to have it.
22474,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,He gave it to you.
22475,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,I'm not his son.
22476,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,I brought shame to my house.  I broke my father's heart.
22477,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_11,I forfeited the right to claim this sword.  It's yours.  May it serve you well and your children after you.
22478,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,Father used to watch us from up here.  He wouldn't say much.  You probably don't remember.  You were inside knitting all the time.
22479,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,I remember.
22480,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick.  I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground.  Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw.  There was one arrow in the target.  There was no one around, just like now.  No one to stop me.  So I started shooting.  And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.  I wasn't very good.  Finally I hit the bullseye.  It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th.  I don't remember.  But I hit the bullseye and I heard this."
22481,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me.  I knew what I was doing was against the rules.  But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong.  The rules were wrong.  I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.  Now he's dead.  Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
22482,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,What?
22483,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"That's your pretty handwriting.  Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you.  ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart.  Our good King Robert is dead.  Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --"
22484,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,You don't have to read it.  I remember.
22485,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"""Father has been charged with treason.  He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne.  The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort.  I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark.  Your faithful sister, Sansa."""
22486,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,They forced me to do it.
22487,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,Did they.  With a knife at your throat?  Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
22488,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,You don't know what it was like.  I was a child.
22489,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,So was I.  I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
22490,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,They told me it was the only way to save father.
22491,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,And you were stupid enough to believe them.  I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block.  I remember the pretty dress you were wearing.  I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
22492,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,You were there?
22493,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
22494,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,And what did you do?  Did you come running to the rescue?  Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
22495,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,I wanted to.
22496,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,But you didn't.  Just like me.
22497,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,I didn't betray him.  I didn't betray Robb.  I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
22498,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"You should be on your knees thanking me.  We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.  You didn't win it back.  Jon didn't win it back.  He lost the Battle of the Bastards.  The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?"
22499,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,I was training.
22500,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"Training.  Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine."
22501,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"Oh, I don't know about that.  I can imagine quite a lot."
22502,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,You never would have survived what I survived.
22503,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,I guess we'll never know.
22504,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,What are you doing to do with that letter.
22505,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,I don't know yet.
22506,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,Who did you show it to?  Where did you find it?
22507,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"You're scared, aren't you?  What are you scared of?  You didn't commit any crimes.  No one's going to hang you."
22508,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,Arya --
22509,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry?  No.  That's not Jon.  He'll understand.  You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
22510,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting?  This is exactly what she wants.  This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --"
22511,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,"The northern lords will read it.  They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.  What would little Lyanna Mormont say?  She's younger than you were when you wrote this.  Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
22512,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,You're angry.  Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
22513,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_13,Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.  I'll go with anger.
22514,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,You’re the one they call the dog.
22515,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Fuck off.
22516,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,They told me you were mean.  Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?
22517,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,I don't give two shits about Wildlings.
22518,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Gingers I hate.
22519,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Gingers are beautiful.  We are kissed by fire.  Just like you.
22520,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Don't point your fucking finger at me.
22521,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
22522,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,I didn't trip.  I was pushed.
22523,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Ever since you've been mean.
22524,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Will you fuck off?
22525,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,I don't think you're truly mean.  You have sad eyes.
22526,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Do you want to suck my dick?  Is that it?
22527,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Dick?
22528,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Cock.
22529,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Ah.  Dick.  I like it.
22530,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,I bet you do.
22531,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Nope.  It's pussy for me.  I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell.  If I ever get back there.  Yellow hair.  Blue eyes.  Tallest woman you've ever seen.  Almost as tall as you.
22532,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Brienne of Tarth.
22533,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,You know her?
22534,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
22535,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,"Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me."
22536,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,How does she look at you?  Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
22537,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,You do know her.
22538,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,We've met.
22539,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,I want to make babies with her.  Think of the great big monsters.  They'd conquer the world.
22540,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
22541,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,I'm good at killing people.
22542,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,You don't much look like him.
22543,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Who's that?
22544,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Your father.  I suppose you favor your mother.
22545,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,You knew him?
22546,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Of course I did.  When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain.  Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back.  Thoros has brought me back six times.  We both serve the same lord.
22547,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,I serve the north.
22548,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,The north didn't raise you from the dead.
22549,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,The lord of light never spoke to me.  I don't know anything about him.  I don't know what he wants from me.
22550,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,He wants you alive.
22551,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Why?
22552,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,I don't know.
22553,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,"That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know.  So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
22554,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,I think about that all the time.  I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing.  We're soldiers.  We have to know what we're fighting for.  I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
22555,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,So what are you fighting for?
22556,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Life.  Death is the enemy.  The first enemy and the last.
22557,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,But we all die.
22558,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,The enemy always wins.  And we still need to fight him.  That's all I know.  You and I wont find much joy while we're here.  But we can keep others alive.  We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
22559,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,"""I am the shield that guards the realms of men."""
22560,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that.  Maybe that's enough.
22561,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Aye.  Maybe that's enough.
22562,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,That's what I saw in the fire.
22563,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,A mountain like an arrowhead.
22564,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,Are you sure?
22565,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,- BEYOND THE WALL_1,We're getting close.
22566,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,Do you know what I like about you?
22567,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,I honestly don't.
22568,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,You're not a hero.
22569,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,Oh.  I've been heroic on occasion.
22570,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
22571,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"I don't want you to be a hero.  Heroes do stupid things and they die.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."
22572,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"It's interesting these heroes you name.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
22573,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,Jon Snow's not in love with me.
22574,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"Oh, my mistake.  I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."
22575,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,He's too little for me. I didn't mean
22576,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,As heroes go he is quite little.
22577,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,I know you're brave. I wouldn't have chosen a coward as my Hand.
22578,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"So if all goes well, I'll finally get to meet your sister. From everything you've told me about her she'd rather murder me than speak with me."
22579,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"Oh first she'd torture you in some horrible way, then she'd murder you. Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me. But if we go to the capital, we'll go with two armies, we'll go with three dragons, and anyone touches you, King's Landing burns down to the foundation stone."
22580,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,And right now she's thinking of how to set a trap.
22581,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,Of course she is. And she's wondering what trap you're laying for her.
22582,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,Are we? Laying any traps?
22583,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"If we want to create a new and better world, I'm not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start."
22584,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?
22585,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"Yes, you'll need to be ruthless if you're going to win the throne. You need to inspire a degree of fear. But fear is all Cersei has. It's all my father had, and Joffrey. It makes their power brittle. Because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead."
22586,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.
22587,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"He did. But you once spoke to me of breaking the wheel. Aegon built the wheel. If that's the kind of queen you want to be, how are you different from all the other tyrants that came before you?"
22588,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,So we walk into the lion's den?
22589,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,My brother promised me he'd keep a grip on the Lannister forces.
22590,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"Forgive me, but I don't care about any Lannister promises. Except yours."
22591,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,And I promised him I'd keep you from doing anything impulsive.
22592,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,Impulsive?
22593,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,This will be a difficult negotiation. We're sitting down with people who want to see us both headless. My sister is likely to say something provocative.
22594,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,And?
22595,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,And you've been known to lose your temper from time to time. As all our great leaders do
22596,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,When have I lost my temper?
22597,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,Burning the Tarlys for instance.
22598,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,That was not impulsive. That was necessary.
22599,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,Perhaps.
22600,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,Perhaps.
22601,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,Perhaps the father needed to die and not the son. Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate the mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell. We had no time to discuss the possibilities before you ended their possibilities.
22602,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,One can be forgiven for thinking you're taking your family's side in this debate.
22603,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"I am taking their side. You need to take your enemy's side if you're going to see things the way they do. And you need to see things the way they do if you're going to anticipate their actions, respond effectively and beat them. Which I want you to do very much. Because I believe in you and the world you want to build. But the world you want to build doesn't get built all at once. Probably not in a single lifetime. How do we ensure your vision endures? After you break the wheel, how do we make sure it stays broken?"
22604,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"You want to know who sits on the Iron Throne after I'm dead, is that it?"
22605,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"You say you can't have children. But there are other ways of choosing a successor. The Night's Watch has one method, The Iron born folk, although many flaws"
22606,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.
22607,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows fly towards you when you fought on Blackwater Rush, and I saw hundred of arrows miss. But any one of them could have found your heart and end"
22608,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"You've been thinking about my death quite a bit, haven't you? Is this one of the items you've discussed with your brother in King's Landing?"
22609,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,I'm trying to serve you by planning for the long term.
22610,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE_11,"Perhaps if you'd planned for the short term, we wouldn't have lost Dorne and Highgarden. We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown."
22611,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21,Look!
22612,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21,A  bear.
22613,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21,Big fucker.
22614,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21,Do bears have blue eyes?
22615,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21,We have to get him back to Eastwatch.
22616,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21,(Shakes his head.) Flask.
22617,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21,Go on.
22618,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21,You alright?
22619,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21,I just got bit by a dead bear.
22620,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21,Aye. You did.
22621,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,NORTH OF THE WALL_21,Funny old life. Alright then.
22622,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,Where did she get it?
22623,petyr baelish,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,I don't know. She seems very resourceful. You're worried.
22624,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,We're asking 20 000 men to fight with us in the worst winter any of them have ever seen. The weather will be the least of their problems. Many of them will be happy to find a good reason to go home.
22625,petyr baelish,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,You question their loyalty?
22626,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,Their loyalty is to JON SNOW. JON SNOW is not here. I haven't heard from him in weeks.
22627,petyr baelish,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,You're the Lady of Winterfell. The King chose you to rule in his absence. And rule you have. Wisely. Ably. They see that. They respect you. Some may even prefer you.
22628,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,"Yes, they turned their backs on JON SNOW when it was time to retake Winterfell and then they named him their king and now they're ready to turn their backs on him again. How far would you trust men like that? They're all bloody wind vanes. If they found out I wrote that letter a woman who's already married not one but two enemies of her House.  By the time JON SNOW comes back, he'll have no army left."
22629,petyr baelish,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,"Arya is not like them. She's your sister. You may have disagreements, but she would never betray her family."
22630,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,She would if she thought I was going to betray JON SNOW.
22631,petyr baelish,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,Is that what she thinks?
22632,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,I don't know what she thinks. I don't know her anymore.
22633,petyr baelish,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,Perhaps Lady Brienne can help. She's sworn to protect both of Catelyn Stark's girls. Did she not?
22634,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,She is.
22635,petyr baelish,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,"And if one of you were planning to harm the other in any way, wouldn't she be honor bound to intercede?"
22636,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,WINTERFELL INTERIOR_1,She would.
22637,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,Something I've always wanted to know.
22638,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,Alright.
22639,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,How drunk were you when you charged through the breach on Pyke?
22640,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,"If I'm being honest, I don't remember charging through the breach. Some of the lads told me about it the next morning. Sounded like a good scrap."
22641,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,Aye. It was a proper scrap. The Ironborn thought you were some kind of god. The way you were waving that flaming sword. I thought you were the bravest man I ever saw.
22642,thoros,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,Just the drunkest.
22643,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,Where's the rest of them?
22644,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,If we wait long enough we will find out.
22645,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,(Nods)
22646,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,"Go back to Eastwatch. Get a raven to Daenerys, tell her what's happened."
22647,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,I'm not leaving you.
22648,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,You're the fastest. Go! Now!
22649,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,You're faster without the hammer. Give it! Give it!
22650,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,Come on! Run!
22651,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,Come on!
22652,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,Stop!
22653,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,BEYOND THE WALL_13,Go!
22654,davos seaworth,7,66,beyond the wall,GENDRY running._3,What happened? Where are the others?
22655,gendry,7,66,beyond the wall,GENDRY running._3,Raven. We need to send the raven.
22656,davos seaworth,7,66,beyond the wall,GENDRY running._3,Get the maester! Now!
22657,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,Thoros?
22658,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,Thoros!
22659,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,I say it's one of the better ways to go.
22660,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,"Lord of Light, show us the way. Come to us in our darkness and lead your servant into the light."
22661,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,We have to burn this body.
22662,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,And all the clothes behind him. Unless the Lord of Light is kind enough to send us a bit of fire.
22663,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,Come to us in our darkness. For the night is dark and full of terrors.
22664,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,"We'll all freeze soon. I saw the water. When you killed the white walker, almost all the dead that followed it fell. Why?"
22665,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,Maybe he was the one who turned them.
22666,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,We can go for the walkers. Maybe we'll stand a chance.
22667,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,No. We need to take that thing back with us. There's a raven flying for Dragonstone now. Daenerys is our only chance.
22668,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,No. There's another.
22669,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,Kill him. He turned them all.
22670,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,You don't understand
22671,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,"The Lord brought you back he brought me back No one else, just us. Did he do it to watch us freeze to death?"
22672,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,"Careful, Beric, you've lost your priest. This is your last life."
22673,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,I've been waiting for the end for a long time. Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it.
22674,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,The frozen lake._3,Every Lord I've ever met it's been a cunt. Can't see why the Lord of Light should be any different.
22675,wolkan,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,My lady.
22676,wolkan,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,My lady?
22677,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_1,It's an invitation. To King's Landing.
22678,brienne of tarth,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,"My lady, you are the Lady of Winterfell."
22679,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,"I am, and you will represent my interest at this gathering as you see them."
22680,brienne of tarth,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,"They invited you, they want you there."
22681,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,"I will not set foot in King's Landing while Cersei Lannister is queen. They want another Stark prisoner, they can come and take me. Until then, I'll remain where I belong. I have work to do here."
22682,brienne of tarth,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,It's not safe.
22683,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,Ser Jaime will be there. You said he treated you honourably before.
22684,brienne of tarth,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,I'm not worried about me. It's not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.
22685,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,I have many guards who'd happily imprison him or behead him whether or not you're here.
22686,brienne of tarth,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,And you trust their loyalty? You trust he hasn't been speaking to them behind your back? Let me at least leave Podrick behind to watch over you. He has become a competent swordsman.
22687,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,"I do not need to be watched over or minded or cared for. I'm not a child, I am the Lady of Winterfell and I am home. This is the safest place for me."
22688,brienne of tarth,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,My lady. I sworn an oath to protect you and your sister. If I abandon you
22689,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,"The trip to King's Landing is long, Lady Brienne, and you won't be travelling on summer roads. The sooner you leave, the better your chances of making it on time."
22690,brienne of tarth,7,66,beyond the wall,Another Winterfell interior_1,"Yes, Milady."
22691,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior_1,You can't! The most important person in the world can't fly to the most dangerous place in the world.
22692,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior_1,Who else can?
22693,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior_1,No one. They knew the risk when they left. You can't win the throne if you're dead. You can't break the wheel if you're dead.
22694,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior_1,So what would you have me do?
22695,tyrion lannister,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior_1,"Nothing. Sometimes nothing is the hardest thing to do. If you die we're all lost. Everyone, everything"
22696,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,Dragonstone exterior_1,You told me to do nothing before and I've listened to you. I'm not doing nothing again.
22697,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1,Damn cunt.
22698,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1,"Oh, fuck."
22699,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1,Fuck it!
22700,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1,Fall back! Fall back!
22701,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1,Come on!
22702,tormund,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1,No!
22703,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1,JON SNOW!
22704,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_1,Go! Go now! Leave!
22705,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_3,Uncle Benjen! How?
22706,benjen stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_3,You ride for the pass.
22707,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_3,Come with me.
22708,benjen stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Frozen lake_3,It's not time. Go!
22709,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,"The Wall,  Northern Coast_1",(Nods)
22710,tormund giantsbane,7,66,beyond the wall,"The Wall,  Northern Coast_1",(Nods)
22711,beric dondarrion,7,66,beyond the wall,"The Wall,  Northern Coast_1","We'll meet again, Clegane."
22712,sandor clegane,7,66,beyond the wall,"The Wall,  Northern Coast_1",Fucking hope not.
22713,jorah mormont,7,66,beyond the wall,Top of the The Wall_1,"It's time to go, Your Grace."
22714,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,Top of the The Wall_1,A bit longer.
22717,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,Not what you're looking for?
22718,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,"(Gasps). I have hundreds of men here at Winterfell, all loyal to me."
22719,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,They're not here now.
22720,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,What are these?
22721,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,My faces.
22722,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,Where did you get them?
22723,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,"In Braavos, while I was training to be a faceless man."
22724,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,What does that mean?
22725,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,"Back in Braavos, before I got my first face, there was I game I used to play. The game of faces. It's simple"
22726,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,I don't want to play.
22727,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,How do you feel about JON SNOW being king? Is there someone else you feel should rule the North instead of him?
22728,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,"Those faces, what are they?"
22729,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,You want to do the asking? Are you sure? The game of faces didn't turn out so well for the last person who asked me questions.
22730,sansa stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,Tell me what they are!
22731,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,"We both wanted to be other people when we were younger. You wanted to be a queen. To sit next to a handsome young king on the Iron Throne. I wanted to be a knight, to pick up a sword like father and go off to battle. Neither of us got to be the other person, did we? The world doesn't just let girls decide what they are going to be. But I can now. With the faces I can choose. I can become someone else. Speak in their voice, live in their skin. I can even become you."
22732,arya stark,7,66,beyond the wall,Winterfell interior_3,I wonder what it would feel like to wear those pretty dresses. To be the Lady of Winterfell. All I'd need to find out is your face.
22733,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1",I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
22734,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1",I wish I could take it back. I wish we'd never gone.
22735,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1",I don't. If we hadn't gone I wouldn't have seen. You have to see it to know. Now I know. The dragons are my children. They're the only children I'll ever have. Do you understand?
22736,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1",(Nods.)
22737,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1",We are going to destroy the Night King and his army. And we'll do it together. You have my word.
22738,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1","Thank you, Dany."
22739,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1","Dany? Who was the last person who called me that? I'm not sure, was it my brother? Not the company you want to keep."
22740,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1","Alright. Not Dany. How about ""My Queen""? I'd bend the knee but..."
22741,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1",What about those who swore allegiance to you?
22742,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1",They'll all come to see you for what you are.
22743,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1",I hope I deserve it.
22744,jon snow,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1",You do.
22745,daenerys targaryen,7,66,beyond the wall,"Ship interior, at sea_1",You should get some rest.
22746,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_97,Oil?
22748,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_97,How many barrels?
22750,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_97,Get 500 more.
22752,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_97,"I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord."""
22753,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_97,The thrill will fade.
22754,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_97,If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?
22755,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_97,Gold?
22756,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_97,I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
22757,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_97,Family.
22758,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_97,"Not without a cock, you don't."
22759,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_97,Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
22760,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_97,Yet your brother chooses to side with the cockless.
22761,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_97,"Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden."
22762,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_97,I think we're about to be the downtrodden.
22765,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1,How many people live here?
22766,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1,"A million, give or take."
22767,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1,That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
22768,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1,There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
22769,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1,Why isn't she with them?
22770,qyburn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1,"I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her."
22771,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1,And the rest of them?
22772,qyburn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1,They're on their way to the dragon pit now.
22773,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1,Including our brother.
22774,qyburn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Deck of Ironborn Ship._1,"Yes, Your Grace."
22775,missandei,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_99,Why did they build it?
22776,jorah mormont,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_99,"Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem."
22777,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_99,"I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world."
22778,davos seaworth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_99,Maybe it still is.
22779,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_99,"Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did."
22780,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_99,I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.
22781,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_99,A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.
22782,podrick payne,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_99,"I never thought I'd see you again, my lord."
22783,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_99,"Supporting the enemy, no less."
22784,podrick payne,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_99,Hard to blame you.
22785,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_99,Cersei will anyway.
22786,podrick payne,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_99,I'm glad you're alive.
22787,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_99,Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.
22788,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Unnamed Scene_99,(Shakes his head.)
22790,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,Fuck off.
22791,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,I thought you were dead.
22792,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,Not yet. You came pretty close.
22793,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,I was only trying to protect her.
22794,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,You and me both.
22795,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,She's alive. Arya.
22796,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,Where?
22797,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,Winterfell.
22798,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,Who's protecting her if you're here?
22799,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.
22800,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,It won't be me.
22801,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.
22802,podrick payne,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,"It is, my lord."
22803,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,"I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
22804,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,I'm sure your new queen will be happy to restore yours if she ends up on the throne.
22805,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,"You've been thinking about our new queen? Perhaps you’ve been reconsidering your allegiances. Remember my offer – whatever they’re paying you, I’ll pay double.”"
22806,varys,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,"And that would be double what now, exactly?"
22807,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
22808,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,"Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
22809,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,"I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
22810,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,It's good to see you again.
22811,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Further back on the road._1,"Yeah, you, too."
22812,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Outside the Dragon PIt_1,"Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first."
22813,bronn,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?"
22814,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?
22815,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,You might.
22816,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.
22817,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
22818,sandor clegane,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother. You know who’s coming for you. You’ve always known."
22819,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Where is she?
22820,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,She'll be here soon.
22821,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Didn't travel with you?
22822,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,No.
22823,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,We've been here for some time.
22824,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,My apologies.
22825,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,We are all facing a unique--
22826,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"Theon! I have your sister. If you don’t submit to me here, now… I’ll kill her."
22827,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
22828,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.
22829,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes?
22830,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,His wasn't even good.
22831,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
22832,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents."
22833,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Perhaps you ought to sit down.
22834,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Why?
22835,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Sit down or leave.
22836,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face."
22837,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?"
22838,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,We all know that will never happen.
22839,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Then why are we here?
22840,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
22841,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
22842,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
22843,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce."
22844,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Yes. That's all.
22845,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
22846,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
22847,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,The word of a would-be usurper.
22848,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
22849,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,We can destroy them by burning them.
22850,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world."
22851,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
22852,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.
22853,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,How many?
22854,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"A hundred thousand, at least."
22855,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Can they swim?
22856,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,No.
22857,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.
22858,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,What are you talking about?
22859,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me."
22860,euron greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive."
22861,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."
22862,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,(SIGHS)
22863,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"In return, the King"
22864,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Just the King
22865,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"(CHUCKLES) I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son."
22866,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
22867,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.
22868,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Ser Jaime.
22869,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
22870,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.
22871,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother."
22872,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"Oh, fuck loyalty!"
22873,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Fuck loyalty?
22874,brienne of tarth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.
22875,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,And tell her what?
22876,davos seaworth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,I wish you hadn't done that.
22877,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing."
22878,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,I know!
22879,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen  I would have advised it, had you asked. But have you ever considered learning how to lie every now and then? Just a bit?"
22880,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father if you want, tell me that’s the attitude that got him killed. But when enough people make false promises, words stop meaning anything. Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies, and lies won’t help us in this fight."
22881,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
22882,davos seaworth,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
22883,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,"Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
22884,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,I didn't come all this way to have my Hand murdered.
22885,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
22886,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,I did this. I should go.
22887,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister alone. Or we all go home and we’re right back where we started.
22888,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Dragon Pit_1,(Nods)
22889,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing portico_1,You spoke with her?
22890,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing portico_1,"At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
22891,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing portico_1,"I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?"
22892,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,King's Landing portico_1,"I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another."
22893,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place."
22894,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you."
22895,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"So you bring her here with her pet Northerner,  whom you've convinced to bow down before her."
22896,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,I didn't know about that.
22897,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life."
22898,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"Cersei, I didn't know."
22899,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,the destruction of this family.
22900,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
22901,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,You killed our father
22902,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me."
22903,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one would've touched them if Father was here, no one would have dared-"
22904,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,I have never been more sorry about anything.
22905,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"I will not hear it, not from you."
22906,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,(starts)
22907,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,I will not hear it!
22908,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me."
22909,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"If it weren’t for me, you’d have a mother. If it weren’t for me, you’d have a father. If it weren’t for me, you’d have two beautiful children. I’ve thought about killing you more times than I can count. (turns to the MOUNTAIN) Do it! (turns back to Cersei) Say the word."
22910,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
22911,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,I will not
22912,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
22913,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.
22914,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?"
22915,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
22916,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something."
22917,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,What did you hope for?  To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.
22918,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"Mm, not like this."
22919,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her."
22920,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,Yes.
22921,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,Why?
22922,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,Because I think she will make the world a better place.
22923,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
22924,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
22925,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.
22926,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,"That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter."
22927,tyrion lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Council Chamber._1,You're pregnant.
22928,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1,No one is less happy about this than I am.
22929,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1,"I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it."
22930,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1,"This place was the beginning of the end for my family. (Speaks Valerian.) A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else."
22931,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1,You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
22932,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1,I can't have children.
22933,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1,Who told you that?
22934,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1,The witch who murdered my husband.
22935,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1,Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
22936,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1,"You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
22937,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1,"So, what now?"
22938,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1,I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
22939,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1,It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
22940,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1,(Laughs)
22941,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Side Area of the Dragon Pit_1,"My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them."
22942,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
22943,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,"No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?"
22944,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
22945,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,"This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee."
22946,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
22947,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,What does that have to do with anything?
22948,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
22949,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,You think he wants to marry her?
22950,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,"An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King."
22951,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,"Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family."
22952,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,"You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?"
22953,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
22954,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,"Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men."
22955,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?
22956,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,She's your sister. You know her far better than I ever could.
22957,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.
22958,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,Why did she come to Winterfell?
22959,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
22960,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
22961,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.
22962,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,"And after she murders you, what does she become?"
22963,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell interior_5,Lady of Winterfell.
22964,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room_1,"If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight."
22965,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room_1,"And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell."
22966,jorah mormont,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room_1,"Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror."
22967,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room_1,"It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message."
22968,daenerys targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Map Room_1,I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.
22969,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,Jon.
22970,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,Can I speak with you?
22971,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,All right.
22972,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,"What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You could've lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth."
22973,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.
22974,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,"You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step."
22975,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,"It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret."
22976,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,"Not compared to me, you haven't."
22977,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,No. Not compared to you.
22978,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.
22979,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,Our father was more of a father to you than yours ever was.
22980,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,He was.
22981,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.
22982,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,I did.
22983,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,(SIGHS) But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.
22984,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,But the things I've done.
22985,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,"It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark."
22986,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,"When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. (SNIFFLES) She needs me now."
22987,jon snow,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Dragonstone Throne Room_1,"So, why are you still talking to me?"
22988,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,"Load up. Load up, lads. Go on. Tide's coming in."
22989,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,All of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind.
22990,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,Your sister’s dead.
22991,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,She's not dead.
22992,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,"She's dead. Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead."
22993,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,She's our queen
22994,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,She's your sister and you left her to die.
22995,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,I did. I ran from my uncle. I was a coward.
22996,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,"So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves."
22997,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,We're done with all that.
22998,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,Who says we are?
22999,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,"Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free."
23000,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,"Run away, little Theon. It's what you do best."
23005,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,Stay down or I'll kill you!
23006,harrag,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,(panting) I said stay down or I'll kill you!
23007,theon greyjoy,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The shores of King's Landing_1,Not for me. For Yara!
23009,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_1,Have my sister
23010,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,Are you sure you want to do this?
23011,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.
23012,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,And what does honor demand?
23013,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.
23014,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"All right, then. Get on with it."
23015,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?
23016,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,My sister asked you a question.
23017,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused."
23018,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?"
23019,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,I did it to protect you.
23020,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon Arryn. You gave Lysa Tears of Lys to poison him. Do you deny it?"
23021,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"Whatever your aunt might have told you, she was a troubled woman. She imagined enemies everywhere."
23022,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn when, really, it was you. The conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters, it was you who started it. Do you deny it?"
23023,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,I know of no such letter.
23024,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father, Ned Stark. Thanks to your treachery, he was imprisoned and later executed on false charges of treason. Do you deny it?"
23025,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.
23026,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,You held a knife to his throat.
23027,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"You said, ""I did warn you not the trust me."""
23028,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"You told our mother this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister, but that was another one of your lies. It was yours."
23029,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you."
23030,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?
23031,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"If we could speak alone, I can explain everything."
23032,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother and Aunt Lysa and that’s what you tried to do to us."
23033,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"Sansa, please."
23034,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn."
23035,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.
23036,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,(Nods.)
23037,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,(to Yohn Royce) I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.
23038,yohn royce,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,I think not.
23039,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy."
23040,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"And yet, you betrayed her."
23041,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,I loved you. More than anyone.
23042,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"And yet, you betrayed me."
23043,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,"When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them."
23044,petyr baelish,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Great Hall of Winterfell_1,Sansa! (GASPS) I--
23045,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.
23047,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell."
23048,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,Ser Jaime.
23049,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,Your Grace.
23050,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"My lords, I need a moment with my brother."
23052,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,What are you doing?
23053,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,Preparing the expedition north.
23054,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?"
23055,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.
23056,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father? ? You expect me to command our troops to fight beside foreign scum, to fight for the Dragon Queen?"
23057,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.
23058,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"And I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?"
23059,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!"
23060,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen defend the North. We stay here where we’ve always been.
23061,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,I made a promise.
23062,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,Our child will rule Westeros.
23063,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,Our child will never be born if the dead come south.
23064,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us."
23065,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,And then what?
23066,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,And then we rule.
23067,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!"
23068,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.
23069,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.
23070,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,How many dragons did you see at the pit?
23071,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,Two.
23072,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,What happened to the third?
23073,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!"
23074,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable."
23075,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!
23076,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You should've listened more when Father spoke about the importance of gold. Oh, I know it’s boring for you. You just wanted to hunt and ride and fight. But I listened, I learned. Highgarden bought us the most powerful army in Essos, the Golden Company. Twenty thousand men, horses, elephants, I believe."
23077,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
23078,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen? No one walks away from me. He’s sailing with his fleet to Essos, he’s going to ferry the Golden Company back here to help us win the war for Westeros."
23079,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander of your armies?"
23080,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen."
23081,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,I didn't conspire with him.
23082,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.
23083,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.
23084,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,And that will be treason.
23085,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,Treason?
23086,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"Disobeying your queen's command, fighting with her enemies, what would you call it?"
23087,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,Doesn't matter what I'd call it.
23088,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,I told you no one walks away from me.
23089,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father is gone. It’s just me and you now."
23090,cersei lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,There's one more yet to come.
23091,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,"Give the order, then."
23092,jaime lannister,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing._1,I  don't believe you.
23093,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,Come in.
23094,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,Samwell Tarly.
23095,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.
23096,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,I remember everything.
23097,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,You helped us get beyond the Wall. You're a good man.
23098,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,"Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?"
23099,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,I became the Three-Eyed Raven.
23100,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,Oh! I don't know what that means.
23101,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,I can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell?
23102,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,"Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him."
23103,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,He's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen.
23104,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,"You, you saw this  in a vision?"
23105,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,Oh.
23106,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,He needs to know the truth.
23107,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,The truth about what?
23108,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,"About himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt, Lyanna Stark. He was born in a tower in Dorne. His last name isn’t really Snow. It’s Sand."
23109,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,It's not.
23110,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,Dornish bastards are named Sand.
23111,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,"At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony."
23112,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,Are you certain?
23113,sam,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Interior_1,It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?
23114,rhaegar targaryen,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback_1,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days."
23115,lyanna stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback_1,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days."
23116,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback_1,"Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie. Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt, or rape her."
23117,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Boat interior_1,He loved her. And she loved him.
23118,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback_3,And Jon -  Jon's real name.
23119,lyanna stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Flashback_3,"His name is Aegon Targaryen. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned."
23120,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Boat Interior_1,He's never been a bastard-- he’s the heir to the Iron Throne.
23121,bran stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Boat Interior_1,He needs to know. We need to tell him.
23122,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3,Are you all right?
23123,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3,"It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me."
23124,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3,You did the right thing.
23125,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3,You did it.
23126,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3,I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady of Winterfell.
23127,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3,Does that bother you?
23128,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3,I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.
23129,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3,You would have. You're the strongest person I know.
23130,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3,I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
23131,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3,"Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying."
23132,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3,"""In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another."""
23133,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3,"Father. ‘When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives."
23134,arya stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3,I miss him.
23135,sansa stark,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,Winterfell Exterior_3,"Me, too."
23136,beric dondarrion,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Wall._1,It's a long way down.
23137,tormund,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Wall._1,Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.
23140,tormund,7,67,the dragon and the wolf,The Wall._1,Come on!  Run! Run!
23141,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE_1,You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won’t freeze off.
23142,varys,8,68,winterfell,HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE_1,"You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?"
23143,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE_1,"Because I have balls, and you don't."
23144,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE_1,I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
23145,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,Look at you.
23146,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,You're a man.
23147,bran stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,Almost.
23148,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,Where's Arya?
23149,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,Lurking somewhere.
23150,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,"Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell."
23151,daenerys targaryen,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,"Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you."
23152,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,"Winterfell is yours, Your Grace."
23153,bran stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.
23154,bran stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE_1,"He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south."
23155,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,"As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?"
23156,smalljon umber,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,"We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady."
23157,smalljon umber,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,And my lord.
23158,smalljon umber,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,And my queen. Sorry.
23159,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.
23160,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.
23161,wolkan,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,"At once, Your Grace."
23162,lyanna mormont,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,"""Your Grace."""
23163,lyanna stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,But you’re not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I’m not sure what you are now.
23164,lyanna stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,A lord? Nothing at all?
23165,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,It's not important.
23166,lyanna stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,Not important? We named you King in the North.
23168,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,"You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I’ll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North."
23169,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,"If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause."
23170,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,"I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die."
23171,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,"May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?"
23172,daenerys targaryen,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL_1,Whatever they want.
23173,gendry,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,"Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it."
23175,gendry,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,Are these the last of the wagons?
23177,gendry,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,"All right, let's get it all to the forges."
23178,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,My lord. My lady.
23179,yohn royce,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,My lady.
23180,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.
23181,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,"So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose."
23182,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.
23183,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,It had its moments.
23184,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,Apologies for leaving like that.
23185,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,"Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder."
23186,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,We both survived.
23187,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.
23188,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,"I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-"
23189,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?
23190,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,She did.
23191,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,And you believed her?
23192,tyrion lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
23193,sansa stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_15,I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
23194,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,You used to be taller.
23195,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,How did you sneak up on me?
23196,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,How did you survive a knife through the heart?
23197,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,I didn't.
23198,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,You still have it.
23199,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,Needle.
23200,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,Have you ever used it?
23201,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,Once or twice.
23202,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,Valyrian steel.
23203,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,Jealous?
23204,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,Too heavy for me.
23205,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,Where were you before? I could've used your help with Sansa.
23206,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,"She doesn't like your queen, does she?"
23207,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
23208,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,She's the smartest person I've ever met.
23209,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,Now you're defending her?
23210,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,You?
23211,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,I'm defending our family. So is she.
23212,jon snow,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,Yeah. I'm her family too.
23213,arya stark,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,Don't forget that.EXT – KING'S LANDING - DAYPan down from a view of the Red Keep to see QYBURN walking up to CERSEI LANNISTER who stares out at the sea.
23214,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,"Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall."
23215,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_1,Good.
23216,yara greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1,Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?
23217,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1,But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.
23218,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1,If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?
23219,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1,I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.
23220,yara greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1,Are we in King's Landing?
23221,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1,Mm.
23222,yara greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1,You picked the losing side.
23223,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1,Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.
23224,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,EURON'S SHIP - CABIN_1,But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.
23225,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,"Twenty-thousand men, is it?"
23226,harry strickland,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,"Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit."
23227,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.
23228,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,Horses?
23229,harry strickland,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,Two thousand.
23230,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,And elephants?
23231,harry strickland,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,"Uh, no elephants, Your Grace."
23232,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.
23233,harry strickland,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,"They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages."
23234,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,"In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland."
23235,harry strickland,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,"We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace."
23236,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,Am I most welcome here?
23237,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.
23238,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,Good. As a true friend and an honored guest
23239,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,I was hoping we could talk in private.
23240,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,After the war. That was our agreement.
23241,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,Wars sometimes last years.
23242,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,"You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her."
23243,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,How?
23244,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,"I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken."
23245,cersei lannister,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,You're insolent. I've executed men for less.
23246,euron greyjoy,8,68,winterfell,RED KEEP – GREAT HALL_1,They were lesser men.
23247,dirah (prostitue),8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.
23248,craya,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,Burnt up some of my favorite boys.
23249,dirah (prostitue),8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,"Archie, was it?"
23250,craya,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,And William.
23251,dirah (prostitue),8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,Tall handsome William?
23252,craya,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,"Yeah, tall handsome William."
23253,dirah (prostitue),8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.
23254,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.
23255,craya,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,Did you?
23256,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,Nearly killed it.
23257,marei,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,That's brave.
23258,craya,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,That boy Eddie.
23259,dirah (prostitue),8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,The ginger?
23260,craya,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.
23261,dirah (prostitue),8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,How does he sleep with no eyelids?
23262,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,"All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"
23263,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
23264,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,You're kidding me.
23265,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,"Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry."
23266,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,"Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps."
23267,craya,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.
23268,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.
23269,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,Which girl?
23270,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
23271,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,"She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them."
23272,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,"That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside."
23273,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,"So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-"
23274,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.
23275,bronn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,"Yeah, well, good luck with that."
23276,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-
23277,qyburn,8,68,winterfell,KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL_1,She has a keen sense of poetic justice.

23463,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,"Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat."
23464,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,"You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours."
23465,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,"Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again."
23466,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,The things we do for love.
23467,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,So why have you abandoned your house and family now?
23468,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,Because this goes beyond loyalty.
23469,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,This is about survival.
23470,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,"You don't know me well, Your Grace."
23471,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,"But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it."
23472,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,"Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother."
23473,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,You vouch for him?
23474,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,I do.
23475,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,You would fight beside him?
23476,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,I would.
23477,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,"I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay."
23478,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,What does the Warden of the North say about it?
23479,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,We need every man we can get.
23480,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,Very well.
23481,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,Unnamed Scene_100,"Thank you, Your Grace."
23482,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY_1,"Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool."
23483,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY_1,I was a fool.
23484,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY_1,Not for the first time.
23485,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY_1,"Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can."
23486,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – HALLWAY_1,I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.
23487,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,Don't you have something better to do?
23488,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,You make my weapon yet?
23489,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.
23490,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.
23491,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,It's strong enough.
23492,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,"It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know."
23493,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,Are you going to be down in the crypt?
23494,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,"No, but-"
23495,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,But you're a fighter.
23496,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,I've done my share.
23497,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,You've fought them?
23498,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,I did. Some of them.
23499,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,How many?
23500,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,A few. That was enough.
23501,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,What are they like?
23502,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,Bad. Really bad.
23503,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,"""Really bad""?"
23504,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,"Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?"
23505,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,"Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-this is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like."
23506,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,I know Death.
23507,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,He's got many faces.
23508,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,I look forward to seeing this one.
23509,arya stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,My weapon?
23510,gendry,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - FORGES_1,I'll get right on it.
23511,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3,I'm sorry for what I did to you.
23512,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3,You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.
23513,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3,I'm not that person anymore.
23514,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3,"You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark."
23515,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3,You're not?
23516,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3,No. I'm something else now.
23517,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3,You're not angry at me.
23518,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3,I'm not angry at anyone.
23519,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3,Why didn't you tell them?
23520,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3,You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.
23521,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3,What about afterwards?
23522,bran stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD_3,How do you know there is an afterwards?
23523,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,"Well, here we are."
23524,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,"Yes, here we are."
23525,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,Together again.
23526,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,And the masses rejoice.
23527,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,How do they feel about their new queen?
23528,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,She's your new queen too.
23529,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.
23530,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,And she is? Different?
23531,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,She is.
23532,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,You're sure about her?
23533,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,I am.
23534,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,She didn't seem sure about you.
23535,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
23536,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,Hmm.
23537,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
23538,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,Was she lying about the baby too?
23539,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,"No, that part is real."
23540,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.
23541,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,What?
23542,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,"She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."
23543,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,"So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I would've chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-"
23545,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,Your cock.
23546,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,My cock.
23547,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
23548,tyrion lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD_19,Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.
23549,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,Ser Jaime.
23550,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,Lady Brienne.
23551,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,He's come a long way.
23552,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,He's alright. Still has a lot to learn.
23553,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.
23554,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,"I am. It's, uh-it's good ground."
23555,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,It is.
23556,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,"The rise, it should give us some advantage."
23557,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,"If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back."
23558,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,"Yes, I think you're right."
23559,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,What are you doing?
23560,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,What?
23561,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,I think you know.
23562,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,I truly don't.
23563,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.
23564,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,You want me to insult you?
23565,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,No!
23566,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,Good.
23567,jaime lannister,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,"I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me."
23568,brienne of tarth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE_1,I better get back.
23569,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1,"Forgive me, khaleesi."
23570,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1,Have you done something to offend me?
23571,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1,Many things.
23572,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1,Long ago and long forgiven.
23573,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1,"But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart."
23574,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1,"When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again."
23575,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1,You made the right choice.
23576,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1,I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
23577,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1,I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
23578,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1,But the mind behind all those words-
23579,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1,He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.
23580,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1,As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.
23581,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1,You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?
23582,jorah mormont,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS_1,"I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me."
23583,yohn royce,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,"The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates."
23584,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.
23585,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,"Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone."
23586,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.
23587,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,"Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone."
23588,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
23589,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.
23590,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
23591,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,"I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei."
23592,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,You never should have either.
23593,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,I thought he knew his sister.
23594,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,Families are complicated.
23595,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,Ours certainly have been.
23596,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,A sad thing to have in common.
23597,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,"We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell."
23598,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,"And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother."
23599,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,"He loves you, you know that."
23600,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,That bothers you.
23601,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.
23602,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,"All my life, I've known one goal"
23603,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.
23604,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,"I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about."
23605,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,Who was the first?
23606,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,Someone taller.
23607,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,"And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?"
23608,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,I take the Iron Throne.
23609,sansa stark,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,"What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?"
23610,wolkan,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,"Apologies, my lady. Your Grace."
23611,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL - LIBRARY_3,What is it?
23612,theon greyjoy,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,My queen.
23613,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,Your sister?
23614,theon greyjoy,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name."
23615,daenerys targaryen,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,But why aren't you with her?
23616,theon greyjoy,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL_1,"I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me."
23618,davos seaworth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1,"You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way."
23620,gilly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1,"When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts."
23621,gilly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1,They're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.
23623,teela,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1,Which way should I go?
23624,davos seaworth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1,Which way do you want to go?
23625,teela,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1,All the children will be going below when the time comes.
23626,teela,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1,But both me brothers were soldiers. I want to fight too.
23627,gilly,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1,"That's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us."
23628,davos seaworth,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1,I'm sure a lot of people would.
23629,teela,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1,"All right. I'll defend the crypt, then."
23630,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1,My little crow.
23631,jon snow,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1,I thought we'd lost you.
23632,tormund,8,69,a knight of the seven kingdoms,WINTERFELL – COURTYARD_1,Almost.

24072,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL GREAT HALL, LATER_1","We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?"
24073,davos seaworth,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1,"The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again."
24074,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1,I'm sure you had your reasons.
24075,davos seaworth,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1,I did. I do.
24076,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1,So did you?
24077,davos seaworth,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1,"Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?"
24078,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1,I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.
24079,davos seaworth,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1,And what if I'm not trying to be happy?
24080,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL_1,"Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with."

24083,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1,This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.
24084,bran stark,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1,It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one.
24085,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1,You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.
24086,bran stark,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1,I'm not Lord of Winterfell.
24087,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL_1,You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.

24112,brienne of tarth,8,71,the last of the starks,A NEARBY TABLE_1,Why does he get to go again?
24113,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,A NEARBY TABLE_1,Because it's my game.
24114,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,A NEARBY TABLE_1,You have danced with Renly Baratheon.

24122,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9,I did. That's why we all agreed to follow him. That's the kind of man he is.
24123,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9,(laughing) He's little but he's strong. Strong enough to befriend an enemy and get murdered for it!
24124,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9,"Most people get bloody murdered, they stay that way."
24125,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9,Not this one.
24126,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9,"Yeah, I didn't have much say in that."
24127,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9,"Ah! He comes back and keeps fighting. Here, north of the Wall, and then back here again. He keeps fighting. He keeps fighting."
24128,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,THE HEAD TABLE_9,He climbed on a fucking dragon and fought. What kind of person climbs on a fucking dragon? A madman or a king!

24149,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1",Maybe you should be.
24150,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1","Well, Clegane, it's time to drown our sorrows."
24151,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1",I'm not done with my drink.

24160,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1",And what's that?
24161,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1",That's my fucking business.
24162,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1",Used to be you couldn't look at me.
24163,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,"THE GREAT HALL, LATER_1",That was a long time ago. I've seen much worse than you since then.

24280,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,"She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so... Say something snide."
24281,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,I'm happy. I'm happy that you're happy. I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb for it.
24282,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,Do you know how long I've waited to tell tall person jokes? To climbing mountains.
24283,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,To climbing mountains.

24290,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,"Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. Where's your drink? What are you, what are you doing up North?"
24291,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,What are you doing with that?
24292,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,"Oh, this? This is for you. For both of you."
24293,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,You're supposed to be south.
24294,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts. Do you know that?
24295,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,That's a bit rude.
24296,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,"Year after year, I've shoveled Lannister shit, and what do I have to show?"
24297,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,"You're a knight, thanks to me."
24298,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,Thanks to me. And that title's worth as much as a blonde hair from your brother's ballsack.

24300,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,Shut your mouth.
24301,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,I'm just trying-
24302,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,"I've never hit a dwarf before, but say another word and I will belt you."
24303,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,"See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all-"
24304,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,"You couldn't do it on your best day, you one-handed fuck. And your best days are long gone."
24305,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,You broke my nose!
24306,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,I did not break your nose.
24307,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,How do you know?
24308,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,"Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size, and I know what it sounds like. Now listen. Your sister offered me Riverrun. Nice big castle, good lands, plenty of peasants who do what they're told."
24309,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,And you trust Cersei-
24310,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,"I knew your sister was dead the second I saw those dragons. Now, your army may be torn to shit, but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win. And it just so happens I'm a betting man. If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up."
24311,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,"Mmm, that's good. Of course, the odds change if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead. Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one. All of a sudden-"
24312,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,May I speak?
24313,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,Why not? Only death will shut you up.
24314,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,We made a deal long ago. Do you remember?
24315,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,"If anyone offered me money to kill you, you'd pay me double. What's double Riverrun?"
24316,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,Highgarden. You could be Lord of the Reach.
24317,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,Highgarden? Are you mad?
24318,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,It's better than being dead.
24319,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,He's not going to kill us. He wouldn't be talking to us if-
24320,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,"The way I see it, I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive."
24321,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.
24322,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,"No? Who were your ancestors, the ones who made your family rich? Fancy lads in silk? They were fucking cutthroats. That's how all the great houses started, isn't it? With a hard bastard who was good at killing people. Kill a few hundred people, they make you a lord. Kill a few thousand, they make you king. And then all your cocksucking grandsons can ruin the family with their cocksucking ways."
24323,bronn,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,Highgarden. Give me your word.
24324,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL HOUSE_1,You have my word. None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing. We ride south in the morning. We could use an officer with knowledge of the city's defenses.
24325,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1",For fuck's sake.
24327,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1",Not anymore. I don't like crowds.
24328,arya stark,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1",Me neither.
24329,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1",Why not? They all love you now. You're the big hero.
24330,arya stark,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1",Don't like heroes.
24331,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1",It must have felt good sticking a knife in that horned fucker.
24332,arya stark,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1",Felt better than dying. You're heading to King's Landing?
24333,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1",I have some unfinished business.
24334,arya stark,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1",Me too.
24335,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1",I don't plan on coming back.

24337,sandor clegane,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1",Gonna leave me to die again if I get hurt?
24338,arya stark,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL, DAY_1",Probably.
24339,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,My lady.
24340,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,"""My lord"" is the standard response."
24341,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,Why her?
24342,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,You know she loves your brother.
24343,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.
24344,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,"You seem determined to dislike her. A good relationship between the Iron Throne and the North has been the core of every peaceful, prosperous reign we've ever known."
24345,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,"Jon will be Warden of the North, so a good relationship seems likely."
24346,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.
24347,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,"Well, I suppose that's up to him."
24348,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,"Sansa, look at me."
24349,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,"With Jon in the capital, you'll be the true power in the North. I'd feel much better about the future if I left here today believing that you and Daenerys were allies."
24350,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,What are you worried about? Jon's taking our army with him. Your queen still has her dragons--
24351,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,She's your queen too.
24352,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,"You don't have to be her friend. But why provoke her? How is that in the best interest of your family, or the North, or-"
24353,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,You're afraid of her.
24354,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.
24355,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,I don't want Jon to go down there. The men in my family don't do well in the capital.
24356,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,"No, but as your brother once told me, he's not a Stark."
24357,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,Are you all right?
24358,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,"Her people love her, you've seen that. You've seen how they fight for her. She wants to make the world a better place. I believe in her."
24359,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,Tyrion.
24360,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL WALKWAY_1,What if there's someone else? Someone better?
24361,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,You're not gonna ride the dragon south?
24362,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,Just a horse. Rhaegal needs to heal. He doesn't need me weighing him down.
24363,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,(scoffs). You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.
24364,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,(laughs)
24365,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,I'm taking the Free Folk home. We've had enough of the south. The women down here don't like me.
24366,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,"This is the North, you know. And the Free Folk are welcome to stay."
24367,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,It isn't home. We need room to wander. I'll take them back through Castle Black as soon as the winter storms pass. Back where we belong.
24368,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,It's where he belongs too. A direwolf has no place in the south. Will you take him with you? He'll be happier up there.
24369,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,So would you.
24370,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,"I wish I was going with you. This is farewell, then."
24371,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,You never know.
24372,tormund,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,You've got the North in you. The real North.
24373,sam,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,"Yes, well, the nights have been getting longer and there wasn't that much to do in Oldtown. There's only so many books a person can read, so we-"
24374,gilly,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,"I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam. If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon."
24375,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,I hope it's a girl.
24376,sam,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,You're the best friend I ever had.
24377,jon snow,8,71,the last of the starks,WINTERFELL COURTYARD_13,"You too, Sam."
24378,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"Think of the past twenty years. The war, the murder, the misery. All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone who didn't love him back."
24379,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,How many others know?
24380,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,Including us? Eight.
24381,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"Well, then it's not a secret anymore. It's information. If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon. Then what happens?"
24382,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"She loses the North. She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that."
24383,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"No, it's worse than that. He has the better claim to the throne."
24384,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,He doesn't want the throne.
24385,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"I'm not sure it matters what he wants. The fact is, people are drawn to him. Wildlings, Northmen. He's a war hero."
24386,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"He loves our queen. And she loves him. If we marry them, they could rule together."
24387,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,(with distaste) She's his aunt.
24388,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,That never stopped a Targaryen before.
24389,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,"No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell. Is marrying your aunt common in the North? You know our queen better than I do. Do you think she wants to share the throne? She does not like to have her authority questioned."
24390,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,Something she has in common with every monarch who ever lived.
24391,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,I worry about her state of mind.
24392,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS_1,We are advisors to the queen. Worrying about her state of mind is our job. We still have to take King's Landing. Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all. That would solve our problems.

That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep. These are the people you came here to protect. I beg you, Your Grace. Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat."
24421,daenerys targaryen,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1,"Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys? I'm here to free the world from tyrants. That is my destiny and I will serve it, no matter the cost."
24422,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1,"It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies make it to King's Landing. In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender. Offer her her life in exchange for the throne. If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter, we should make the effort."
24423,daenerys targaryen,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_1,"Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter. But perhaps it's good the people see that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed, and Cersei Lannister refused. They should know whom to blame when the sky falls down upon them."
24424,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,I've served tyrants most of my life. They all talk about destiny.
24425,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones and walked out with three dragons. How could she not believe in destiny?
24426,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,Perhaps that's the problem. Her life has convinced her that she was sent here to save us all.
24427,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,And how do you know she wasn't?
24428,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,"Then there's the problem of Jon Snow. Perhaps it's actually a solution. You know them both. Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler?"
24429,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,He doesn't want the throne. That's why he bent the knee.
24430,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,Have you considered the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule?
24431,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,We're discussing treason.
24432,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.
24433,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,Of course I've thought about it. Thoughts aren't treason.
24434,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,"He's temperate and measured. He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros, whose support we are going to need."
24435,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,"Joffrey was a man. I don't think a cock is a true qualification, as I'm sure you'd agree."
24436,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,"And he's the heir to the throne. Yes, because he's a man. Cocks are important, I'm afraid."
24437,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,What about my earlier proposal? They could rule together as king and queen.
24438,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,"She's too strong for him. She'd bend him to her will, as she already has."
24439,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,He could temper her worst impulses.
24440,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,As you have? You're drinking quite a lot. A Targaryen father and a Stark mother. Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.
24441,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,How many kings and queens have you served? Five? Six? I've lost count.
24442,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,You've always known my reasons.
24443,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,"At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person."
24444,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,Even if you know it's a mistake?
24445,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,I believe in our queen. She'll make the right choice. With the help of her loyal advisers.
24446,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,You know where my loyalty stands. You know I will never betray the realm.
24447,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,"What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne."
24448,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,"Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne. We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I. They deserve to live. They deserve food for their children. I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost."
24449,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,"So, what happens to her?"
24450,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,Please. Don't.
24451,varys,8,71,the last of the starks,DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM_1,I've spoken as honestly as I can. Each of us has a choice to make. I pray we choose wisely.

24462,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE COURTYARD_3,What happened?
24463,brienne of tarth,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE COURTYARD_3,"Euron Greyjoy ambushed Queen Daenerys and her fleet. One of the dragons was killed, several ships destroyed, Missandei captured."
24464,sansa stark,8,71,the last of the starks,ANOTHER PART OF THE COURTYARD_3,I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister. Seems like I won't get the chance.
24465,brienne of tarth,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1",They're going to destroy that city. You know they will.
24466,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1",Have you ever run away from a fight?
24467,brienne of tarth,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1",You're not like your sister. You're not. You're better than she is. You're a good man and you can't save her. You don't need to die with her. Stay here. Stay with me. (voice breaking) Please. Stay.
24468,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1","You think I'm a good man? I pushed a boy out a tower window, crippled him for life for Cersei. I strangled my cousin with my own hands just to get back to Cersei. I would have murdered every man, woman and child in Riverrun for Cersei."
24469,jaime lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD, NIGHT_1",She's hateful. And so am I.

24480,qyburn,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1","My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen."
24481,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1",Your queen.
24482,qyburn,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1",Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. You are her subject.
24483,tyrion lannister,8,71,the last of the starks,"OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY_1",Her reign is over. You understand this. Help her understand it.

I know this. I know this because I've seen it. You've always loved your children. More than yourself, more than Jaime more than anything. I beg you. If not for yourself, then for your child. Your reign is over, but that doesn't mean your life has to end. It doesn't mean your baby has to die."

24497,martha,8,72,the bells,Unnamed Scene_103,Her soldiers.

24504,varys,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1,"She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food."
24505,jon snow,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1,She shouldn't be alone.
24506,varys,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1,You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.
24507,jon snow,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1,Aren't you worried for her?
24508,varys,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1,"I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath."
24509,jon snow,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1,We're not much for riddles where I'm from.
24510,varys,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1,We both know what she's about to do.
24511,jon snow,8,72,the bells,THE BEACH_1,That's her decision to make. She is our queen.

24520,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,Someone has betrayed me.
24521,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,Yes.
24522,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,Jon Snow.
24523,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,Varys.
24524,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,He knows the truth about Jon.
24525,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,He does.
24526,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,"Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me."
24527,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
24528,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,And Varys?
24529,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
24530,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,(angrily) You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.
24531,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,It was a mistake.
24532,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?
24533,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,She trusts me.
24534,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM_3,"Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down."

24546,daenerys targaryen,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT_1",She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.

24553,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,"DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT_1",They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.

24603,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,"The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win."
24604,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,"She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be."
24605,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.
24606,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,The city will fall tomorrow.
24607,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,"She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-"
24608,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.
24609,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,"Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before."
24610,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,Why?
24611,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,"Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life."
24612,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-
24613,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,"There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again."
24614,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,Swear to me.
24615,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,You have my word.
24616,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,"If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered."
24617,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,I'll try.
24618,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,"I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates."
24619,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,Your queen will execute you for this.
24620,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,"If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible."
24621,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,"Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never would've survived my childhood."
24622,jaime lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,You would have.
24623,tyrion lannister,8,72,the bells,INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT_1,You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.

24831,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1,(in Dothraki) Blood of my blood.
24832,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1,You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.
24833,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1,Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms.

24836,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1,(in Valyrian) Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!
24837,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1,(in Valyrian) But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!
24838,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1,"(in Valyrian) From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel."

24840,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1,You freed your brother. You committed treason.
24841,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1,I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.

24844,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1,"Hey, what happened?"
24845,arya stark,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1,I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.
24846,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE TERRACE_1,(sighs) She's everyone's queen now.

24851,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,No.
24852,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, ""See, I told you."" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going."
24853,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,(sighs)
24854,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,So is there life after death?
24855,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,Not that I've seen.
24856,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.
24857,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,You didn't.
24858,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not."
24859,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.
24860,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?"
24861,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.
24862,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today."
24863,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
24864,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister."
24865,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day."
24866,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,Cersei left her no choice.
24867,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"The moment the gates fell, the battle was over."
24868,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
24869,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,And she burned down a city for it.
24870,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield."
24871,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,Would you have done it?
24872,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,What?
24873,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?"
24874,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,I don't know.
24875,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"(scoffs) Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know."
24876,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,What's it matter what I'd do?

24879,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
24880,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.
24881,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"""Love is the death of duty."""
24882,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,You just came up with that?
24883,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
24884,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"
24885,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?
24886,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,That's her decision. She is the queen.
24887,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,I'm sorry it came to this.
24888,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?
24889,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
24890,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
24891,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,She doesn't get to choose.
24892,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,TYRION'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,No. But you do. And you have to choose now.
24893,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,"When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet."
24894,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
24895,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,It was necessary.
24896,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,"Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!"
24897,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.
24898,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,And Tyrion?
24899,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,"He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?"
24900,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,Forgive him.
24901,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,I can't.
24902,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,"You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand."
24903,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,"Please, Dany."
24904,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.
24905,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.
24906,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.
24907,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?
24908,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,Because I know what is good. And so do you.
24909,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,I don't.
24910,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,You do. You do. You've always known.
24911,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.
24912,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,They don't get to choose.
24913,daenerys targaryen,8,73,the iron throne,THE THRONE ROOM_11,"Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastard's name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together."

24916,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",He is our prisoner.
24917,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.
24918,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",We will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.
24919,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1","If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest."
24920,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.
24921,yara greyjoy,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
24922,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",You swore to follow a tyrant.
24923,yara greyjoy,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1","She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves."
24924,arya stark,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.
24925,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1","Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?"
24926,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1","If it weren't for you and your men, we would've lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way."
24927,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",We do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.
24928,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",It's not for you to decide.
24929,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.
24930,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",(nods) You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.
24931,yohn royce,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",We don't have a king or queen.
24932,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.

24936,yohn royce,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1","Well, we have to choose someone."
24937,sam,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",Why just us?
24938,sam,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1","Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone."
24939,edmure tully,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.
24940,yohn royce,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",I'll ask my horse.
24941,edmure tully,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",(to TYRION) I suppose you want the crown.
24942,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",Me? The Imp?
24943,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1","Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her."

24945,davos seaworth,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1","Who, then?"
24946,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.
24947,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1","What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?"
24948,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
24949,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1","Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break."

24952,bran stark,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",Why do you think I came all this way?
24953,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.

24967,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1","I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king.

24973,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1","I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else."
24974,bran stark,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",I choose you.
24975,grey worm,8,73,the iron throne,"AN ARCADE, DAY_1",You cannot.

24980,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.
24981,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,There's still a Night's Watch?
24982,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.
24983,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,(sighs)
24984,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,"You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose."
24985,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,Was it right? What I did?
24986,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,What we did.
24987,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,It doesn't feel right.
24988,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,Ask me again in ten years.
24989,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.
24990,tyrion lannister,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.
24991,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,JON'S MAKESHIFT CELL_1,(nods)

24994,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1,I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?

24996,sansa stark,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1,But they lost their king.
24997,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1,Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.

25004,jon snow,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1,(chuckles) I don't know.
25005,arya stark,8,73,the iron throne,KING'S LANDING SEA WALL_1,No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.
